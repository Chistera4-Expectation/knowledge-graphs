text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Five Spice Powder and flavor
  enhancers serve to add flavor to food, they are distinct types of seasoning. Five
  Spice Powder is a specific blend of spices, while flavor enhancers encompass a broader
  category of ingredients used to boost the taste of food, such as MSG, yeast extract,
  and umami-rich ingredients.
