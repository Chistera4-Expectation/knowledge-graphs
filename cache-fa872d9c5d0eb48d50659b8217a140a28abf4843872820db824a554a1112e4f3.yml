text: No, Poppy Seeds and Seeds should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Poppy Seeds are a specific type of seed, while Seeds is a broader category
  encompassing various types of seeds. Merging them would result in a loss of distinction
  between different types of seeds.
