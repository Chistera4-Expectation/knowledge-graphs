text: No, Australian Yogurt and Kefir Yogurt should not be merged together as they
  are different types of yogurt. Australian Yogurt refers to yogurt that is produced
  in Australia, while Kefir Yogurt refers to a specific type of yogurt made using
  kefir grains, which results in a slightly different texture and flavor profile.
