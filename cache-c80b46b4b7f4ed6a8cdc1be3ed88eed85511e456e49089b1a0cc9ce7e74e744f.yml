text: No, they should not be merged. Scent leaves (also known as Nchuanwu) and other
  leafy greens are different types of vegetables with distinct characteristics, nutritional
  profiles, and cultural significance. Although they may share some similarities,
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
