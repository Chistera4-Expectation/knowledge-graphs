  Achiote paste and garlic paste are not semantic or ontological duplicates, despite
  both being types of pastes used for seasoning food. They have different ingredients
  (achiote paste is made from annatto seeds, while garlic paste is made from garlic),
  flavors, uses, and cultural origins. Therefore, they should remain separate instances
  in a Food Seasoning class.'
