text: 'No, the instances ''Pheasant Broth'' and ''Pheasant'' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different food items: ''Pheasant
  Broth'' is a liquid made by boiling pheasant meat and other ingredients, while ''Pheasant''
  refers to the meat itself. They may be related, but they are not duplicates.'
