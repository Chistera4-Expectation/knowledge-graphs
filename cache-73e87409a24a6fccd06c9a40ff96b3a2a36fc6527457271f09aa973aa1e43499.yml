text: ' No. Corned beef and organic beef are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They refer to different types of beef products with distinct preparation methods
  and qualities. Corned beef is a type of preserved beef that has been salt-cured
  while organic beef refers to meat from cattle raised without the use of synthetic
  pesticides, growth hormones, antibiotics, and genetically modified feed. Therefore,
  they should remain separate instances.'
