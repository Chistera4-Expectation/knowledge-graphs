text: 'No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are types of edible oils, they are derived from different sources and have
  different properties and uses.


  Apricot kernel oil is extracted from the kernels of apricots and is often used in
  cosmetics and skincare products due to its moisturizing and nourishing properties.
  It can also be used in cooking, but it is not a common cooking oil.


  Cooking oil, on the other hand, is a broader term that encompasses various types
  of oils derived from plants and used for cooking purposes. Examples include olive
  oil, vegetable oil, and canola oil. Each type of cooking oil has its own unique
  properties and uses, depending on factors like smoke point, flavor, and nutritional
  content.


  Merging ''Apricot Kernel Oil'' and ''Cooking oil'' as semantic and ontologic duplicates
  would not accurately represent the differences between these two types of oils.'
