  While chicken broth and chicken soup are both poultry-derived foods and may seem
  similar, they have distinct differences that warrant them to be considered separate
  entities from an ontological perspective. Chicken broth is typically a liquid made
  by simmering chicken parts (such as bones, feet, and scraps) with vegetables, herbs,
  and spices. It often serves as a base for other dishes like soups, stews, sauces,
  and rice dishes due to its rich flavor profile and high collagen content. On the
  other hand, chicken soup consists of chicken broth along with additional ingredients
  such as meat, vegetables, grains, or pasta. The term "chicken soup" generally implies
  a more substantial dish than just plain chicken broth. Therefore, I would not recommend
  merging chicken broth and chicken soup as semantic and ontological duplicates since
  their definitions, uses, and nutritional profiles differ significantly.'
