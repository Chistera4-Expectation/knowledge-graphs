text: ' No. While both "mushrooms" and "wood ear mushrooms" are types of edible fungi,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Wood ear mushrooms (Auricularia
  spp.) are a specific type of mushroom with their own unique characteristics and
  uses, and therefore should be considered separate from the general category of mushrooms.'
