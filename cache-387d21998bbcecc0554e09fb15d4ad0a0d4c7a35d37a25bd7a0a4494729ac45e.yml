text: Yes, as both 'Quail Meat' and 'Quail' refer to the same source - quail, it would
  be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontologic duplicates in the Poultry-derived
  Food class. However, it's essential to maintain the distinction between the two
  terms, as 'Quail' could also refer to the bird itself, while 'Quail Meat' specifically
  refers to the edible part of the bird.
