text: ' No. Long grain white rice and short-grain rice are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, despite both being types of rice. They have distinct differences in
  taste, texture, cooking properties, and traditional uses that make them unique within
  their own categories. Therefore, it is important to keep these two instances separate
  for accurate nutritional information and recipe recommendations.'
