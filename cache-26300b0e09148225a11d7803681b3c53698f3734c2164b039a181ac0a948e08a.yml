text: No, Alkaline Water and Well Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are types of drinking water, they have
  different properties and sources. Alkaline Water is water with a higher pH level,
  while Well Water is water sourced from a well. Merging them together would not accurately
  represent these differences.
