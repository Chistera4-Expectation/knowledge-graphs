text: No, they should not be merged together. While both instances involve seasoning,
  they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Red Pepper Flakes
  for heat primarily adds a spicy flavor, while Seasonings for filling serves the
  purpose of enhancing the overall flavor of a dish. Merging them would result in
  a loss of specificity and clarity in their intended use.
