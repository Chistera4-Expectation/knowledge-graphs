  While chicken nuggets and chicken wings are both poultry-derived foods, they are
  not semantic nor ontological duplicates because they have distinct processing methods,
  nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Chicken nuggets typically consist of formed
  and breaded or battered pieces of ground chicken meat, while chicken wings are usually
  left whole with minimal processing before cooking. These differences result in unique
  taste, texture, and nutrition characteristics that warrant separate categorization.'
