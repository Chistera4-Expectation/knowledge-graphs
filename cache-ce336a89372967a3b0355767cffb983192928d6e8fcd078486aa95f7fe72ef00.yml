text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  they are related in the context of food seasoning, 'Flavor enhancers' typically
  refer to specific substances or ingredients that intensify or improve the flavor
  of a dish, whereas 'flavor' refers to the overall taste or aroma experience of the
  food. They serve different purposes in the context of food seasoning and should
  remain as separate instances.
