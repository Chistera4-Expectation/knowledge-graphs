text: ' No. While grilled chicken and rotisserie chicken are both types of prepared
  poultry dishes, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They differ in
  their cooking methods (grilling vs. roasting), which can result in differences in
  taste, texture, nutritional content, and preparation time. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to keep these two concepts distinct within a well-structured knowledge graph or
  database related to food and nutrition.'
