text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are sauces, they have distinct
  characteristics and ingredients. Curry sauce typically contains curry spices and
  may have a creamy base, while Scotch bonnet pepper sauce is known for its hot and
  spicy flavor from the Scotch bonnet peppers. Merging them would not accurately represent
  the differences between the two sauces.
