text: 'No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of yogurt:
  Lassi Yogurt is a traditional Indian drink made from yogurt, while Vegan Yogurt
  is a type of yogurt made without dairy. They are distinct in terms of their ingredients
  and preparation, and as such, should be considered separate instances within the
  Yogurt class.'
