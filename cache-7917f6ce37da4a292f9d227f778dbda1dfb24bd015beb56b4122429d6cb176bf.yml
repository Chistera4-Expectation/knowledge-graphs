text: No, Argan Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible vegetal oils, they come from different
  plants and have distinct nutritional profiles and uses. Argan Oil is derived from
  the kernels of the argan tree, while Wheat Germ Oil comes from the germ of the wheat
  kernel. These differences make them unique and not duplicates.
