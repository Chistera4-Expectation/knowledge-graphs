  Although both 'Quail Broth' and 'Quail Gravy' are derived from quails, they have
  different properties, uses, and nutritional values. Quail Broth is a liquid made
  by simmering quail meat and bones, while Quail Gravy is a thicker sauce typically
  made by thickening Quail Broth with a starch, such as cornstarch or flour. They
  serve different purposes in cooking and have distinct nutritional profiles.
