text: ' No. Long grain white rice and rice flour are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, they have different properties and uses in cooking. Long grain white
  rice is a whole grain that can be cooked and eaten on its own, while rice flour
  is made from grinding rice grains into a fine powder and used for baking and thickening
  dishes.'
