  While both chicken breasts and chicken salad are made from chicken, they have different
  nutritional profiles due to varying preparation methods and ingredients used in
  each dish. Chicken breast is primarily composed of lean meat with high protein content,
  while chicken salad often includes additional ingredients such as mayonnaise, vegetables,
  or fruits, which can affect its calorie, fat, and carbohydrate content. Therefore,
  these two instances cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates within
  the context of poultry-derived food.'
