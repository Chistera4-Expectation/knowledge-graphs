text: No, Grapeseed Oil and Sesame Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  different properties, flavors, and uses in cooking. Grapeseed Oil is known for its
  light, neutral flavor, while Sesame Oil is known for its nutty aroma. Merging them
  together would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each oil.
