text: No, Chili Powder and Curry Powder should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are food seasonings, they have distinct
  ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. Chili Powder typically contains dried
  and ground chili peppers, cumin, garlic powder, and other spices, while Curry Powder
  is a blend of spices like turmeric, coriander, cumin, and others, which is used
  in Indian and other cuisines to add flavor to dishes. Merging these two seasonings
  would lead to a loss of specificity and accuracy in describing their unique properties
  and uses.
