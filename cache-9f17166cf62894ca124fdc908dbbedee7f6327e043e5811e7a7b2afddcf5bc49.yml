text: No, Mineral Water and Sparkling Water should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they may share some similarities, they are distinct types of water
  with different properties and characteristics. Mineral Water contains naturally
  occurring minerals, while Sparkling Water is carbonated water, often artificially
  infused with carbon dioxide gas.
