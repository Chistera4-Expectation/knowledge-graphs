text: No, 'Turkey Broth' and 'Turkey Nuggets' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both derived from turkey, they are different
  food items with distinct characteristics and uses. Turkey broth is a liquid, while
  turkey nuggets are a solid, meat-based product. They have different nutritional
  profiles and are prepared and consumed differently.
