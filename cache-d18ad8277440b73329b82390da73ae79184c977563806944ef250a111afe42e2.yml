text: 'As a dietician, my expertise is in nutrition and not in programming or computer
  science. However, from a nutrition perspective, ''Black Eye'' and ''Red Eye'' are
  different coffee drinks with distinct ingredients and preparation methods. Therefore,
  it would be appropriate to keep them as separate instances.


  ''Black Eye'' is a coffee drink made by adding two shots of espresso to a regular
  cup of coffee, while ''Red Eye'' is made by adding one shot of espresso to a regular
  cup of coffee. The difference in the number of espresso shots affects the caffeine
  content and flavor profile of the drinks. Thus, they are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.


  To answer your question, no, ''Black Eye'' and ''Red Eye'' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates in the Coffee class.'
