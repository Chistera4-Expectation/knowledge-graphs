text: Yes, in the context of a Drinking Water class, 'Distilled Water' and 'Water'
  can be considered semantic and ontological duplicates since both refer to the same
  base substance, H2O, in its pure form. However, it is essential to consider the
  specific use cases and contexts where these terms are used, as there might be slight
  differences in application or processing methods.
