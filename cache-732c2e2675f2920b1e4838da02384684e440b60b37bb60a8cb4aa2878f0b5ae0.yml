text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both 'Nitro XTreme Energy' and 'XS Energy' are energy drinks, they are distinct
  brands and products with their own unique formulations, ingredients, and marketing.
  Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the Energy Drink
  class.
