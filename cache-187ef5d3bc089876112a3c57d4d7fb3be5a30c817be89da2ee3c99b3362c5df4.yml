text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are spices, they have distinct
  flavors and uses in cooking. Curry powder typically contains a blend of spices like
  turmeric, coriander, cumin, and chili powder, while Kashmiri chili powder is a specific
  type of ground chili pepper with a mild heat and vibrant red color. Merging them
  would not accurately represent their individual characteristics and uses.
