text: No, Sticky Rice and Wild Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they are both types of rice, they have distinct properties,
  uses, and nutritional values. Sticky Rice, also known as glutinous rice, is a type
  of short-grain rice that becomes sticky when cooked, and it is commonly used in
  Asian dishes. Wild Rice, on the other hand, is not a true rice but a grass native
  to North America, and it has a chewy texture and nutty flavor. They should be treated
  as separate entities within the Rice class.
