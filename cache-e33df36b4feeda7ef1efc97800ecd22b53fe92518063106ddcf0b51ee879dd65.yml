text: ' No. While both "roast" and "the coffee" are related to coffee, they refer
  to different aspects of it. Roast level refers to how dark or light the beans have
  been roasted, while "the coffee" generally refers to the drink itself or the beans
  before brewing. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
