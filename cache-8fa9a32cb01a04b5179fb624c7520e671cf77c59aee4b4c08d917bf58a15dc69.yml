  While both dishes contain chicken and could be considered poultry-derived foods,
  they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They differ in their ingredients,
  preparation methods, and cultural contexts. A Chicken Caesar Salad typically consists
  of romaine lettuce, croutons, parmesan cheese, and a dressing made with raw egg
  yolks, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce; whereas, a Chicken
  Pot Pie is a savory baked dish featuring diced chicken, mixed vegetables (such as
  carrots, peas, and onions), and a thick gravy or cream sauce encased in pastry dough.
  The two dishes cater to different meal occasions, tastes, and textures.'
