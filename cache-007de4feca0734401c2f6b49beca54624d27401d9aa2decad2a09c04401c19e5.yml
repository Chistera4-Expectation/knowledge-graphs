text: ' Among the given options, none directly relates to "Colors" as a primary characteristic.
  Adequate classes related to colors in food could be "Color Additives," "Natural
  Food Colors," or "Pigments." However, since these options are not provided, I cannot
  suggest one with certainty. Instead, I recommend considering those options if you
  need a more specific term for foods based on their color characteristics.'
