text: No, the instances 'Carrot' and 'Carrots' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. 'Carrot' refers to an individual vegetable, while 'Carrots'
  refers to a plurality of carrots. Although they are closely related, they represent
  different concepts and should be kept separate.
