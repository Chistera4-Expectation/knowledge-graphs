text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they have similarities, red
  pepper flakes and chili flakes can have different origins and heat levels. Red pepper
  flakes typically include crushed red pepper, which is a blend of different types
  of chili peppers. Chili flakes, on the other hand, can refer to a specific type
  of chili pepper, like cayenne or ancho, which may have a distinct flavor profile
  and heat level.
