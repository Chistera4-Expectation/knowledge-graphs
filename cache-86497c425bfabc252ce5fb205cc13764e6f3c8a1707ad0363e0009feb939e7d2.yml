text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both alkaline water and spring water are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  characteristics. Alkaline water typically has a higher pH level than regular drinking
  water, while spring water is naturally filtered water from underground springs.
  These differences make them unique in their properties and uses.
