text: No, Forbidden Rice (also known as Black Rice) and Long-grain Rice are different
  types of rice with distinct characteristics. They should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Forbidden Rice has a dark purple color, a nutty flavor,
  and is high in antioxidants, while Long-grain Rice has a long, slender grain and
  is often used in dishes like pilaf and stir-fry.
