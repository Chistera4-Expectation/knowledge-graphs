  While both fenugreek seeds and hemp seeds have some similarities (for example, they
  are both sources of fiber), they also have many differences in terms of their nutritional
  profiles, health benefits, and uses. Fenugreek seeds are high in protein, iron,
  magnesium, and manganese, and have been shown to help lower blood sugar levels,
  reduce inflammation, and improve milk production in breastfeeding mothers. Hemp
  seeds, on the other hand, are rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, as well as
  being a complete source of plant-based protein. They may offer potential benefits
  for heart health, skin conditions, and digestive issues.


  Therefore, it is important to maintain separate entries for fenugreek seeds and
  hemp seeds, as they serve different purposes and provide unique nutritional benefits.'
