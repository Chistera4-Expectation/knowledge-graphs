text: ' "Energy Drink" would be the most appropriate category for an energy drink,
  as it is specifically designed to provide a quick boost of energy through ingredients
  like caffeine and sugar. While other drinks such as coffee or tea also contain caffeine,
  they are typically classified separately due to their different preparation methods
  and cultural associations. Similarly, while milk and honey can provide natural sources
  of energy, they fall into different categories based on their nutritional profiles
  and intended uses.'
