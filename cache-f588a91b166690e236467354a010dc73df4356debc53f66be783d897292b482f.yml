text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are derived from chicken,
  they are different types of food products. Chicken tenders are a specific cut of
  chicken meat, typically breaded and fried, while chicken/vegetable stock is a liquid
  broth made from simmering chicken and vegetables. They serve different culinary
  purposes and should be kept separate in the Poultry-derived Food class.
