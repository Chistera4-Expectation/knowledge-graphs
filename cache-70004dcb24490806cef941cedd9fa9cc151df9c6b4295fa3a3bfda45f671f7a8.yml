text: No, Raspberry Honey and Tupelo Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of honey, they are distinct
  types of honey with unique flavors, characteristics, and production processes. Merging
  them would result in a loss of specific information about each type of honey.
