text: No, they should not be merged. Although both instances are related to vegetables,
  they refer to different concepts. 'Vegetable oil for frying' represents a specific
  use of vegetable oil in cooking, while 'Vegetable' refers to the broader category
  of edible plant-based foods. Merging them would result in a loss of specificity
  and clarity in the classification.
