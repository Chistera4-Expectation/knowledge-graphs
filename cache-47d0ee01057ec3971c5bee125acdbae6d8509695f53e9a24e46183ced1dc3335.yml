text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both "Quail Patties" and "Quail Soup" are poultry-derived foods, they are distinct
  dishes with different preparation methods, ingredients, and textures. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each dish.
