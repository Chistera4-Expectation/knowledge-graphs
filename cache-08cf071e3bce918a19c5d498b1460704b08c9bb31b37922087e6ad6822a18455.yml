text: ' No. While both chicken nuggets and chicken are related, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Chicken is a type of poultry, while chicken nuggets are
  a processed food product made from chicken meat. Merging them would result in loss
  of important distinctions between these two concepts.'
