text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are derived from duck, they
  are distinctly different food items with different nutritional profiles and uses
  in cooking. Duck meatballs are a specific preparation of duck meat, while duck stock
  is a liquid made by simmering duck bones and aromatics. They serve different purposes
  in recipes and have different nutritional values.
