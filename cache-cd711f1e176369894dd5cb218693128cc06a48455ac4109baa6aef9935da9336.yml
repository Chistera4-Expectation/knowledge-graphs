text: As a dietician, I can provide an answer based on the nutritional content of
  the drinks. While white wine and wine can be considered as the same type of alcoholic
  beverage, they can be differentiated based on their subcategories and specific types.
  For example, white wine can include Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, and Pinot Grigio,
  while wine can encompass both red and white varieties. Therefore, it is not necessary
  to merge them as semantic and ontologic duplicates, as they can be differentiated
  based on their subcategories and specific types.
