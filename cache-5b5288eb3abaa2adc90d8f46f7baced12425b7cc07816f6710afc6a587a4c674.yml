text: ' No. While "Fresh Mozzarella Cheese" and "Mozzarella Cheese" may seem similar,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They refer to different types of
  mozzarella cheese. Regular mozzarella can be low-moisture and aged, while fresh
  mozzarella is made from pasteurized milk and has a high moisture content. Merging
  them would result in loss of important distinctions between these two varieties.'
