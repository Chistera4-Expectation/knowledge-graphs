  While "Name of the cheese" could serve as a general attribute for any instance of
  cheese, including Parmesan cheese, it would not be appropriate to merge them together
  as they represent different concepts. "Parmesan cheese" is a specific type of cheese
  with its own unique characteristics and properties, whereas "Name of the cheese"
  is simply an attribute that can describe various types of cheeses. Therefore, these
  two instances should remain separate within the cheese class.'
