text: ' No. While "onion" (singular) and "onions" (plural) refer to the same type
  of vegetable, they are not considered duplicates in a dietary or nutritional context.
  The distinction between singular and plural forms is important for accurate labeling,
  meal planning, portion control, and recipe instructions. Therefore, it would be
  appropriate to maintain them as separate entries in an edible vegetable class within
  a dietetic or ontological framework.'
