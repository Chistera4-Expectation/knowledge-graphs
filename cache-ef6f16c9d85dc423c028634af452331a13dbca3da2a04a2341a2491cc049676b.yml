text: ' Sure! Here are some possible instance variables (or "names") that could be
  used in a `Spice` class:

  ```python

  name

  type

  origin

  flavor_profile

  heat_level

  health_benefits

  substitutes

  pairing_suggestions

  ```

  These variable names describe different properties or characteristics of a spice.
  For example, the `name` variable would hold the common name of the spice, while
  the `type` variable might indicate whether it is a leaf, seed, bark, root, etc.
  The `origin` variable could specify where the spice originated from, and so on.
  These instance variables can then be used to provide information about individual
  spices and their uses in cooking.'
