  While horseradish dressing and tahini dressing may both fall under the category
  of "food dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantically,
  they have different meanings: horseradish dressing is made with grated horseradish,
  vinegar, and sometimes other ingredients like mustard or cream, while tahini dressing
  is made from sesame seed paste, lemon juice, garlic, and water. Ontologically, they
  represent distinct entities that possess unique properties and serve different culinary
  purposes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
