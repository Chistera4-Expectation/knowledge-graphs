  While pumpkin seed oil and sunflower oil may share some similarities as types of
  edible vegetable oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come
  from different plants (pumpkins vs sunflowers), have distinct nutritional profiles,
  flavors, uses, and production methods. Therefore, it is important to maintain them
  as separate entries with their unique properties and characteristics.'
