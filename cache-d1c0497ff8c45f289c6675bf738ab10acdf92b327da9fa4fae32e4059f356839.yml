text: ' The most appropriate class for "Flavorings: Vanillin, Monosodium Glutamate"
  would be " Food Seasoning". This is because flavorings are substances added to food
  to enhance or modify their taste and smell. Both vanillin and monosodium glutamate
  (MSG) function as seasonings by adding flavors to foods.'
