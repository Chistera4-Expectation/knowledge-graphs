text: ' The most adequate class for "Corn masa" would be "Edible Vegetable". Masa
  is made from dried corn that has been treated with an alkaline solution, which makes
  it easier to grind into flour. While it may not fit perfectly into any of the categories
  you provided, "Edible Vegetable" is the closest match since corn is a type of vegetable.
  However, if you have a more specific category like "Flours and Starches", then "Corn
  masa" might fit better there.'
