  While canola oil and soybean oil are both vegetable oils that have some similar
  uses and nutritional profiles, they come from different plants and have distinct
  properties. Canola oil is derived from rapeseed, while soybean oil comes from soybeans.
  They also differ slightly in their fatty acid composition and taste. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
