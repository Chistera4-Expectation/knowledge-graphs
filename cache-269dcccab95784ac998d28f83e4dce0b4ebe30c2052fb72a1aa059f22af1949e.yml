text: No, the instances 'Lotus Leaf' and 'other leafy greens' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are leafy vegetables,
  they belong to different plant species and have distinct nutritional profiles. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the variety of edible vegetable options available.
