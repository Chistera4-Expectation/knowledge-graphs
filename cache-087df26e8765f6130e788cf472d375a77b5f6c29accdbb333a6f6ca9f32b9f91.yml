  The two instances, "Butter, melted" and "Cultured butter," are not identical in
  their composition, preparation method, or nutritional content. Melted butter is
  a liquid fat that has been heated to dissolve its solid particles, whereas cultured
  butter is made by introducing bacterial cultures to cream before churning it into
  butter. This process creates a distinct flavor profile and texture compared to regular
  butter. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic and ontological duplicates.'
