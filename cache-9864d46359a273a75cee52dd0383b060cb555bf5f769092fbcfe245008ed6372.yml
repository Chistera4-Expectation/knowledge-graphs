text: No, 'Eucalyptus Honey' and 'Orange Blossom Honey' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are types of honey, they have distinct
  flavor profiles and are derived from different floral sources (eucalyptus and orange
  blossom, respectively). They are unique products and should be treated as separate
  entities.
