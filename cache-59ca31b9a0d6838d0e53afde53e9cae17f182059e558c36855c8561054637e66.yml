text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates
  because they have different properties and uses in cooking. Ground white pepper
  is milder and has a more subtle flavor, while red pepper flakes are spicier and
  provide more heat. Although they both contribute to the seasoning of food, they
  have distinct characteristics and purposes in cooking.
