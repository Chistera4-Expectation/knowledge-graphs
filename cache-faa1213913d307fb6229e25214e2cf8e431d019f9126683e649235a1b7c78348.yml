text: No, 'Flavored Water' and 'Tap Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  characteristics. 'Flavored Water' is water with added flavors, while 'Tap Water'
  is water sourced from a public water supply. They serve different purposes and cater
  to different preferences.
