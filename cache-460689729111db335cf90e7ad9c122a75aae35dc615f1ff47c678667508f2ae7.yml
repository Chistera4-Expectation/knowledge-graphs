  While hemp seeds and sunflower seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles, appearances, tastes, textures, and uses. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates from a dietary
  perspective. Maintaining their separate identities allows for accurate tracking
  and comparison of their unique nutritional benefits, which can help individuals
  make informed choices about incorporating these seeds into their diets.'
