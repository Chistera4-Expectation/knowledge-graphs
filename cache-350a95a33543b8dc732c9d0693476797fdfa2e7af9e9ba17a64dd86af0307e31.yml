text: No, the instances 'habanero pepper' and 'other chili pepper' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the
  chili pepper family, they have distinct characteristics and properties that differentiate
  them from each other. Habanero peppers are known for their intense heat and fruity
  flavor, while other chili peppers may vary in heat level and flavor profile. Keeping
  them as separate instances allows for more accurate representation of their unique
  characteristics in the Edible Vegetable class.
