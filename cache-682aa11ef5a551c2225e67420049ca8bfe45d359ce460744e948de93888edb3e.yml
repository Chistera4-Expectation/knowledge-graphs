text: No, Glutinous Rice and Red Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics,
  nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking. Glutinous Rice is a type of short-grain
  rice that is high in starch and has a sticky texture when cooked, while Red Rice
  is a type of rice that is typically colored reddish-brown due to its anthocyanin
  content and has a nutty flavor and slightly chewy texture.
