text: No, Red Rice and Wild Rice should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of rice, they are different in terms of their botanical
  origins, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Red Rice is a variety of rice
  with a reddish hue, while Wild Rice is a separate species of grass that produces
  edible grains and is not a true rice species. They should be treated as separate
  entities in a rice classification system.
