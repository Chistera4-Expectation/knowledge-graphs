text: No, Castor Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetal oils, they have
  different properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Castor oil is derived from
  the seeds of the castor oil plant, while wheat germ oil comes from the germ of the
  wheat kernel. Castor oil is often used for industrial purposes and in traditional
  medicine, while wheat germ oil is primarily used for its high vitamin E content
  and as a dietary supplement.
