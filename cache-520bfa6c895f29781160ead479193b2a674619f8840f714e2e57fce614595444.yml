text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Ostrich Meat" and "Ostrich
  Soup" are derived from ostriches, they are different types of food products. Ostrich
  meat refers to the flesh of the bird, which can be prepared in various ways, such
  as grilling or roasting. On the other hand, ostrich soup is a specific dish made
  by cooking ostrich meat in a liquid with various ingredients like vegetables, spices,
  and broth. They are related but distinct food items.
