  The two teas have different ingredients and flavors, so they shouldn''t be considered
  duplicates. Berry Bliss Tea contains a blend of blackberry, raspberry, blueberry,
  and strawberry, while Chai Tea is made with black tea, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom,
  cloves, and star anise. Even though both teas may share some similarities in terms
  of their warm and comforting nature, they are distinct products with unique characteristics
  that set them apart from one another. Therefore, it''s not appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
