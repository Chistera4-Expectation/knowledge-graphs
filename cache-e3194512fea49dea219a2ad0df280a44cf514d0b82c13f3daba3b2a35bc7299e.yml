text: ' "Edible Seaweed Extract" or simply "Seaweed Extract" would be an appropriate
  class name. This is because the term "Plankton Extract" is not specific enough to
  accurately describe the food item, as plankton includes various organisms that are
  not edible. Additionally, the word "extract" implies that it is derived from a substance
  and is often used in reference to nutrient-rich concentrates. However, if the extract
  specifically comes from edible plankton such as certain types of seaweed, then this
  name would suffice.'
