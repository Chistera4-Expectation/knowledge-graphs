text: As a dietician, I can provide my professional opinion on the matter. From a
  nutritional and health perspective, hydrogen water and tap water are not semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are sources of water, hydrogen water is
  infused with additional hydrogen molecules, which could potentially have different
  health benefits or effects. Therefore, I would recommend not merging these instances.
  However, the final decision should be made by the appropriate domain experts or
  the developers of the classification system.
