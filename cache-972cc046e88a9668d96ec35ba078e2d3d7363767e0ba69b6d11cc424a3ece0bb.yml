text: No, Arborio Rice and Brown Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have different properties,
  uses, and nutritional values. Arborio Rice is a medium-grain rice used primarily
  for risotto, while Brown Rice is a whole grain rice with a nutty flavor and higher
  nutritional value compared to white rice.
