  While both Sage honey and Tupelo honey are types of honey, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they come from different plant sources. Sage honey
  is made by bees that gather nectar primarily from the flowers of the common sage
  (Salvia officinalis) plant, while Tupelo honey comes from bees that collect nectar
  from the blossoms of the tupelo tree (Nyssa spp.). These two honeys have distinct
  flavors, textures, and properties due to their unique botanical origins. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
