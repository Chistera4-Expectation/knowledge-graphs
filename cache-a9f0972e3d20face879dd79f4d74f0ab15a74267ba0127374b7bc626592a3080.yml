  While both "Chicken Curry" and "Fried Chicken" are poultry-derived foods that feature
  chicken as their primary ingredient, they have distinct preparation methods and
  flavor profiles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Keeping these items separate allows for more accurate
  categorization and differentiation based on nutritional content, cooking techniques,
  cultural origins, and other relevant factors.'
