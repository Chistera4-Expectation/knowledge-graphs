  While both "chicken soup" and "rotisserie chicken" are poultry-derived foods, they
  have different culinary preparations and uses, making them distinct food items.
  Chicken soup is typically a liquid dish that includes broth, vegetables, and cooked
  pieces of chicken, while rotisserie chicken refers to a whole chicken that has been
  seasoned and slow-roasted on a spit. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
