text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both are types of butter, they have different ingredients, nutritional profiles,
  and production methods. Grass-fed butter is made from the milk of grass-fed cows,
  while plant-based butter is made from plant-based ingredients like vegetable oils.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between the two.
