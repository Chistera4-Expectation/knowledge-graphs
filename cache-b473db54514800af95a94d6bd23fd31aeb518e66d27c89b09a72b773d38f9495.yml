  While balsamic vinegar and rice vinegar may have some similarities as types of vinegars
  used for flavoring food, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They differ
  in taste, origin, production process, and traditional uses, making them distinct
  ingredients with unique culinary applications. Therefore, it is essential to maintain
  separate entries for each type of vinegar in a Food Seasoning class or any other
  relevant contexts.'
