  While both Chicken curry and Turkey are types of poultry meat, they cannot be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer to different dishes with
  distinct characteristics. Although turkey can resemble chicken in some recipes,
  "turkey like chicken" does not mean that it is identical to chicken in all aspects.
  Each dish has its unique flavor profile, nutritional content, cooking methods, cultural
  associations, and other specific attributes which warrant them being separate entities
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.'
