text: ' No. Safflower oil and sesame oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils. They come
  from different plants, have distinct nutritional profiles, and are used for various
  culinary purposes. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate entries
  within the Edible Vegetal Oil class.'
