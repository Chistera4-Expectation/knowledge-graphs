text: No, 'Brown rice syrup' and 'Maple syrup' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates because they are different types of sweeteners with distinct
  nutritional profiles and sources. Brown rice syrup is derived from brown rice, while
  maple syrup comes from the sap of maple trees. They have different tastes, textures,
  and nutritional values.
