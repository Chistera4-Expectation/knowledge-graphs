text: 'No, the instances ''Ostrich Stock'' and ''Ostrich Wings'' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of ostrich-derived
  food products: ''Ostrich Stock'' is a liquid ingredient made by simmering ostrich
  bones or meat, while ''Ostrich Wings'' are a cut of meat from the ostrich that can
  be cooked and consumed. Although they both come from ostriches, they have distinct
  culinary uses and properties.'
