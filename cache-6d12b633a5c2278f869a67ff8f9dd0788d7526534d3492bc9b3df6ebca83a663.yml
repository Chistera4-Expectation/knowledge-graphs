text: ' No. While both "Fruits" and "Jackfruit" are related to each other (since Jackfruit
  is a type of fruit), they do not represent duplicate concepts from a semantic and
  ontological standpoint. "Fruits" refers to a broad category of edible plant products,
  while "Jackfruit" denotes a specific variety of tree-borne fruit with unique characteristics.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances into one.'
