  While both corned beef and grain-finished beef are types of beef, they refer to
  different processes and products. Corned beef is a type of preserved beef that has
  been salt-cured, while grain-finished beef refers to cattle that have been fed grains
  during the finishing phase of their lives to produce a specific flavor and marbling
  in the meat. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
