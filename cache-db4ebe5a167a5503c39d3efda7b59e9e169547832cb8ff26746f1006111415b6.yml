text: No, Hazelnut Oil and Walnut Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils derived from nuts, they have
  distinct flavors, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking and cuisine. Merging
  them would not accurately represent their individual properties and applications.
