text: No, Jasmine Rice and Sticky Rice should not be merged as they are different
  types of rice with distinct characteristics, uses, and origins. Jasmine Rice is
  a long-grain rice variety from Thailand, while Sticky Rice, also known as glutinous
  rice, is a short-grain variety used in various Southeast Asian cuisines for its
  unique texture. Although both are types of rice, they serve different purposes and
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
