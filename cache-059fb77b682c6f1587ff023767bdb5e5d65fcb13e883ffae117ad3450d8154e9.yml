text: No, the instances 'Beef shank' and 'Ground beef' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from beef, they represent
  different cuts and forms of beef, which have different nutritional values, culinary
  uses, and preparation methods. Merging them would result in a loss of specificity
  and accuracy in describing the respective food items.
