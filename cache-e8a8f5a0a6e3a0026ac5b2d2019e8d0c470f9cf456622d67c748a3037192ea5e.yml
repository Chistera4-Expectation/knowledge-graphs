  Although "Italian Dressing" and "Sesame Ginger Dressing" could both be categorized
  under the broader concept of "Salad Dressings," they are not semantic nor ontological
  duplicates. They have distinct ingredients and flavors, making them unique entities
  within the domain of food dressings. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two instances.'
