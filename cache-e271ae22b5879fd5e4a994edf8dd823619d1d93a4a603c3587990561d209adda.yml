text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both "Chicken Nuggets" and "Quail Nuggets" are poultry-derived food items,
  they are distinct in terms of the type of poultry used (chicken vs. quail) and may
  have different nutritional profiles, preparation methods, and flavor characteristics.
  Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
