text: No, Quail Broth and Quail Soup should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they share a common ingredient (quail), they are distinct food
  items with different preparation methods and textures. Broth typically refers to
  a liquid obtained by simmering ingredients, while soup refers to a mixture of solid
  and liquid ingredients, often with a thicker consistency than broth.
