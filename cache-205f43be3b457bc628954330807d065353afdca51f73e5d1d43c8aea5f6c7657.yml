text: No, 'Chicken Drumsticks' and 'Chicken Tenders' should not be merged together
  as they are distinct cuts of chicken with different characteristics, nutritional
  values, and cooking methods. While they both fall under the category of poultry-derived
  food, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
