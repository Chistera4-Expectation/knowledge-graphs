  While both chicken and turkey are types of poultry and can be used in similar dishes
  like salads, they have distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles that make
  them unique. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep ''Chicken salad'' and ''Turkey''
  as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class. This allows for more
  precise categorization and differentiation between various food items.'
