text: ' No. Mascarpone cheese and Swiss cheese are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. They belong to different categories of cheese with distinct
  characteristics, origins, and uses. Mascarpone is an Italian cream cheese typically
  used in desserts such as tiramisu, while Swiss cheese refers to various types of
  firm cheeses from Switzerland that have distinctive holes (eyes) and nutty flavors.
  Merging them would lead to confusion and loss of important information about each
  type of cheese.'
