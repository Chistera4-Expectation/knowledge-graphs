  While both fresh cilantro and fresh chili peppers are indeed edible vegetables,
  they belong to different botanical families and possess distinct flavors, appearances,
  and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Maintaining their individual identities supports more
  accurate culinary, nutritional, and agricultural discussions.'
