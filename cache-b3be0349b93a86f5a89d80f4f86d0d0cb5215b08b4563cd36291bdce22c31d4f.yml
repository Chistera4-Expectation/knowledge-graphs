text: No, "Forbidden Rice" and "Jasmine Rice" should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have distinct characteristics
  and uses. Forbidden Rice, also known as black rice, has a nutty flavor and is rich
  in antioxidants, while Jasmine Rice has a fragrant aroma and is commonly used in
  Thai and other Southeast Asian cuisines. These differences warrant separate instances
  in a rice classification system.
