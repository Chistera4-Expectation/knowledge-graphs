  While both "protein per serving" and "saturated fat per serving" provide information
  about the nutritional content of cheese, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates
  because they measure different aspects of nutrition. Protein is an essential macronutrient
  for building and repairing tissues, while saturated fat is a type of dietary fat
  that can contribute to heart disease when consumed in excess. Therefore, it is important
  to distinguish between these two properties when describing the nutritional value
  of cheese.'
