text: ' No. Corn husks and corn are not semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  they come from the same plant (corn), they serve different purposes and have different
  nutritional profiles. Corn is eaten as a grain or vegetable, while corn husks are
  typically used for wrapping food during cooking but are usually discarded before
  eating.'
