  Rotisserie chicken and turkey chili are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both are types of poultry-derived food, they refer to distinctly different
  dishes with unique ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. Rotisserie
  chicken is typically a whole cooked bird seasoned and roasted on a spit, while turkey
  chili is a stew made from ground or diced turkey meat combined with various vegetables,
  spices, and sometimes beans.'
