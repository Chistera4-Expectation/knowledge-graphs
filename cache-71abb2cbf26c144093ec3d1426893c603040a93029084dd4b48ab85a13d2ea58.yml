text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they both are types of sauces,
  they have distinct flavors, ingredients, and uses in cooking. Chili sauce typically
  has a spicy flavor and is used in various cuisines, while Teriyaki sauce has a sweet
  and savory flavor and is primarily used in Japanese cuisine. Merging them as duplicates
  would not accurately represent the differences between these two sauces.
