  Pumpkin seed oil and palm oil are not semantic or ontological duplicates, despite
  both being types of edible vegetable oils. They come from different plants (pumpkins
  vs. palm trees) and have distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, uses, and production
  methods. Therefore, they should remain separate entries within the Edible Vegetal
  Oil class.'
