  While both rice flour and white rice come from the same plant (Oryza sativa), they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different culinary
  uses and nutritional profiles.


  * White rice is a whole grain that has been milled to remove the bran and germ layers,
  resulting in a starchy product with a longer shelf life but reduced fiber, vitamin,
  and mineral content. It is typically boiled and served as a side dish or used in
  various dishes such as risottos, pilafs, and sushi rolls.

  * Rice flour is made by grinding raw or parboiled rice grains into a fine powder.
  Depending on the type of rice used (e.g., long-grain, short-grain, sweet) and whether
  it''s finely or coarsely ground, rice flour can exhibit varying textures and absorbency
  levels. This makes it suitable for gluten-free baking, thickening sauces, and making
  noodles like rice vermicelli.


  Therefore, I would recommend keeping these two concepts separate within your classification
  system since they serve distinct purposes in cooking and nutrition.'
