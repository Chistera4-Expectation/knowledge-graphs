text: ' No. Buckwheat honey and organic clover honey are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged together. While they may both fall under the
  category of "honey," they have distinct differences in terms of their taste, color,
  nutritional content, and plant sources. Therefore, it is important to maintain them
  as separate instances to accurately represent their unique characteristics.'
