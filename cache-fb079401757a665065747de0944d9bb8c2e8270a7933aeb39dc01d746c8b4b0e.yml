  While both bay leaves and Old Bay seasoning contain bay leaves as an ingredient,
  they are not interchangeable in all recipes. Bay leaves are a single ingredient
  that can be used in various dishes, while Old Bay seasoning is a blend of spices
  that includes bay leaves along with other herbs and spices like celery salt, black
  pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and paprika. The different proportions of each
  ingredient in Old Bay seasoning can also affect the flavor profile of a dish differently
  than using individual bay leaves. Therefore, it''s best to keep them separate rather
  than merging them as duplicates.'
