  While kiwi seeds and watermelon seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates in the context of a Dietician''s
  Edible Seeds class. It is important to maintain separate categories for each type
  of seed to accurately convey their distinct properties and benefits.'
