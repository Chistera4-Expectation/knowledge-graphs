  Brown rice is a type of whole grain rice that still has the bran layer intact, which
  provides it with more fiber and nutrients compared to white rice. Cooked rice, on
  the other hand, refers to any type of rice (including brown rice) that has been
  cooked and prepared for consumption. Therefore, while they are related concepts,
  "brown rice" and "cooked rice" cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates
  since they have different meanings and properties.'
