text: No, the instances 'Red Beans' and 'Steamed Broccoli' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible vegetables, they are
  distinctly different foods with different nutritional profiles. Red beans are a
  legume, while broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable. Merging them as duplicates would
  not accurately represent the variety of edible vegetables.
