  While both avocado oil and vegetable oil can be used for cooking and share some
  similarities, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Avocado oil is a
  specific type of edible oil that is extracted from avocados, while vegetable oil
  is a general term that refers to any oil derived from plants. Different types of
  vegetable oils include soybean oil, corn oil, olive oil, etc., but none of them
  have exactly the same nutritional profile or uses as avocado oil. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
