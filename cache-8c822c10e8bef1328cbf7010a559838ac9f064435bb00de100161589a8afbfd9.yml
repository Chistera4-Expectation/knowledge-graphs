text: No, the instances 'Chanterelle Mushroom' and 'Reishi Mushroom' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are two distinct species
  of mushrooms with different characteristics, properties, and uses. Chanterelle mushrooms
  are edible and have a fruity, peppery flavor, while reishi mushrooms are not typically
  consumed for their taste but are known for their medicinal properties.
