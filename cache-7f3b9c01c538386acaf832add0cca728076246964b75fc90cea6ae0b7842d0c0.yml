  Kombucha tea and matcha powder are two different types of tea with distinct differences
  in terms of their production processes, nutritional profiles, and flavors. Kombucha
  tea is a fermented tea drink made by adding a symbiotic culture of bacteria and
  yeast to sweetened black or green tea, while matcha powder is made from ground green
  tea leaves and does not undergo fermentation. Therefore, they should not be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
