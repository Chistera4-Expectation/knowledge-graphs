text: No, "Duck Patties" and "Duck Soup" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both are derived from ducks, they are different
  food items with distinct preparation methods and uses in culinary contexts. Merging
  them would lead to loss of specificity in describing these food items.
