  While both cantaloupe seeds and fenugreek seeds come from plants and can be eaten,
  they have different nutritional profiles, uses, and culinary applications. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  It is important to maintain separate listings for each type of seed to ensure accurate
  information about their unique properties and benefits.'
