text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of food derived from
  guinea fowl. Guinea Fowl Broth is a liquid dish made by simmering guinea fowl meat
  and bones in water, while Guinea Fowl Patties are a solid dish made by shaping ground
  guinea fowl meat into small, flat cakes before cooking. They may share a common
  ingredient (guinea fowl), but their preparation, texture, and nutritional content
  are distinct.
