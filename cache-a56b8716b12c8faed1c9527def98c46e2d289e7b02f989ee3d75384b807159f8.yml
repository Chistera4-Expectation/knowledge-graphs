text: No, Almond Oil and Safflower Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Almond Oil is derived from almonds and has a mild,
  nutty flavor, while Safflower Oil comes from safflower seeds and is known for its
  high smoke point and light, neutral taste. These differences make them unique and
  valuable in different culinary and dietary applications.
