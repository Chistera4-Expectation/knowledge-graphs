text: ' The most appropriate category for ''Beverages'' would be ''Edible Vegetal
  Oil'' as it is the closest option to liquid drinks. However, it is important to
  note that this may not be the perfect fit since other options such as ''Milk'',
  ''Yogurt'', and ''Juices from Edible Fruits'' could also be considered beverages.'
