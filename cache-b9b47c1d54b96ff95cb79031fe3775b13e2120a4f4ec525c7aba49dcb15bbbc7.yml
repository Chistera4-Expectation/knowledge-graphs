text: No, the instances 'Turkey Gravy' and 'Turkey' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from turkey,
  they are different food items with distinct nutritional profiles and properties.
  'Turkey' is a lean, protein-rich meat, while 'Turkey Gravy' is a sauce made from
  the drippings of cooked turkey, often containing additional ingredients like flour,
  butter, and spices, and is higher in fat and carbohydrates.
