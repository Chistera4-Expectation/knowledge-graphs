  While both dishes may contain chicken, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they represent different culinary preparations with distinct ingredients
  and flavors. Chicken parmesan is typically made by breading and frying chicken before
  topping it with tomato sauce and melted cheese, while chicken salad usually consists
  of cooked chicken combined with various vegetables, seasonings, and dressings. Merging
  these two instances would disregard their unique characteristics and uses in meal
  planning and preparation.'
