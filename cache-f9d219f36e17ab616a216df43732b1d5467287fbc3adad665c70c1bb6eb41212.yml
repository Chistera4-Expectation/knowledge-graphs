text: ' No. Fireweed honey and Tupelo honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. Although they both fall under the category of
  "honey," they come from different plant sources and therefore have distinct characteristics
  such as flavor, color, and nutritional content. Fireweed honey is made from the
  nectar of fireweed flowers (Chamaenerion angustifolium), while Tupelo honey comes
  from the tupelo tree (Nyssa spp.). These differences make them unique types of honey
  that do not qualify as duplicates.'
