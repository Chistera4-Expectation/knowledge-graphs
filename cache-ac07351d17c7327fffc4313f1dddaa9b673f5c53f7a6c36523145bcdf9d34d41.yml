text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are food seasonings, they
  have different purposes, ingredients, and effects on the dishes they are used in.
  Baking powder is a leavening agent used in baking, while curry powder is a blend
  of spices used in various dishes, particularly those with South Asian flavors. Merging
  them would not accurately represent their distinct uses and properties.
