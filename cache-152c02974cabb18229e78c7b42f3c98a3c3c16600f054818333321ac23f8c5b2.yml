  While both Adobo seasoning and Seasoning cubes may serve similar purposes (i.e.,
  adding flavor to food), they have distinct differences in terms of their composition
  and usage. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.


  Adobo seasoning is typically made from a blend of spices such as garlic powder,
  onion powder, oregano, turmeric, paprika, and black pepper, among others. It can
  be used as a dry rub for meats or mixed with liquids like oil or vinegar to make
  marinades and sauces. On the other hand, Seasoning cubes are concentrated bouillon-like
  products that usually contain salt, MSG, sugar, and various dehydrated vegetables
  and meat extracts. They dissolve easily when added to hot water or cooking liquid,
  providing a savory base for soups, stews, and rice dishes.


  Since these two food items possess different ingredients, preparation methods, and
  applications, maintaining separate categories for them ensures clearer communication,
  better organization, and more accurate information within the context of a Food
  Seasoning class.'
