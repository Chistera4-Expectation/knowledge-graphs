  Although both "Italian Seasoning" and "Jamaican Jerk Seasoning" are types of seasonings
  used in cooking, they contain different ingredients and impart unique flavors to
  dishes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological
  duplicates from a culinary perspective. They each have distinct properties that
  make them suitable for specific cuisines and recipes.'
