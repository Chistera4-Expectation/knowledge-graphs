text: No, the instances 'Cuban bread' and 'Whole Wheat Bread' should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of bread, they are
  distinct in terms of their ingredients, nutritional content, and preparation methods.
  Merging them would result in loss of valuable information and specificity for each
  type of bread.
