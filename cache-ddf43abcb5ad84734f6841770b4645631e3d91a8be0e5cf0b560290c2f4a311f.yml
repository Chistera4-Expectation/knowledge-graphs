text: ' No. Total fat and trans fat are not semantic or ontological duplicates, even
  though they both describe types of fats found in cheese servings. They have different
  meanings and play distinct roles in nutrition and health evaluation. Therefore,
  it is essential to keep them separate when providing nutritional information about
  cheeses.


  Total fat represents the overall amount of lipids (fats) present in a single serving,
  which includes saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fats. Understanding
  total fat content helps consumers assess their daily calorie intake from fats and
  maintain a balanced diet.


  On the other hand, trans fat refers specifically to unsaturated fats with at least
  one double bond arranged in a particular configuration called "trans" geometry.
  Trans fats are often formed through industrial processes like partial hydrogenation
  of vegetable oils, although small amounts can also occur naturally in some animal
  products. Numerous studies link high consumption of trans fats to increased risks
  of heart disease and various negative health outcomes; thus, monitoring trans fat
  intake is crucial for maintaining good cardiovascular health.


  Merging these two attributes would lead to confusion and misinformation regarding
  the actual nutritional value of specific cheese varieties. By keeping them separate,
  you ensure that people receive accurate and helpful data when making informed decisions
  about their food choices.'
