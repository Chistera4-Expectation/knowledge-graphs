text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food items. Ostrich meatballs are a specific dish made from ground ostrich meat,
  while ostrich stock is a liquid cooking ingredient made by simmering ostrich bones,
  vegetables, and other flavorings. Although both are derived from ostriches, they
  serve different purposes in cooking and should be kept as separate instances in
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
