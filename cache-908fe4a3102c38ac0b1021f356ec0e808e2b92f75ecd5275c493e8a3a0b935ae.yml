text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'Boneless chicken' and
  'Chicken Meatballs' are derived from chicken, they are different food products with
  distinct preparation methods and uses. 'Boneless chicken' typically refers to a
  cut of chicken without bones, while 'Chicken Meatballs' are made from ground chicken
  and formed into balls, often with additional ingredients and seasonings. These differences
  warrant separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
