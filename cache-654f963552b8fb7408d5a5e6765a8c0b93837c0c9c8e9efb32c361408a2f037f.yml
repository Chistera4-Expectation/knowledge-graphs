  The two instances, "Fresh guava slices" and "Guava paste," are not identical in
  their preparation methods, texture, and nutritional content, making them different
  entities. While they share some similarities, such as being derived from guavas,
  they have distinct characteristics that set them apart. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to keep them separate rather than merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
