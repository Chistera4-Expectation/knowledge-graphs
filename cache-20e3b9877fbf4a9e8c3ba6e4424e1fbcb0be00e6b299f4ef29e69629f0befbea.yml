text: ' No. While "turkey" and "turkey slices" are related, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Turkey is a type of poultry, while turkey slices refer
  to thinly cut pieces of cooked turkey meat, which can come from any part of the
  bird. Therefore, they represent different concepts and should not be merged.'
