text: No, they should not be merged. Chili oil and cooking oil are different types
  of edible vegetable oils with distinct characteristics, flavors, and uses. Chili
  oil is typically infused with chili peppers, resulting in a spicy flavor, while
  cooking oil is a neutral-tasting oil used for various culinary purposes.
