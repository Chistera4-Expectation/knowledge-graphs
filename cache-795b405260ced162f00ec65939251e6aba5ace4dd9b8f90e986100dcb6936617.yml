text: No, Ostrich Broth and Ostrich Gravy should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from ostrich, they have
  distinct culinary uses and compositions. Broth is a liquid made by simmering ingredients,
  often including meat or bones, in water, while gravy is a thick sauce made from
  the juices of cooked meat or vegetables mixed with a thickening agent like flour
  or cornstarch.
