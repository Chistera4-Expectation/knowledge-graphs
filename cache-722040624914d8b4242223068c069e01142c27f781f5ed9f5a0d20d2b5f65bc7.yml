text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of bread with distinct
  characteristics and uses. Ciabatta Bread is a type of Italian bread, while Grilled
  Bread refers to a method of preparing bread by grilling it. Although they both fall
  under the category of bread, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
