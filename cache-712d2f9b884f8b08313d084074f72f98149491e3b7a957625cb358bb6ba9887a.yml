text: ' No, corn tortillas and cornstarch should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are derived from corn, they have different culinary uses
  and nutritional profiles. Corn tortillas are made from ground corn kernels that
  are mixed with water and often lime to create masa dough, which is then cooked into
  flat, round tortillas. They primarily serve as a base for various Mexican dishes
  such as tacos and enchiladas. On the other hand, cornstarch comes from the endosperm
  of corn kernels and is processed into a fine powder used mainly as a thickening
  agent in cooking and baking. It has minimal nutritional value compared to corn tortillas.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two entities as duplicates
  based on their distinct properties.'
