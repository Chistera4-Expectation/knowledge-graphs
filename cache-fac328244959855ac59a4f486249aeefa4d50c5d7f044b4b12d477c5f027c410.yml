  While both are derived from poultry (pheasants in this case), they are different
  types of food with different nutritional content and preparation methods. Pheasant
  Gizzards are a specific part of the pheasant, while Pheasant Soup is a dish made
  from various parts of the pheasant combined with other ingredients.
