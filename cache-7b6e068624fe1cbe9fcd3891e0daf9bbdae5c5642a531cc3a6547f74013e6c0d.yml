text: 'As a dietician, my answer would be: No, they should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both ''Flavored Butter'' and ''Spreadable Butter''
  are types of butter, they have distinct differences in terms of their composition
  and usage. Flavored butter typically contains additional ingredients that enhance
  its taste, while spreadable butter is designed to be easily spreadable at room temperature.
  These differences should be preserved in a classification system.'
