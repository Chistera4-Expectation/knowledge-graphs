text: "Sure, here is an example of an instances list for a class Butter with concise\
  \ names:\n\n```python\nclass Butter:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n     \
  \   self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\nbutter_instances = [\n    Butter(\"\
  Peter\", 20),\n    Butter(\"Mary\", 30),\n    Butter(\"John\", 10),\n]\n```\n\n\
  This code defines a class called Butter with two attributes: name and age. It then\
  \ creates a list called butter_instances and instantiates three Butter objects with\
  \ different names and ages.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the code:\n\n```python\nclass\
  \ Butter:\n```\n\nThis line defines the Butter class.\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self,\
  \ name, age):\n```\n\nThis line defines the constructor method for the Butter class.\
  \ It takes two arguments: name and age, and initializes the attributes of the object\
  \ with the same names.\n\n```python\nbutter_instances = [\n    Butter(\"Peter\"\
  , 20),\n    Butter(\"Mary\", 30),\n    Butter(\"John\", 10),\n]\n```\n\nThis line\
  \ creates a list called butter_instances and instantiates three Butter objects with\
  \ the following names and ages:\n\n* Peter: 20\n* Mary: 30\n* John: 10"
