text: No, 'Hard Water' and 'Rain Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates because they have distinct properties and characteristics.
  Hard Water contains high levels of dissolved minerals, while Rain Water is naturally
  soft and low in minerals. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences
  between these two types of water.
