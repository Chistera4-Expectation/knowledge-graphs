text: ' I''m sorry, Sago Worms are not a food item commonly associated with Honey.
  They are small, white, non-segmented worms that live in the soil and feed on decaying
  plant matter. Honey is a sweet substance produced by bees from nectar or sap of
  flowers. Therefore, there isn''t an appropriate concise class name that can include
  both Sago Worms and Honey as they belong to different food categories.'
