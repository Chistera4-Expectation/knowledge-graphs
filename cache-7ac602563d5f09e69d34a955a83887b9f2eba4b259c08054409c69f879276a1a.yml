text: No, Porcelain Crab and Snow Crab should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are edible crustaceans, they belong to different
  families and have distinct characteristics, such as size, habitat, and appearance.
  Merging them would not accurately represent their unique traits and classifications.
