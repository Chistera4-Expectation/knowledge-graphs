text: No, the instances 'Crayfish' and 'Shellfish' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Crayfish is a specific type of shellfish, but
  not all shellfish are crayfish. Shellfish is a broader term that includes various
  types of marine invertebrates like crustaceans (e.g., crayfish, shrimp, and crab),
  mollusks (e.g., clams, mussels, and oysters), and echinoderms (e.g., sea urchins).
