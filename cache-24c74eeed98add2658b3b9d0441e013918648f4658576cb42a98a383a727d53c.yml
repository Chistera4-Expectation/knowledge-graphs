text: ' No. Adobo seasoning and Cajun seasoning are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. While both are types of seasonings used
  to add flavor to food, they have distinct ingredients and uses. Adobo seasoning
  is commonly associated with Latin American cuisine and typically includes garlic
  powder, onion powder, oregano, turmeric, and paprika. On the other hand, Cajun seasoning
  originated from Louisiana and usually contains cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder,
  onion powder, black pepper, and white pepper. Therefore, it is important to keep
  them separate due to their unique characteristics and applications in cooking.'
