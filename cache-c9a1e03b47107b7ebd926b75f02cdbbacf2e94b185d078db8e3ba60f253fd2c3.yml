  The two instances, "Berry Bliss Tea" and "Herbal Tea," are not identical in terms
  of their ingredients, flavors, or potential health benefits. "Berry Bliss Tea" is
  a fruit-based tea that contains a blend of berries such as blueberries, raspberries,
  and blackberries, whereas "Herbal Tea" is a caffeine-free infusion made from herbs,
  flowers, roots, or fruits. Even though they both belong to the broader category
  of teas, they have distinct characteristics that set them apart. Therefore, it is
  not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
