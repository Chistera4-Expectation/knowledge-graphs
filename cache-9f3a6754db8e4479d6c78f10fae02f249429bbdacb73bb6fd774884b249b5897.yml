text: No, they should not be merged together. While both clam and clam juice are related
  to edible molluscs, they are different instances. Clam refers to the mollusc itself,
  while clam juice is a liquid derived from clams and is a separate food product.
  They serve different purposes and have distinct nutritional profiles.
