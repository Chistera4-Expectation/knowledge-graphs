text: No, Dijon mustard and mustard seeds should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are related, they have different properties and uses.
  Dijon mustard is a type of prepared mustard made from mustard seeds, vinegar, and
  other ingredients, while mustard seeds are the seeds of the mustard plant used as
  a spice or ingredient in various dishes. They serve different purposes in cooking
  and should be treated as distinct entities.
