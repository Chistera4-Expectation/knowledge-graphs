  While both "beef" and "corned beef" are types of meat, they refer to different products
  with distinct nutritional profiles due to their processing methods and ingredients.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates
  from a dietary perspective.


  Regular beef typically refers to muscle tissue from cattle that has been processed
  minimally, while corned beef undergoes additional curing, pickling, and preservation
  techniques using salt and other seasonings. These differences result in variations
  in nutrition facts such as sodium content between regular beef and corned beef.
  Keeping these terms separate allows for more accurate tracking and analysis of food
  intake and health outcomes.'
