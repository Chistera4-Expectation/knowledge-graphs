text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Quail Gizzards" and "Quail
  Nuggets" are poultry-derived foods, they are not duplicates. Quail Gizzards refer
  specifically to the gizzard organ of the quail, which is a muscle that grinds food
  in the digestive system. Quail Nuggets, on the other hand, can refer to various
  quail meat products, such as ground quail meat formed into bite-sized pieces. These
  two products have distinct characteristics and uses in cooking and should be treated
  as separate instances.
