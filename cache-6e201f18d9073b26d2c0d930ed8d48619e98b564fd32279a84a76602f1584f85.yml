text: No, the instances 'Pumpernickel Bread' and 'Rye Bread' should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of bread, they have
  distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. Pumpernickel bread is typically
  made with coarsely ground rye flour, giving it a dark color and a dense texture,
  while rye bread can be made with lighter rye flour and have a variety of textures.
  Merging them would result in a loss of information about these differences.
