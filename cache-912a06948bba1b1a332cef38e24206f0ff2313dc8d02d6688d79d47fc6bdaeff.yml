text: No, Chai Tea and Hibiscus Tea are not semantic or ontological duplicates. While
  they are both types of tea, they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and cultural
  origins. Chai Tea is a blend of black tea, spices, and milk, originating from India,
  while Hibiscus Tea is made from the dried flowers of the hibiscus plant and is often
  consumed in various parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
