  While both chicken and turkey are types of poultry and may have some similarities,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Chicken soup is a specific dish
  that is made with chicken as its main ingredient, while "turkey" refers to a different
  type of bird and a separate food category. Although turkey can also be prepared
  in various ways like chicken, it does not make them identical concepts. Therefore,
  these two instances should remain separate within the Poultry-derived Food class.'
