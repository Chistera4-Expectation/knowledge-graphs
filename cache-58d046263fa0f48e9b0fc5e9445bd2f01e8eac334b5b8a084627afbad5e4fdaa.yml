text: ' "Processed Meats" would be the most appropriate class for all three options
  you provided (beef, pork-derived food, and poultry-derived food) since processed
  meats can come from any of these sources. According to the American Institute for
  Cancer Research, processed meats include foods that are preserved by smoking, curing,
  or adding chemical preservatives and include items such as bacon, sausages, hot
  dogs, salami, corned beef, and beef jerky, regardless of whether they are derived
  from beef, pork, or poultry.'
