text: No, these instances should not be merged together as they represent different
  types of drinking water with distinct properties. Artisanal water typically refers
  to water sourced from a natural spring, while oxygenated water is infused with additional
  oxygen. These differences in source and processing make them separate entities in
  the context of drinking water.
