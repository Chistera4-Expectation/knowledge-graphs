text: No, Skyr Yogurt and Whole Milk Yogurt should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics,
  such as nutritional content, texture, and production methods, which make them different
  from each other. Merging them together would not accurately represent these differences.
