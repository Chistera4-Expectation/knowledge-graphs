  Note: Panzanella salad is a traditional Italian salad made with bread, tomatoes,
  cucumber, and red onion, dressed with olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, salt,
  and black pepper. The bread is usually soaked in the dressing to soften, while the
  vegetables provide a fresh, crunchy contrast. Additional ingredients like basil,
  capers, or anchovies can be added for extra flavor.'
