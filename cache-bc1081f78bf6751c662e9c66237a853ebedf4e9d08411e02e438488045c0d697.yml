text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct characteristics. Freshly
  ground black pepper is a spice derived from the dried and ground fruit of the Piper
  nigrum plant, whereas red pepper flakes for heat consist of dried and crushed red
  chili peppers. Although they both serve as seasonings, they have different flavors,
  heat levels, and culinary uses.
