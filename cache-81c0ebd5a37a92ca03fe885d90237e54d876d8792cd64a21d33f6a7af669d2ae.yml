  While chili paste and garlic paste may both fall under the category of food seasonings,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantically, they have different
  meanings and uses in cooking. Chili paste is typically made from ground chilies,
  vinegar, and spices, while garlic paste is made from pureed garlic cloves. Ontologically,
  they belong to distinct categories of ingredients with unique properties and applications.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
