  While soybean oil and walnut oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, taste, smoke points,
  and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Instead, they should be treated as separate but related
  concepts within the category of edible vegetable oils.'
