  The term "bacon bits" refers to small pieces of cooked bacon, which is a type of
  cured meat. "Diced vegetables" refers to small pieces of various vegetables that
  have been cut into uniform cubes. "Vegetable shortening" is a type of fat used in
  cooking and baking, typically made from vegetable oils. These three terms are not
  semantically or ontologically related enough to be considered duplicates.'
