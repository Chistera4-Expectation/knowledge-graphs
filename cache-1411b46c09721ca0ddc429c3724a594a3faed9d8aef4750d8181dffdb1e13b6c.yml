text: ' Out of the given options, the most adequate class for "Black beans" would
  be "Edible Vegetables". Black beans are legumes and are often classified as vegetables
  in culinary contexts. However, it is important to note that botanically speaking,
  black beans are seeds, not vegetables. Nevertheless, since this question asks for
  a classification based on the provided options, I would still recommend choosing
  "Edible Vegetables."'
