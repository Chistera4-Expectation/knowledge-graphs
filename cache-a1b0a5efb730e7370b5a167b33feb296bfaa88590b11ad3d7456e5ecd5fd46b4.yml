text: "As a dietician, I would not give a definitive yes or no answer to this question,\
  \ as it involves specific classifications in the context of botanical taxonomy and\
  \ food science. Japonica rice and white rice are different varieties with distinct\
  \ characteristics. \n\nJaponica rice is a short-grain rice type, primarily grown\
  \ in Japan, Korea, and China. It has a sticky texture when cooked, making it suitable\
  \ for sushi and rice balls.\n\nWhite rice, on the other hand, refers to the milled\
  \ form of rice, where the outer layers (bran and germ) have been removed, leaving\
  \ only the starchy endosperm. It can include various rice types, including Japonica\
  \ rice, Indica rice, and others.\n\nWhile Japonica rice is a subtype of white rice,\
  \ they are not the same thing. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic\
  \ and ontologic duplicates. However, a more accurate classification system would\
  \ be helpful in distinguishing between different rice varieties and their specific\
  \ characteristics."
