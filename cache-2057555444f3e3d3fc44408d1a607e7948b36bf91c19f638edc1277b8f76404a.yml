text: No, Brown Rice and Japonica Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Brown Rice refers to a type of rice that has the outer layer
  of bran intact, while Japonica Rice is a specific variety of short-grain rice originating
  from Japan. Although they are both types of rice, they have distinct characteristics
  and properties that differentiate them from each other.
