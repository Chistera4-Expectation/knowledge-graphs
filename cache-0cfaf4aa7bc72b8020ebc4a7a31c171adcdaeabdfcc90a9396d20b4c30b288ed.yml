text: No, they should not be merged together. While they both fall under the category
  of food seasoning, they have distinct properties and uses in cooking. Bouillon powder
  is typically used as a flavor enhancer in soups, stews, and sauces, while garlic
  powder is a seasoning derived from garlic that adds a specific flavor profile to
  dishes. They are not duplicates as they serve different purposes in the culinary
  world.
