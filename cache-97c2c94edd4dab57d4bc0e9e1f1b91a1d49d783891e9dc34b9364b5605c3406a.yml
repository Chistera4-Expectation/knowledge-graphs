text: No, these two sauces are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. While both are
  types of sauces, they have distinct ingredients and flavor profiles. Mole sauce
  typically includes ingredients such as chili peppers, nuts, seeds, and spices, while
  Scotch bonnet pepper sauce primarily consists of Scotch bonnet peppers and other
  ingredients to create a hot and flavorful sauce.
