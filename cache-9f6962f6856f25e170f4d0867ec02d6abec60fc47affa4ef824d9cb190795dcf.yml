text: No, 'Oat Milk' and 'Soy Milk' should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the Milk class, they have different
  ingredients and nutritional profiles. Oat milk is made from oats, while soy milk
  is made from soybeans. They may share some similarities, but they are distinct products
  with their own unique characteristics.
