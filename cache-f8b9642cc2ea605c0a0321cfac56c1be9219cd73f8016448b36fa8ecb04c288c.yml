text: ' No. Jasmine rice and white rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they may have some similarities. While both are types of rice and share
  certain characteristics (such as being a source of carbohydrates), they differ in
  terms of taste, texture, nutritional content, cultivation methods, and cultural
  significance. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entries in
  a rice classification system.'
