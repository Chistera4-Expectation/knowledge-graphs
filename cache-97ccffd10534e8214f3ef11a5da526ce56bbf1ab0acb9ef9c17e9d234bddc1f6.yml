text: No, Quail Meat and Quail Wings should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from quails, they are different cuts
  of the bird and have distinct nutritional profiles. Merging them would result in
  a loss of specificity and could lead to inaccurate dietary information.
