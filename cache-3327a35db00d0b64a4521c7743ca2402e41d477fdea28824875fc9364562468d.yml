text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different types of juices
  with distinct properties and nutritional profiles. Key lime juice is a citrus fruit
  juice, while vegetable juice typically refers to juices made from vegetables like
  carrots, beets, or leafy greens. They serve different purposes in recipes and have
  different nutritional values.
