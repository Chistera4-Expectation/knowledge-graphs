text: ' Here are some possible instance variables for a `Tea` class in the context
  of a dietitian or nutritionist:


  1. calories: An integer representing the number of calories in one serving of tea.
  This could vary depending on whether milk, sugar, or other additives are included.

  2. caffeine\_content: A float representing the amount of caffeine in milligrams
  per serving. Different types of tea (e.g., black, green, herbal) have different
  amounts of caffeine.

  3. antioxidants: A boolean indicating whether the tea contains antioxidants and
  their quantity if known. Some teas, such as green tea, are high in antioxidants,
  which can help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.

  4. flavonoids: A float representing the concentration of flavonoids, a type of antioxidant
  found in tea. Flavonoid content varies depending on the type of tea and how it is
  brewed.

  5. polyphenols: A float representing the concentration of polyphenols, another type
  of antioxidant found in tea. Polyphenol content also varies depending on the type
  of tea and how it is brewed.

  6. L-theanine: A float representing the amount of L-theanine, an amino acid that
  occurs naturally in tea leaves. L-theanine has been shown to promote relaxation
  without drowsiness and may enhance focus and attention.

  7. servingsize: A string specifying the recommended serving size, such as "8 oz"
  or "1 cup." Serving sizes can vary based on cultural norms or personal preference.

  8. preparation\_instructions: A string providing instructions for preparing the
  tea, including water temperature and steeping time. Proper brewing techniques can
  maximize the health benefits of tea while minimizing bitterness and astringency.'
