  Although "Italian Dressing" and "Wasabi Dressing" may both fall under the general
  category of "Food Dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantically,
  each dressing has its own distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses. Ontologically,
  they represent separate entities with different characteristics and purposes within
  the culinary world. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them as separate instances
  in this context.'
