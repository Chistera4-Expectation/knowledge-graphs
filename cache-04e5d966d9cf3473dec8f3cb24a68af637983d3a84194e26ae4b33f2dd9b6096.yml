text: No, Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both varieties of Cheerios, they have
  distinct differences in terms of taste, ingredients, and nutritional content. They
  are separate products and should be treated as such in a classification system.
