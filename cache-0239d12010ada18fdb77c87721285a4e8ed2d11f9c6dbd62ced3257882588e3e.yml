text: As a dietician, my expertise is in nutrition, not ontology or semantics. However,
  from a food perspective, 'Scotch bonnet pepper sauce' and 'sour sauce' are not the
  same and should not be merged together. Scotch bonnet pepper sauce is a type of
  hot sauce made from Scotch bonnet peppers, while sour sauce typically refers to
  a condiment made from vinegar, sugar, and spices, resulting in a sour and sweet
  taste. These sauces have different flavors, ingredients, and uses, and should not
  be considered duplicates.
