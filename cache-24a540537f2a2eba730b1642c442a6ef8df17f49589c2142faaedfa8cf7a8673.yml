text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both "Pheasant Stock" and "Chicken/Vegetable Stock" are poultry-derived food
  items, they are not the same. Pheasant stock is derived from pheasant bones and
  vegetables, while chicken/vegetable stock is derived from chicken bones and vegetables.
  They have distinct ingredients and should be treated as separate instances.
