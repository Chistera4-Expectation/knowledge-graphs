text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Five-spice powder and Spices
  are related to seasoning, they are distinct concepts. Five-spice powder is a specific
  blend of spices, whereas Spices is a broader category that includes a wide variety
  of seasonings. Merging them together would result in a loss of specificity and potentially
  cause confusion.
