text: As a dietician, my expertise is in nutrition, not water classification. However,
  from a general perspective, 'Rain Water' and 'Well Water' can be considered different
  types of water sources, even though they are both naturally occurring. Therefore,
  merging them as semantic and ontologic duplicates would not be accurate since they
  have distinct characteristics and origins.
