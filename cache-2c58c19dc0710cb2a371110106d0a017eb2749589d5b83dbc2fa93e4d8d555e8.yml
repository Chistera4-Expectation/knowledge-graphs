text: No, King Crab and Mitten Crab should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the Edible Crustaceans class,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, habitats, and nutritional
  profiles. Merging them would lead to confusion and inaccurate information about
  each species.
