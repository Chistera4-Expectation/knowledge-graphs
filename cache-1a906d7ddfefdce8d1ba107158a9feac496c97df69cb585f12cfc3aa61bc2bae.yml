text: No, French Yogurt and Greek Yogurt should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics,
  such as taste, texture, and ingredients. Merging them would not accurately represent
  their differences and could lead to confusion for users.
