text: No, Artisanal Water and Mineral Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they may share some similarities, they are distinct
  types of water with different characteristics and production methods. Artisanal
  Water typically refers to water sourced from a specific location and may be bottled
  at the source, while Mineral Water is characterized by its naturally occurring minerals
  and can be sourced from various locations.
