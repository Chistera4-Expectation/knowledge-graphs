text: ' The most appropriate category for "stabilizers" would be "Food Additives".
  These substances are used to maintain the consistency or texture of food products
  and can fall into various categories such as sauces, dressings, seasonings, spices,
  and sweeteners. However, they do not fit neatly into any single one of these categories.
  It is important to note that stabilizers are often added in small amounts and may
  not always appear on ingredient lists. Examples include xanthan gum, carrageenan,
  guar gum, locust bean gum, pectin, and agar-agar. While some stabilizers have health
  benefits like thickening soups or preventing separation in salad dressings, others
  might raise concerns about their impact on digestion or allergenicity. As a dietician,
  it is crucial to help clients understand what ingredients are included in the foods
  they consume and make informed choices based on individual needs and preferences.'
