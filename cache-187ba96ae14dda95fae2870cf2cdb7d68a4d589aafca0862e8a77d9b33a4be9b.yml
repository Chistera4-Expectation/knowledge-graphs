text: 'No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both ''Ostrich Gravy'' and ''Ostrich Thighs'' are derived from ostriches,
  they are different types of food products: ''Ostrich Gravy'' is a sauce made from
  ostrich meat, whereas ''Ostrich Thighs'' are a cut of ostrich meat. They serve different
  purposes in recipes and have distinct nutritional values.'
