text: No, Black Rice and Red Rice should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they share the common characteristic of being whole grain rices
  with distinct colors, they have different nutritional profiles, flavors, and cultural
  significance. Maintaining them as separate instances allows for accurate representation
  of these differences in a dietary context.
