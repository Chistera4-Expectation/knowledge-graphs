text: Yes, they can be considered as semantic and ontological duplicates, as both
  instances refer to the same vegetable (tomato) but with different forms (slices
  vs. whole). However, in a classification system, it may be useful to distinguish
  between these two forms for specific purposes, such as recipe preparation or nutritional
  content. In such cases, they would not be considered exact duplicates but rather
  variations of the same vegetable.
