text: No, they should not be merged together. While both ostrich and turkey gizzards
  are poultry-derived foods, they come from different types of poultry and may have
  different nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and cultural significance. It is
  important to maintain separate instances for each in a comprehensive food ontology.
