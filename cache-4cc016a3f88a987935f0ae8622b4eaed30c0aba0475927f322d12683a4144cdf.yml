  While both chili oil and sesame oil are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. Chili oil
  is typically made from vegetable oil that has been infused with dried chilli flakes
  or crushed red pepper, resulting in an oil with a spicy flavor and aroma. Sesame
  oil, on the other hand, is made by pressing roasted sesame seeds to extract their
  natural oils, which results in an oil with a nutty, slightly sweet flavor. These
  two types of oils serve different purposes in cooking, so it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
