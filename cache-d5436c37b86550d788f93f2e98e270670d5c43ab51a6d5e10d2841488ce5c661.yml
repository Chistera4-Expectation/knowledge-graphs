text: " No.\n\nWhile both \"chicken breasts\" and \"fried chicken\" are types of poultry-derived\
  \ food, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. Chicken breasts refer\
  \ to a specific cut from a chicken that is typically prepared by grilling, baking,\
  \ or saut\xE9ing with minimal ingredients. On the other hand, fried chicken involves\
  \ breading and deep-frying the chicken pieces (not limited to just chicken breasts),\
  \ often including additional seasonings and flavorings. Therefore, these two instances\
  \ represent distinct categories within the poultry-derived food domain due to their\
  \ unique preparation methods and nutritional profiles."
