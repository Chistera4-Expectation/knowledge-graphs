text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different food products derived
  from the same animal source. "Pheasant Gravy" refers to a liquid sauce made from
  pheasant meat and other ingredients, while "Pheasant Meat" refers to the flesh of
  the pheasant bird itself. These two instances serve different purposes in a food
  classification system.
