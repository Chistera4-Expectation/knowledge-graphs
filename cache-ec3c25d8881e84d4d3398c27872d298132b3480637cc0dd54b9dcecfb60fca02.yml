  While both diced celery and diced onions are types of diced vegetables, they have
  different nutritional profiles, flavors, textures, and uses in recipes. Therefore,
  it is important to keep them separate for accurate labeling, meal planning, and
  recipe creation purposes. Merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates would
  not accurately reflect their unique properties and uses.'
