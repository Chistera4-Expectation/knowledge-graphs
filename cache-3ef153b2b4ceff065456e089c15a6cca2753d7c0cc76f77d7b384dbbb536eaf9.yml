text: No, these two instances should not be merged as they are not semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes are different forms of red chili
  peppers and have different uses in cooking. Cayenne pepper is a ground spice made
  from dried and ground cayenne peppers, while red pepper flakes are made from dried
  and crushed red chili peppers, which may include a mix of different varieties. While
  both add heat to dishes, their flavor profiles and textures are different, making
  them distinct in their culinary applications.
