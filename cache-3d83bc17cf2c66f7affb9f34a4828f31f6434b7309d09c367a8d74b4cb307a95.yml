text: No, they should not be merged. Distilled water and tap water have different
  properties and uses. Distilled water is water that has been boiled into vapor and
  condensed back into liquid in a separate container, leaving most impurities behind.
  Tap water is water that comes from a municipal water supply and may contain minerals,
  chemicals, and other impurities. Although both are forms of drinking water, they
  have distinct differences that warrant their separation as individual instances.
