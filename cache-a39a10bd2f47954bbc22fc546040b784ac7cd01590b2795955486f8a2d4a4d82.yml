text: No, "Green onions" and "Onion slices" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are derived from the same plant, green
  onions (scallions) and onion slices are different in terms of their stage of development
  and culinary use. Green onions are harvested when they are young and have a milder
  flavor compared to mature onions, while onion slices are made from mature onions,
  which have a stronger flavor. They are used in different ways and are not interchangeable
  in recipes.
