  While both cooked meat and meatballs are types of prepared beef, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they refer to distinct food items with different
  culinary preparations and uses. Cooked meat is simply beef that has been heated
  to a safe eating temperature, while meatballs are a specific dish made from ground
  beef (or other meats) mixed with various seasonings and formed into balls before
  being cooked. Therefore, these two terms should remain separate.'
