text: No, these instances should not be merged as they represent different types of
  vegetables. "Pickled vegetables" refers to vegetables that have been preserved in
  an acidic solution, while "other vegetables for variation" implies a broader category
  of vegetables that can be used to provide variety in a diet. Although they may overlap
  in certain contexts, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
