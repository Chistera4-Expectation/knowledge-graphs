  While both "chicken pieces" and "chicken salad" are poultry-derived foods, they
  cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they represent
  different culinary preparations of chicken with distinct nutritional profiles and
  uses in recipes. Chicken pieces generally refer to raw or cooked cuts of meat from
  various parts of a chicken (e.g., breasts, thighs, wings), while chicken salad is
  a dish made using cooked chicken, mixed with ingredients like mayonnaise, vegetables,
  herbs, or spices, often served cold. Merging them would not accurately reflect their
  unique meanings and applications within the domain of food and nutrition.'
