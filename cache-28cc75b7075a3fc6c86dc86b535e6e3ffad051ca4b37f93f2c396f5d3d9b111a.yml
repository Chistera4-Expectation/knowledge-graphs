text: No, they should not be merged together. While both cashew milk and nut milk
  are types of plant-based milk, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Cashew milk is specifically made from cashews, while nut milk can refer to any plant-based
  milk made from nuts (e.g., almond milk, hazelnut milk, etc.). Therefore, they should
  be treated as separate instances in the Milk class.
