text: ' No. Fireweed honey and strawberry honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  despite both being types of honey. They come from different plant sources (fireweed
  vs strawberries) which can affect their taste, color, and other properties. Therefore,
  they should remain separate instances.'
