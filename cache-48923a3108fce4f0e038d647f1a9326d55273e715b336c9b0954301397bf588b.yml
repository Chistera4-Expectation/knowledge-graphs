  While both "Fish sauce" and "Sauce" may belong to the same general category of food
  items (i.e., sauces), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. "Fish sauce"
  is a specific type of sauce made from fermented fish, while "sauce" is a broader
  term that encompasses many different types of liquid condiments used for flavoring
  or enhancing foods. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  together.'
