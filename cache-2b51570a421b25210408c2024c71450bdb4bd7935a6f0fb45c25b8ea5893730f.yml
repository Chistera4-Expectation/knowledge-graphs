  Chili bean paste and pepper to taste are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They refer to different ingredients with distinct flavors, textures, and uses in
  cooking. Chili bean paste is typically a thick, spicy-sweet paste made from fermented
  beans, chilies, and various seasonings, while "pepper to taste" generally means
  adding ground black pepper or another type of pepper (such as white, green, or cayenne)
  according to personal preference for added heat and flavor.'
