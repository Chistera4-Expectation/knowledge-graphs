text: ' No. Cornmeal and oatmeal are not semantic and ontological duplicates, and
  they should not be merged together as the same thing in a breakfast cereal class.
  Although both cornmeal and oatmeal can be consumed at breakfast time and prepared
  in similar ways (e.g., cooked with milk), they come from different types of grains
  and have distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is important to keep them
  separate within a breakfast cereal class for accuracy and clarity.'
