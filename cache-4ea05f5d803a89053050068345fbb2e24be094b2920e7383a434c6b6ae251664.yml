  While both "Chicken Curry" and "Rotisserie Chicken" are poultry-derived foods, they
  cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they represent
  distinct types of dishes with different preparation methods and uses.


  1. Preparation Methods: Rotisserie chickens are typically seasoned whole chickens
  that are cooked on a rotating spit over an open flame or heat source. On the other
  hand, Chicken Curry is prepared by cooking diced or shredded chicken pieces in a
  sauce made from various ingredients such as garlic, ginger, onions, tomatoes, chilies,
  and aromatic spices like turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The two dishes
  have unique culinary techniques associated with them.

  2. Flavor Profiles & Uses: Rotisserie chickens offer a simple yet flavorful dish,
  perfect for meal prepping, sandwiches, salads, or simply enjoying with side dishes.
  In contrast, Chicken Curry has a complex flavor profile due to its richly spiced
  sauce and can be served with rice, flatbread, or vegetables, making it more versatile
  depending upon regional variations. Merging these terms would not accurately reflect
  their differences and could lead to confusion regarding their respective meanings.'
