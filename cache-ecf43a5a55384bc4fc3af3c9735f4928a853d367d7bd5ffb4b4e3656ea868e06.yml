text: ' No. Tamarind paste and pepper to taste are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They serve different purposes in cooking and impart unique flavors to dishes. Tamarind
  paste is a sour-sweet ingredient made from tamarind fruit pulp, while "pepper to
  taste" refers to adding ground or whole pepper according to personal preference
  for heat and flavor.'
