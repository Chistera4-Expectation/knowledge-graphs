text: No, they should not be merged as they are different food products made from
  ostrich meat. Ostrich sausage is a processed meat product made from ground ostrich
  meat, while ostrich wings are a cut of meat taken from the bird's wing. Although
  both are derived from ostriches, they are distinct food items with different culinary
  uses and nutritional profiles.
