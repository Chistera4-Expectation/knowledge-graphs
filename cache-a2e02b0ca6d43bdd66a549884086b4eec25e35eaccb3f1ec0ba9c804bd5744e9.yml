text: No, the instances 'Optional additions' and 'Optional toppings' should not be
  merged together. Although they may have some overlap, they represent different aspects
  of food seasoning. 'Optional additions' typically refer to ingredients mixed into
  the dish, while 'Optional toppings' refer to ingredients placed on top of the dish.
  They are distinct concepts that should be kept separate.
