  While both chicken breasts and chicken soup are made from chickens and share certain
  nutritional properties, they have distinct culinary uses and nutrient profiles.
  Chicken breasts are typically considered a lean source of protein, while chicken
  soup can vary widely in its ingredients and nutritional content depending on the
  recipe. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
