text: ' The most adequate class for "Long grain white rice" would be "Grains." However,
  since "Grains" is not an option in the list provided, I would suggest "Rice" as
  the next best choice. This category includes different types of rice and allows
  for better classification than some other options such as "Food Dressing," "Food
  Seasoning," or "Sweetener."'
