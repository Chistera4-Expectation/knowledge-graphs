text: ' No. Dark soy sauce and fish sauce are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they may both be types of sauces used in cooking, they have different ingredients,
  flavors, and uses in recipes. Dark soy sauce is made from fermented soybeans and
  wheat, while fish sauce is made from fermented fish. They also differ in taste,
  with dark soy sauce having a sweet and salty flavor, whereas fish sauce has a strong
  umami taste. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
