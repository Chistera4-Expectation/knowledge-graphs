text: ' No. Although tuvar dal (pigeon peas) and urad dal (black gram) are both types
  of pulses, they have distinct nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and cultural
  significance. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Keeping these terms separate allows for more precise communication about
  each specific type of legume and its unique characteristics.'
