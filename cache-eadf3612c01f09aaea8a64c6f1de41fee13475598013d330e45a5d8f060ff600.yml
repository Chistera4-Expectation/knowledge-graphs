text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of poultry-derived
  food. Chicken Meatballs are a specific dish made from ground chicken, while Guinea
  Fowl Meat refers to the meat derived from guinea fowl birds. Although they both
  fall under the category of poultry-derived food, they have distinct characteristics
  and uses.
