text: No, Camel Milk and Oat Milk should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of milk with different nutritional profiles and origins. Camel Milk is an
  animal-based milk, while Oat Milk is a plant-based milk alternative. They serve
  different dietary needs and preferences and should remain separate instances in
  the Milk class.
