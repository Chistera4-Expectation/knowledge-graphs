text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food products. Guinea Fowl Gizzards refer to the gizzards of the bird, which are
  a muscle used for grinding food, while Guinea Fowl Sausage refers to a processed
  meat product made from ground guinea fowl meat. These two items have different nutritional
  compositions and cooking methods, making them distinct entities in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
