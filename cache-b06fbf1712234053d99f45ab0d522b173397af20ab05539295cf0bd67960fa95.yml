text: ' No. Corn husks and corn are not duplicate instances. While they both come
  from the same plant, they have different culinary uses and nutritional profiles.
  Corn is a grain that can be consumed whole, ground into flour, or used in various
  dishes, while corn husks are typically discarded before cooking and are not considered
  a food source. They serve different purposes and therefore should not be merged
  as duplicates.'
