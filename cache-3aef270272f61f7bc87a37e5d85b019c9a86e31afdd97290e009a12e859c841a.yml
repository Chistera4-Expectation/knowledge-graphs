  While pork belly and pork spareribs are both cuts of pork and share some similarities,
  they have distinct differences in terms of their culinary uses, nutritional profiles,
  and anatomical locations on the pig. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them
  as semantic or ontological duplicates. Here are some reasons why:


  1. Anatomical location: Pork belly comes from the underside or belly portion of
  the pig, while pork spareribs come from the ribcage area near the loin. These two
  cuts have different textures, flavors, and fat contents due to their unique locations
  on the animal.

  2. Culinary use: Pork belly is often cured, smoked, or slow-cooked to create dishes
  like bacon, pancetta, or braised pork belly. On the other hand, pork spareribs are
  typically grilled, barbecued, or slow-cooked with seasonings to make dishes such
  as baby back ribs or St. Louis-style ribs. The cooking methods and applications
  for these two cuts vary significantly.

  3. Nutritional profile: Although both pork belly and pork spareribs contain protein,
  fat, and various vitamins and minerals, their specific nutrient compositions differ.
  For instance, pork belly tends to have a higher fat content than pork spareribs.
  Merging the two would result in loss of information about these important distinctions.

  4. Cultural significance: Both pork belly and pork spareribs hold cultural importance
  in various cuisines worldwide. By merging the two, we risk losing valuable context
  regarding regional food traditions and preparation techniques.


  In summary, pork belly and pork spareribs are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  given their distinct anatomical origins, culinary applications, nutritional properties,
  and cultural roles.'
