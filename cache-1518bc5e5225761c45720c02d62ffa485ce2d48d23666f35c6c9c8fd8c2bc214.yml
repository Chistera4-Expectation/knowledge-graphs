text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from poultry
  (pheasant), they are different food items with different preparation methods and
  uses. Pheasant nuggets are likely breaded and deep-fried, while pheasant soup is
  a liquid-based dish with various ingredients. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the distinct foods within the Poultry-derived Food class.
