  While both "herb butter" and "whipped butter" are types of butter, they have different
  characteristics and uses in cooking. Herb butter is made by blending softened butter
  with fresh herbs such as parsley, basil, or chives, giving it a distinct flavor
  and aroma. Whipped butter, on the other hand, is made by whipping air into softened
  butter to increase its volume and create a light, fluffy texture. It is often used
  as a spread or in baking recipes.


  Therefore, from a culinary perspective, it makes sense to keep them separate as
  distinct entities rather than merging them as duplicates.'
