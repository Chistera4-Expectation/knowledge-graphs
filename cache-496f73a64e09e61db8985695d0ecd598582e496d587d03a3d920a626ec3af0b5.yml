text: 'As a dietician, I can provide insight into the nutritional aspect of water.
  From a dietary perspective, purified water and regular water are essentially the
  same. Both provide hydration and are essential for maintaining proper bodily functions.
  However, in terms of semantics and ontology, the distinction between the two might
  be based on their production methods and perceived quality, which could be important
  for other applications such as environmental or chemical studies.


  In summary, while there may be some overlapping characteristics between purified
  water and regular water, they may not be considered exact duplicates due to the
  differences in their production methods and possible implications in various fields.'
