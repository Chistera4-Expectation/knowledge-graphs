  While both "Browned butter" and "Herb butter" are types of butter, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their flavor profiles and uses in cooking. Browned butter
  has a rich, nutty flavor and is often used as a finishing sauce or in baked goods,
  while herb butter is made with softened butter mixed with fresh herbs like parsley,
  chives, or thyme, and is often used to add flavor to grilled meats, fish, or vegetables.
  They can be considered as two different entities in the Butter class.'
