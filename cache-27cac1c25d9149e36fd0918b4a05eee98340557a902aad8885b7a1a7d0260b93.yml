text: No, ground beef and beef patties should not be merged together as they have
  distinct differences in their preparation and use. Ground beef is a raw, unformed
  mixture of beef trimmings while beef patties are formed patties of ground beef,
  often used for hamburgers. They may have similar nutritional values, but they are
  not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
