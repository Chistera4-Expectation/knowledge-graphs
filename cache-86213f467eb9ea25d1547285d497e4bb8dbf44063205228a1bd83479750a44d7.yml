  The terms "chicken breast" and "chicken" refer to different parts of the chicken
  and have distinct nutritional profiles. Chicken breast is a lean protein that is
  low in fat and high in protein, while chicken refers to the meat of the chicken
  bird in general, which may include fattier cuts such as thighs and wings. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
