  While both pork chops and pork fat come from the same source (pigs), they have different
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking, making them distinct food items that shouldn''t
  be merged as semantic or ontological duplicates. Merging these two concepts would
  not accurately reflect their unique properties and roles in a culinary context.'
