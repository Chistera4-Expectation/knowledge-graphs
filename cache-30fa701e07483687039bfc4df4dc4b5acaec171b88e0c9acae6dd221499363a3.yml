  While both Orange Blossom Honey and Organic Clover Honey are types of honey, they
  have distinct characteristics that make them unique. Orange blossom honey is made
  from the nectar of orange flowers, which gives it a light citrus flavor, while organic
  clover honey is made from the nectar of clover plants and has a milder, floral taste.
  Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
