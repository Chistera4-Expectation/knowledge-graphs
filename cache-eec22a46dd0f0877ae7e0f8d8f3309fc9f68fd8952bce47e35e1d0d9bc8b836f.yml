text: No, these instances should not be merged together as they have different purposes
  and properties. Artisanal water refers to water that is produced in a small-scale,
  traditional, or craft manner, while water for egg wash is used specifically for
  brushing on egg wash before baking to create a shiny and golden appearance on baked
  goods. These are distinct concepts and should be kept separate.
