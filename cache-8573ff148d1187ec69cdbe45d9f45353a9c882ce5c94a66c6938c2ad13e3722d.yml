  While black rice and white rice are both types of rice, they have significant differences
  in terms of their nutritional content, taste, texture, and culinary uses. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates
  from a dietary perspective. Here is some more information on why:


  1. Nutritional Content: Black rice is often considered a healthier option than white
  rice due to its higher fiber, protein, and antioxidant content. White rice, while
  being a good source of carbohydrates, has lower amounts of these beneficial nutrients
  compared to black rice. Merging them would disregard these important distinctions.

  2. Taste and Texture: The taste and texture of black rice and white rice differ
  significantly. Black rice tends to have a nuttier flavor with a chewy texture when
  cooked, whereas white rice usually tastes milder and softer. These differences impact
  cooking methods, recipes, and overall dining experiences, making merging them less
  meaningful for those seeking specific flavors and textures.

  3. Culinary Uses: Due to their distinct properties, black rice and white rice serve
  different purposes in various cuisines around the world. For example, black rice
  is commonly used in Asian desserts like sticky rice puddings, whereas white rice
  is typically preferred in dishes such as sushi and Indian biryanis. By keeping them
  separate, users can better understand which type of rice suits particular meals
  or diets.

  4. Cultural Significance: In certain cultures, black rice holds historical and cultural
  value that differs from white rice. Labeling them as identical discards this rich
  heritage and may lead to misunderstandings regarding proper usage and appreciation.

  5. Dietary Restrictions and Preferences: Some individuals follow specific diets
  (e.g., gluten-free) or have personal preferences based on caloric intake, glycemic
  index, etc. Combining black rice and white rice into one category might hinder people
  looking for specific dietary options or restrictions.


  In summary, although black rice and white rice belong to the same general food group,
  there are valid reasons to maintain their unique identities within any classification
  system related to nutrition and gastronomy.'
