text: No, the instances 'Mushrooms' and 'White Button Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are types of edible
  mushrooms, they are distinct species with unique characteristics, properties, and
  nutritional values. Merging them would not accurately represent the variety and
  specificity of the different mushroom types.
