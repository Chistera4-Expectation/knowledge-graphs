text: No, Cultured Butter and Salted Butter should not be merged together as they
  are different types of butter with distinct characteristics. Cultured Butter is
  made from fermented cream, while Salted Butter is made from sweet cream and has
  added salt. They have different flavors and uses, and should be considered separate
  entities in a classification system.
