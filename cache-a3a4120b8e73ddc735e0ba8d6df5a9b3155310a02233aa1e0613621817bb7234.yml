text: ' No. Catfish and fresh fish are not semantic and ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged. While catfish is a type of edible fish, not all fresh fish
  are catfish. They belong to different taxonomic categories within the animal kingdom
  and have distinct nutritional profiles and characteristics that warrant separate
  listings.'
