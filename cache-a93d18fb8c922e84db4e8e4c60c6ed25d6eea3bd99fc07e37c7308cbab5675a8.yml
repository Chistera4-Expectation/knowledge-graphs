text: " No. While hot sauce and Piri Piri sauce may have some similarities (such as\
  \ being spicy), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Hot sauce is a\
  \ broad category of sauces that can include various ingredients and levels of heat,\
  \ while Piri Piri sauce refers to a specific type of hot sauce made with African\
  \ bird\u2019s eye chili peppers and other ingredients like citrus, garlic, and vinegar.\
  \ Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts together as\
  \ identical entities."
