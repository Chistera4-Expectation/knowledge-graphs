text: ' No. While both pieces of information are related to nutrition and serving
  sizes, they represent distinct concepts and serve different purposes for users who
  are interested in learning about cheese products. Calcium content refers specifically
  to the nutritional value of the product, while serving size relates more to portion
  control and consumption guidelines. Keeping these two properties separate allows
  for clearer and more specific communication with consumers.'
