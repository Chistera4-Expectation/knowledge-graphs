text: No, the instances 'Chicken of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Mushrooms' should not
  be merged together as they are not semantic and ontological duplicates. 'Chicken
  of the Woods Mushroom' is a specific type of edible mushroom, while 'Mushrooms'
  refers to the broader category that includes various types of fungi. Merging them
  would lead to confusion and loss of important information about each individual
  type of mushroom.
