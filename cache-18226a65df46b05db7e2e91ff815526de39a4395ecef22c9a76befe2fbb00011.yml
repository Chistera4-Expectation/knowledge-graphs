text: No, the instances 'Juice' and 'Watermelon juice' should not be merged together
  as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Juice' is a general category,
  while 'Watermelon juice' is a specific type of juice made from watermelons. They
  should remain separate instances within the Juice class.
