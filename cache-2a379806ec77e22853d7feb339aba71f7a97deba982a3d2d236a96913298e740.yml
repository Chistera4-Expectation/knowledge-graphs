text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are derived from ostriches, they are different parts of the animal with distinct
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Ostrich gizzards are a muscle found in the
  digestive tract, while ostrich thighs are a cut of meat from the leg. Merging them
  as duplicates would not accurately represent their unique characteristics and uses
  in the Poultry-derived Food class.
