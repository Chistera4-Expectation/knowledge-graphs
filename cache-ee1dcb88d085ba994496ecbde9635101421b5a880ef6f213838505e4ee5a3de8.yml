text: ' No. Canola oil and extra virgin olive oil are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, despite both being popular types of edible vegetable oils used for cooking
  and salad dressings. They have different nutritional profiles, chemical compositions,
  flavors, and ideal uses due to their distinct production processes and fatty acid
  content. Therefore, it is essential to maintain these terms separate when discussing
  various edible vegetable oils.'
