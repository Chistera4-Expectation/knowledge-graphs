text: No, "Chicken Meatballs" and "Quail Meat" should not be merged as they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. Although both are derived from poultry, they
  are different types of food products made from different types of poultry (chicken
  and quail). Chicken meatballs are a specific dish made from ground chicken, while
  quail meat refers to the meat of quail, a different bird species.
