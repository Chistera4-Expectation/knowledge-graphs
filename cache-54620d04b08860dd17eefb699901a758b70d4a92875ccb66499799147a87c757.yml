text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both cereals have "honey" and
  "nuts" in their names, they are produced by different brands (Post for Honey Bunches
  of Oats and General Mills for Honey Nut Cheerios) and have distinct recipes and
  ingredients. Merging them would be incorrect from both a semantic and ontological
  standpoint.
