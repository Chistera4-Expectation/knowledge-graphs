text: No, 'Black Tea' and 'Darjeeling Tea' are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Black tea is a type of tea, and Darjeeling tea is a specific variety of black tea
  grown in the Darjeeling district of India. While Darjeeling tea is a type of black
  tea, not all black tea is Darjeeling tea. Therefore, they should not be merged together.
