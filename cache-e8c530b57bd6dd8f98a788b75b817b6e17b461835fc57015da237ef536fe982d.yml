  While both Blueberry Honey and Orange Blossom Honey are types of honey, they have
  distinct flavors and characteristics that set them apart from one another. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Instead, each type of honey can be classified as a subcategory within the broader
  category of "Honey."'
