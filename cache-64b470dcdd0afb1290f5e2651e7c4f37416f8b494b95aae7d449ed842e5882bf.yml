text: ' No. While Parmesan cheese and Pecorino Romano cheese may have some similarities,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They differ in terms of their ingredients,
  taste, texture, production methods, and geographical origins, among other factors.
  Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate instances within the Cheese
  class.'
