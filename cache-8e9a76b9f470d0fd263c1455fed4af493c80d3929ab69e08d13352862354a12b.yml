text: No, 'Pheasant Gravy' and 'Pheasant Tenders' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different food items made from poultry.
  'Pheasant Gravy' is a sauce made from pheasant, while 'Pheasant Tenders' are pieces
  of pheasant meat, typically from the breast area. While they both come from the
  same source, they are distinct food items with different uses and properties.
