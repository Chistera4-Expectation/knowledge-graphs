  While both "Optional dipping sauce" and "Toppings of your choice" may seem similar
  at first glance, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They serve different
  purposes and can contain vastly different ingredients. Dipping sauces are typically
  wet condiments used for dipping food items before eating them, while toppings refer
  to additional ingredients that are placed on top of food after it has been cooked.
  Furthermore, toppings can include a wide variety of solid foods such as cheese,
  herbs, vegetables, and more. Therefore, these two concepts should remain separate.'
