text: ' Tea is the most appropriate choice for "Digestive Ease" between Coffee and
  Tea. While both beverages have their own unique benefits, tea has been traditionally
  known to aid in digestion due to its natural properties like antioxidants and soothing
  compounds such as L-theanine. Additionally, certain types of tea, especially herbal
  teas, are specifically formulated to promote digestive health. However, it''s important
  to note that individual responses may vary, and moderation should always be practiced
  when consuming caffeinated beverages.'
