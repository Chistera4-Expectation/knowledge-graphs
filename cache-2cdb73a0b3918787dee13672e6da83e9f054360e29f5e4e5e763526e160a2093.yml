  "Italian Seasoning" is a specific blend of herbs commonly used in Italian cuisine,
  typically including ingredients such as basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, and marjoram.
  It is a distinct and well-defined concept with a clear definition and purpose.


  On the other hand, "optional seasonings" refers to any additional seasonings that
  can be added to food according to personal preference, which could include salt,
  pepper, garlic powder, chili flakes, and many others. This category is much broader
  and more subjective than "Italian Seasoning," as it encompasses an almost limitless
  variety of potential flavor enhancers.


  Therefore, while there may be some overlap between these two concepts (for example,
  Italian Seasoning might fall under the umbrella of optional seasonings), they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates. They represent different levels of abstraction
  within the domain of food seasoning and serve distinct purposes for culinary exploration
  and expression.'
