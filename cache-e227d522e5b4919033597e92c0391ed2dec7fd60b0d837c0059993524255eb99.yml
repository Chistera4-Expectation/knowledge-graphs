  Although both are pork-derived and breaded, they differ in terms of culinary preparation,
  cultural origin, and possibly taste and texture. Pork Cutlet is a Japanese dish
  (Tonkatsu) and Pork Schnitzel is a German dish. They are not identical in nature
  and can be considered as separate entities within the Pork-derived Food class.
