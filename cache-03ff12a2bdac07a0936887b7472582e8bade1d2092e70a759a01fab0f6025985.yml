text: ' No. Although both "Calories per serving" and "Saturated fat per serving" provide
  information about the nutritional content of cheese, they measure different aspects
  of it. Calories give a general idea of how much energy a food provides, while saturated
  fat is a specific type of fat that can have negative effects on heart health when
  consumed in excess. Therefore, these two pieces of information serve distinct purposes
  and are not semantic or ontological duplicates.'
