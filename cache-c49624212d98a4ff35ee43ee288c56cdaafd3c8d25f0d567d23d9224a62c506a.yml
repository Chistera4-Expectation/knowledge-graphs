  Although acacia honey and tupelo honey may share some general characteristics as
  types of honey, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have
  distinct botanical origins, flavors, properties, and production methods that make
  them unique from each other. Acacia honey is primarily made from nectar collected
  by bees from various species of acacia flowers, while tupelo honey comes specifically
  from the nectar of white tupelo trees (Nyssa ogeche). As such, these two honeys
  possess different flavor profiles, with acacia honey being light, delicate, and
  mildly sweet, whereas tupelo honey tends to be richer, more buttery, and resistant
  to crystallization due to its higher fructose content. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge their identities as they represent separate and unique products
  within the domain of apiculture.'
