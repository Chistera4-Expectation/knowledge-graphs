  Pumpkin seed oil and vegetable oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged together. While both are types of oils that can be used in
  cooking and have some similar uses, they come from different sources (pumpkin seeds
  vs. various plants) and therefore have unique nutritional profiles and other properties.
  It is important to maintain separate categories for them to accurately reflect their
  distinct characteristics and uses.'
