text: As a dietician, I would say that "French Yogurt" and "Whole Milk Yogurt" are
  not necessarily semantic or ontologic duplicates. French yogurt refers to yogurt
  from France, which could be made from whole milk, but it could also be made from
  low-fat or non-fat milk. Whole milk yogurt specifically refers to yogurt made from
  whole milk, which can be produced in France or any other country. Therefore, these
  two instances represent different types of yogurt based on their origin and milk
  fat content. So, the answer is no, they should not be merged.
