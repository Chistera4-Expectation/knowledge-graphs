text: "No, the instances 'Pheasant Soup' and 'Pheasant Thighs' should not be merged\
  \ as semantic and ontologic duplicates because they are different types of food\
  \ derived from pheasant. Pheasant Soup is a liquid-based dish, typically made by\
  \ simmering pheasant meat and vegetables in a broth, while Pheasant Thighs refer\
  \ to a specific cut of pheasant meat that can be prepared in various ways, such\
  \ as roasting, grilling, or saut\xE9ing. Although both dishes are derived from the\
  \ same animal, they have distinct characteristics and preparation methods."
