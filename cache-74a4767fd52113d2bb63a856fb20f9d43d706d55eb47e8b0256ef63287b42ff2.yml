  While raw fish and salted fish can both be classified under edible fish, they are
  not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They refer to different types of fish preparations
  with distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and uses. Merging them would
  result in loss of important distinctions between these two concepts.'
