text: No, Morel Mushroom and White Button Mushroom should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are two different types of edible mushrooms with
  distinct characteristics, flavors, and nutritional profiles. Morel Mushrooms (Morchella
  spp.) are sponge-like in appearance, with a honeycomb-like structure, and are highly
  prized for their unique flavor and texture. White Button Mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus),
  on the other hand, are commonly found in grocery stores and are mild in flavor.
  They are often used in various dishes and can be grown easily. Therefore, they should
  be treated as separate entities in a dietician's Edible Mushrooms class.
