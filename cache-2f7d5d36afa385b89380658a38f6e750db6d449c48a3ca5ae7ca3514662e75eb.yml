  While both grapeseed oil and palm oil are indeed edible vegetable oils, they come
  from different plant sources (grape seeds vs. the fruit of oil palms) and have distinct
  nutritional profiles, production methods, and uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
