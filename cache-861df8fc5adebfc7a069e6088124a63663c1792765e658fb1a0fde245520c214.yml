  Although both Achiote paste and chili bean paste are used to add flavor to dishes,
  they have different ingredients, flavors, textures, and uses in cooking. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Achiote paste is made from ground annatto seeds mixed with spices such as cumin,
  coriander, garlic, salt, and vinegar, while chili bean paste is typically made from
  fermented soybeans, chilies, and various seasonings. They also serve distinct culinary
  functions: Achiote paste adds earthy, musky undertones and vibrant orange-red color
  to foods, whereas chili bean paste provides heat, umami, and rich depth of flavor.
  Thus, they cannot be treated as interchangeable terms.'
