text: No, Hazelnut Oil and Palm Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Merging them would not accurately represent their
  unique characteristics and could lead to confusion for those seeking specific information
  about each type of oil.
