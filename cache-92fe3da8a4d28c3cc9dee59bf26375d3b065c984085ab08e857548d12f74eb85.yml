text: No, the instances 'Vegetable' and 'vegetable stock' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Vegetable' refers to a type of plant that
  is typically eaten by humans, while 'vegetable stock' is a liquid made by simmering
  vegetables in water, usually used as a base for soups and sauces. Although both
  are related to vegetables, they are different concepts with distinct definitions
  and uses.
