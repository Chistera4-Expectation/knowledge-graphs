text: No, Fruit-Flavored Yogurt and Greek Yogurt should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Although both are types of yogurt, they have
  distinct characteristics and are not the same. Fruit-Flavored Yogurt typically has
  added fruit flavoring or fruit pieces, while Greek Yogurt is strained to achieve
  a thicker consistency and is often higher in protein. These differences in characteristics
  and attributes make them separate entities in a yogurt class.
