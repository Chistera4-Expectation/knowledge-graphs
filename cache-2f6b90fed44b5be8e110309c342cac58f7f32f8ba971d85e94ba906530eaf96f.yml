text: As a dietician, I cannot provide a definitive yes or no answer, as it depends
  on the specific context and purpose of the Tea class. However, if 'Earl Grey Tea'
  and 'Hibiscus Tea' are truly semantic and ontological duplicates, meaning they share
  the same properties and cannot be distinguished based on their attributes, then
  it may be appropriate to merge them. However, if they have distinct properties or
  characteristics, it would be more appropriate to keep them as separate instances.
