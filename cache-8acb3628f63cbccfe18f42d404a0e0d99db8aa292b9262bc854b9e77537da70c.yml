  While both Cherry Blossom honey and Raspberry honey may share some similarities
  as types of flower honeys, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they come from different plant sources (cherry blossoms vs raspberries) and have
  distinct flavors, aromas, and properties unique to their respective floral origins.
  Therefore, it is important to keep these two classes separate to accurately reflect
  their differences and maintain specificity in categorization.'
