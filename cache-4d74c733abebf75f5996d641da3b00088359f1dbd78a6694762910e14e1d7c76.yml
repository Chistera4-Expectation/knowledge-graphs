  While both Acacia honey and Buckwheat honey are types of honey, they have different
  properties and characteristics that make them unique and not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. For example, Acacia honey is known for its mild flavor, clear color,
  and high fructose content, while Buckwheat honey has a strong molasses-like flavor,
  dark color, and higher antioxidant levels. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
