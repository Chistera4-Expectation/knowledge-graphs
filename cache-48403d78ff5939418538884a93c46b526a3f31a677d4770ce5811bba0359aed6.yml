text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food. Guinea Fowl Meat refers to the meat from a guinea fowl, while Pheasant Meatballs
  are a specific dish made from ground pheasant meat, often mixed with other ingredients
  and formed into balls. Although both are derived from poultry, they are not semantically
  or ontologically duplicates.
