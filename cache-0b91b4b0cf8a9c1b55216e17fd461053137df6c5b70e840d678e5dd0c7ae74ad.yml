text: No, the instances 'Fat-Free Yogurt' and 'Whole Milk Yogurt' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of yogurt
  with distinct nutritional properties and characteristics. Fat-Free Yogurt has less
  fat content than Whole Milk Yogurt, which has a higher fat content due to the use
  of whole milk. These differences are significant and should be kept separate in
  a classification system.
