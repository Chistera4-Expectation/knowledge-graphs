text: No, "Quail Broth" and "Quail Patties" should not be merged together as they
  are different food items derived from quails. Quail Broth is a liquid food made
  by simmering quail meat and/or bones in water, while Quail Patties are solid food
  items made by grinding or mincing quail meat and forming it into patties, often
  with added ingredients like breadcrumbs or seasoning. These are distinct food products
  with different textures, preparations, and uses in recipes.
