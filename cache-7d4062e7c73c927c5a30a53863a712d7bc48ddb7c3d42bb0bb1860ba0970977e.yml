text: No, the instances 'Beech Mushroom' and 'Portobello Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible mushrooms,
  they are different species with distinct characteristics, uses, and nutritional
  profiles. Beech mushrooms belong to the genus Hypsizygus, while Portobello mushrooms
  belong to the genus Agaricus, specifically Agaricus bisporus.
