text: No, Apple juice and Peach juice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they may both be instances of the Juice class, they
  are distinct types of juice with different flavors, nutritional profiles, and other
  attributes. Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and potentially lead
  to confusion or misinformation.
