text: ' No. Cream cheese and mozzarella cheese are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they both fall under the general category of "cheese," they have distinct
  characteristics and uses due to differences in their texture, taste, nutritional
  profiles, and production methods. Merging them would lead to loss of important distinctions
  between these two types of cheese.'
