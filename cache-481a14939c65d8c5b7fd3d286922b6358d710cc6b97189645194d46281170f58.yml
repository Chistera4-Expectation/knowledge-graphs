text: No, "Chicken Wings" and "Duck Wings" should not be merged together as they are
  different types of poultry-derived food. Although they share similarities, they
  are distinct in terms of nutritional content, taste, and cultural significance.
  They belong to separate species and should be treated as individual instances in
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
