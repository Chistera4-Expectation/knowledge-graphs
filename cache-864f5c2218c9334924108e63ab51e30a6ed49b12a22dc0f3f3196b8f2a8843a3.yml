text: No, the instances 'Pheasant Stock' and 'Turkey Stock' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both stocks derived from
  poultry, they come from different types of birds and can have different nutritional
  profiles and flavor characteristics. They should be kept as separate instances within
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
