text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'Quail Eggs' and 'Quail
  Meatballs' are derived from poultry, specifically quail, they are different food
  items with distinct nutritional profiles and preparation methods. 'Quail Eggs' are
  whole eggs, while 'Quail Meatballs' are a mixture of ground quail meat and other
  ingredients, often seasoned and formed into balls before cooking. Merging these
  instances would not accurately reflect the differences between the two food items.
