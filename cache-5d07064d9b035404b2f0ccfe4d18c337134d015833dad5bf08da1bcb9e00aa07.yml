  Achiote paste and pepper to taste are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  have different flavors, uses, and purposes in cooking. Achiote paste is made from
  ground annatto seeds, garlic, salt, vinegar, oregano, cumin, and other spices, while
  "pepper to taste" refers to adding an amount of black or white pepper based on personal
  preference for flavor enhancement. Therefore, they should not be merged together
  as duplicates.'
