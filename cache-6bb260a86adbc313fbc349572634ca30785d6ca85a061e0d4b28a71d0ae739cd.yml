  Although both kefir and probiotic yogurts contain beneficial bacteria, they have
  distinct characteristics. Kefir is typically fermented with a different blend of
  bacteria and yeasts than probiotic yogurt, resulting in a thinner consistency and
  tangier flavor. Probiotic yogurt, on the other hand, is specifically designed to
  contain a high number of live and active probiotic cultures to promote gut health.
  Therefore, while they share some similarities, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates.
