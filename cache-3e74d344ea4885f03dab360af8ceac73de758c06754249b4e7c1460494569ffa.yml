text: ' No. While both "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Chicken Wings" are poultry-derived
  foods, they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they
  represent distinct dishes with different ingredients and nutritional profiles. A
  Chicken Caesar Salad typically includes romaine lettuce, croutons, parmesan cheese,
  and Caesar dressing, while Chicken Wings consist of chicken pieces that are often
  deep-fried or baked and can come with various sauces. Therefore, merging them as
  duplicates would not accurately reflect their unique culinary identities and nutritional
  values.'
