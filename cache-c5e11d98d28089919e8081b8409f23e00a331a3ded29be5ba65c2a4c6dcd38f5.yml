text: ' No. Avocado dressing and Italian dressing are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, and they should not be merged together. While both are types of salad
  dressings, they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and textures that make them
  unique from one another. Therefore, it is important to keep these two classes separate
  to accurately represent their differences.'
