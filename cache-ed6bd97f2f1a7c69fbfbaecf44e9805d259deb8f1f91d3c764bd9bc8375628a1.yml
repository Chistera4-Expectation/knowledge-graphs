text: ' No, corn husks and cornstarch should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are different parts of the corn plant with distinct uses and properties.
  Corn husks are the outer layers of leaves that wrap around an ear of corn, while
  cornstarch is a fine white powder made from the starchy endosperm of corn kernels.'
