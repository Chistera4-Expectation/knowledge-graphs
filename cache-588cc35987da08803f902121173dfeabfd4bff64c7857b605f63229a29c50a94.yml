  While chia seeds and poppy seeds have some similarities (for example, they are both
  small, oval-shaped seeds), they belong to different botanical families and possess
  distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Here''s why:


  1. Botanical differences: Chia seeds come from Salvia hispanica, which belongs to
  the mint family (Lamiaceae). In contrast, poppy seeds originate from Papaver somniferum,
  part of the poppy family (Papaveraceae). These two plants differ significantly in
  their taxonomy and characteristics.

  2. Nutritional content: Although both types of seeds provide health benefits, their
  specific nutrients vary. For instance, chia seeds contain more fiber, protein, omega-3
  fatty acids, and antioxidants than poppy seeds. On the other hand, poppy seeds offer
  higher amounts of calcium, iron, zinc, and certain B vitamins compared to chia seeds.
  Merging these seeds would overlook essential distinctions between their unique nutrient
  compositions.


  In conclusion, chia seeds and poppy seeds serve different purposes due to their
  varying botanical origins and nutritional properties; thus, they should not be merged
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
