text: 'As a dietician, I would not merge the instances ''Lactose-free Butter'' and
  ''Organic Butter'' as they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They are
  different types of butter with distinct characteristics:


  1. Lactose-free Butter: This type of butter is made from lactose-free milk or cream,
  which means it is suitable for individuals with lactose intolerance. It may be derived
  from cow''s milk, goat''s milk, or other sources.


  2. Organic Butter: This type of butter is made from organic milk or cream, which
  comes from cows raised on organic feed, without the use of hormones or antibiotics.
  Organic butter may or may not be lactose-free, as it depends on the specific brand
  and production process.


  While both types of butter can be made from cow''s milk, they have distinct attributes
  related to lactose content and farming practices. Therefore, they should not be
  merged as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
