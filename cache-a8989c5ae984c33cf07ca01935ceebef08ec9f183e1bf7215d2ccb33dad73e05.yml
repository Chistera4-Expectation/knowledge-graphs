  While both lemon juice and lemon wedges come from lemons, they have different nutritional
  profiles and uses in food preparation. Lemon juice is mostly water with some vitamin
  C, while lemon wedges contain fiber and are less concentrated in vitamin C than
  the juice. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.'
