text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both are types of juice, they are made from different fruits (blueberries
  and papaya) and have distinct nutritional profiles and flavor profiles. Merging
  them together would result in a loss of specificity and accuracy in representing
  the individual juices.
