  The instance ": The base ingredient of the sauce" refers to a general concept that
  can represent any individual ingredient used as the foundation for creating various
  sauces. On the other hand, "Barbecue sauce" is a specific type of sauce with its
  unique set of ingredients and preparation methods. Merging these two instances would
  not accurately reflect their distinct meanings and uses within the context of a
  sauce classification system.'
