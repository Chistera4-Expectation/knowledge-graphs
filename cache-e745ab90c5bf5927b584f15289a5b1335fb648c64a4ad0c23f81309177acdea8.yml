  While sesame oil and soybean oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct properties and uses due to their unique chemical compositions and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. It is essential to maintain separate entries for each type of oil to
  accurately represent their individual characteristics and applications.'
