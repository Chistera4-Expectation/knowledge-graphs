text: No, they should not be merged together. While they may both be classified as
  sauces, they have distinctly different ingredients, flavors, and uses. Mustard sauce
  typically contains mustard, vinegar, and various seasonings, while soy sauce is
  made from fermented soybeans and wheat, and has a salty, umami flavor. They are
  separate and distinct entities within the sauce category.
