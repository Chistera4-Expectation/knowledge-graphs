  While chia seeds and sesame seeds do share some similarities such as being small
  edible seeds that are good sources of fiber and healthy fats, they have several
  key differences that make them distinct from one another both semantically and ontologically.
  Chia seeds come from the Salvia hispanica plant and are known for their ability
  to absorb liquid and form a gel-like substance, making them useful for thickening
  foods and drinks. They are also particularly high in omega-3 fatty acids. Sesame
  seeds, on the other hand, come from the Sesamum indicum plant and are commonly used
  as a topping for breads, salads, and stir-fries. They have a rich, nutty flavor
  and are high in calcium and iron.


  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge chia seeds and sesame seeds as semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they have different properties, uses, and origins.'
