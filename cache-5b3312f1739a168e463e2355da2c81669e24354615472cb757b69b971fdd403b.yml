  While chili powder and onion powder are both types of food seasonings, they have
  different flavors, ingredients, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Keeping these
  terms distinct allows for more accurate labeling and categorization of foods, which
  is important for those with allergies, dietary restrictions, or specific taste preferences.'
