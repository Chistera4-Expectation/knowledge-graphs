text: No, 'Quail Meatballs' and 'Quail Nuggets' should not be merged as they are distinct
  preparations of quail meat. Merging them would not accurately reflect the differences
  in cooking methods, ingredients, and nutritional profiles between these two dishes.
  While they share the base ingredient of quail meat, their unique characteristics
  and forms make them separate entities within the Poultry-derived Food class.
