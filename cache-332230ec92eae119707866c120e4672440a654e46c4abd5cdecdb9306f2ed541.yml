text: No, Pork Belly and Pork Shank should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. They are different cuts of pork with distinct characteristics,
  nutritional values, and culinary uses. Pork Belly is a fatty cut often used for
  bacon or roasting, while Pork Shank is a leaner cut typically used for braising
  or stewing.
