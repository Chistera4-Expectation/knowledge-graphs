  While both chicken nuggets and turkey are types of poultry, they have different
  nutritional profiles and preparation methods. Chicken nuggets typically consist
  of processed and formed chicken meat, while "turkey - like chicken" refers to various
  forms of unprocessed turkey meat that may resemble chicken in terms of texture or
  taste. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
