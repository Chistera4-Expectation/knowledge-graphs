  While pomegranate seeds and pumpkin seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and botanical origins. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Keeping
  these instances separate allows for more accurate representation and differentiation
  between the two in terms of their unique properties and characteristics.'
