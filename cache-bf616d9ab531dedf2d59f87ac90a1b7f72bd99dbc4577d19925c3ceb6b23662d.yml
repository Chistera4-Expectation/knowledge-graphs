  Honey is a general term that refers to a sweet substance produced by honeybees from
  the nectar of flowers. On the other hand, Strawberry Honey is a specific type of
  honey made from the nectar of strawberry blossoms. Therefore, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates, but rather different types of honey with distinct flavors
  and properties.'
