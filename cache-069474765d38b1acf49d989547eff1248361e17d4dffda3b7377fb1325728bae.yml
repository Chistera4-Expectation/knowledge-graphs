text: ' No. While poppy seeds and sunflower seeds are both types of edible seeds,
  they have distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking and baking. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.
  It is important to maintain separate entries for each type of seed in order to accurately
  convey their unique characteristics and benefits.'
