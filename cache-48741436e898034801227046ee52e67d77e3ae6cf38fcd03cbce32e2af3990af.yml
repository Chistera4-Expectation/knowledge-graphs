text: No, Turkey Liver and Turkey Meatballs should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they both come from turkey, they are different types
  of food with distinct nutritional profiles and cooking methods. Turkey Liver is
  an organ meat rich in iron, vitamin A, and vitamin B12, while Turkey Meatballs are
  a processed food made from ground turkey, often containing added ingredients like
  breadcrumbs and spices.
