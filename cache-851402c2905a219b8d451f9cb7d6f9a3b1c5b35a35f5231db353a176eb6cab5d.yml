  While both "cooked rice" and "rice paper wrappers" are related to rice, they have
  different meanings and uses in culinary contexts. Cooked rice is a staple food made
  by boiling or steaming rice grains until they become soft and edible, whereas rice
  paper wrappers are thin sheets of dried rice paste used for making various Asian
  dishes like spring rolls. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
