text: ' No. Ice cream and sour cream are not semantic and ontological duplicates because
  they have different nutritional profiles, uses, and physical properties. While both
  products fall under the broader category of dairy, merging them into one instance
  would not accurately reflect their distinct characteristics and roles in food production
  and consumption.'
