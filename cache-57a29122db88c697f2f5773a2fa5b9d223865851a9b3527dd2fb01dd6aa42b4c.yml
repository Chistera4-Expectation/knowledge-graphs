text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct food items made
  from pheasant. Pheasant Gravy is a liquid sauce made from pheasant stock and other
  ingredients, while Pheasant Meatballs are solid, round meat dishes made from ground
  pheasant meat and other ingredients. Although they both come from the same animal
  source, they are different in terms of their culinary preparation and use.
