text: No, distilled water and spring water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  characteristics and origins. Distilled water is produced by boiling water and condensing
  the resulting steam, which removes impurities and minerals. Spring water, on the
  other hand, is naturally occurring underground water that flows to the surface,
  often containing minerals and other natural elements.
