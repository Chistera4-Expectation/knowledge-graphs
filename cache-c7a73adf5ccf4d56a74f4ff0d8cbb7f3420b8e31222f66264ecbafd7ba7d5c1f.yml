text: No, the instances 'Hermit Crab' and 'Mitten Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are crustaceans, they belong
  to different families and have distinct characteristics. Hermit crabs (Paguroidea)
  are known for their unique ability to use gastropod shells for protection, while
  mitten crabs (Eriocheir) are characterized by their hairy claws resembling mittens.
