text: ' No. Cottonseed oil and safflower oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While they are both types of edible vegetable
  oils, they come from different plants (cotton seeds vs. safflower seeds) and have
  distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to
  maintain them as separate entities in order to provide accurate information about
  each one.'
