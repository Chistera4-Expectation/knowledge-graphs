text: ' Edible Spices would be the most appropriate class for spices, as it is specific
  to that food group and distinguishes it from the other options provided. While some
  of the other classes such as "Edible Vegetables" or "Edible Seeds" may contain herbs
  and spices, they are not exclusively dedicated to them. Therefore, creating a separate
  category for spices allows for clearer organization and differentiation within the
  given choices.'
