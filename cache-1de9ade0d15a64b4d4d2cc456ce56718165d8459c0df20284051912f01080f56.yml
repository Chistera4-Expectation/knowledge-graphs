text: ' Neither coffee nor tea are appropriate as classes for an electrolyte solution.
  Electrolytes are substances that conduct electricity when dissolved in water, such
  as sodium chloride (salt), potassium chloride, and calcium chloride. Common commercial
  electrolyte solutions include sports drinks or oral rehydration solutions. Therefore,
  there is no suitable concise class name for ''electrolyte solution'' among coffee
  and tea.'
