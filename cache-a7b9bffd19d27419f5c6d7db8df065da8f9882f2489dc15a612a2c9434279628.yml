text: No, they should not be merged together. Red Pepper Flakes and Red Wine Vinegar
  serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics in terms of flavor, usage,
  and preparation. Red Pepper Flakes are used for adding heat and spiciness, while
  Red Wine Vinegar is used for adding acidity and a tangy flavor. These are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
