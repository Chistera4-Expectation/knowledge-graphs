  While both "trans fat per serving" and "serving size of the cheese" provide information
  about the nutritional content of cheese, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They represent different aspects of nutrition: one is a specific type of fat found
  in some cheeses (trans fat), while the other refers to the quantity of cheese being
  considered for consumption (serving size). Merging these two properties would result
  in loss of important distinctions related to cheese nutrition.'
