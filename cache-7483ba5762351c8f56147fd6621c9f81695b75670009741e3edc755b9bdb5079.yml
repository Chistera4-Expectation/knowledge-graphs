  Although both Basmati rice and cooked white rice are types of rice, they have different
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Basmati rice is a long-grain variety that is richer in fiber and certain minerals
  compared to regular white rice. It also has a distinctive aroma and flavor. Cooked
  white rice, on the other hand, typically refers to milled rice that has been stripped
  of its bran layer, resulting in lower levels of fiber and some vitamins and minerals.
  The cooking properties and texture of these two types of rice can also differ significantly.


  Therefore, while Basmati rice and cooked white rice may share some commonalities,
  they cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates due to their unique
  characteristics and applications.'
