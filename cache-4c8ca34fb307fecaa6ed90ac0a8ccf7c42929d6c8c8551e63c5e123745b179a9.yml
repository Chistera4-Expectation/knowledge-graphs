text: No, Flaxseed Oil and Walnut Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they share the common characteristic of being edible
  vegetal oils, they have distinct nutritional profiles and uses. Flaxseed Oil is
  a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, while Walnut Oil is known for its high content
  of polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants. Merging them together would obscure
  these unique properties and be misleading to consumers.
