text: ' No, flaxseeds and pomegranate seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of seeds, they come from different
  plants (flax and pomegranate, respectively) and have distinct nutritional profiles,
  health benefits, and uses in cooking and baking. Therefore, it is important to keep
  them separate when discussing or categorizing edible seeds.'
