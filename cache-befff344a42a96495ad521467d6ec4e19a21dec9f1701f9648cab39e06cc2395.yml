text: No, Snow Crab and Spider Crab should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they are both edible crustaceans, they belong to different
  genera and have distinct characteristics. Snow Crab (Chionoecetes) and Spider Crab
  (Majidae) have different appearances, habitats, and culinary uses.
