text: No, "Chicken Gravy" and "Turkey Gravy" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both poultry-derived gravies, they are
  made from different types of poultry, resulting in different flavors and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, they should be treated as distinct instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
