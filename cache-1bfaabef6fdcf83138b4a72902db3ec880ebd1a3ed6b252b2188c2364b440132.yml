  While both hemp seeds and mustard seeds are indeed edible seeds, they belong to
  different plant species and have distinct nutritional profiles and uses. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Here''s
  why:


  1. Botanical differences: Hemp seeds come from the Cannabis sativa plant, while
  mustard seeds originate from various Brassica species (such as Brassica juncea or
  Brassica nigra). They belong to entirely different botanical families (Cannabaceae
  for hemp seeds and Brassicaceae for mustard seeds), which means their genetic makeup,
  growth habits, and environmental requirements differ significantly.


  2. Nutritional differences: Although both types of seeds offer health benefits,
  they contain unique combinations of nutrients. For instance, hemp seeds are an excellent
  source of plant-based protein and omega-3 fatty acids, whereas mustard seeds provide
  higher amounts of selenium, magnesium, and certain antioxidants like glucosinolates.
  Merging these two would disregard their individual nutritional contributions.


  3. Culinary applications: Both seeds serve diverse culinary purposes due to their
  distinctive flavors and textures. Hemp seeds possess a subtle, nutty taste and can
  be sprinkled on salads, added to smoothies, or used as a milk alternative. On the
  other hand, mustard seeds contribute sharp, pungent flavors when ground into condiments
  like mustard or incorporated into pickling spices. Combining these two seeds under
  one category could lead to confusion regarding their specific uses in recipes and
  cooking techniques.


  In summary, merging hemp seeds and mustard seeds as semantic and ontological duplicates
  is not advisable because they represent separate botanical categories with distinct
  nutritional properties and culinary applications.'
