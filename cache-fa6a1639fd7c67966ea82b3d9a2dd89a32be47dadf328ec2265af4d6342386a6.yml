  While both chili peppers and scotch bonnet peppers are types of peppers, they belong
  to different species and have distinct differences in terms of their flavor, heat
  level, and uses in cooking. Chili peppers (Capsicum annuum) are native to Central
  and South America, while scotch bonnet peppers (Capsicum chinense) are native to
  the Caribbean and West Africa. Scotch bonnet peppers are generally considered hotter
  than chili peppers and have a more fruity and slightly sweet flavor. They are also
  used in different cuisines and dishes, so it would not be appropriate to merge them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
