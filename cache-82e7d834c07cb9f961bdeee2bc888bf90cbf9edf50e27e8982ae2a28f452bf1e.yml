  While both creamed honey and regular honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their texture, production process, and sometimes taste.
  Creamed honey is made by controlling the crystallization process to produce a smooth,
  spreadable consistency, while regular honey remains liquid unless it spontaneously
  crystallizes over time. Due to these differences, I would recommend treating them
  as separate entities rather than merging them into one category for nutritional
  and culinary purposes.'
