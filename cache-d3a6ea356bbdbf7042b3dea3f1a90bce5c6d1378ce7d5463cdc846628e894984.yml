text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are derived from poultry, they are different food items with distinct characteristics
  and preparation methods. Ostrich meatballs are a dish made with ground ostrich meat,
  while quail meat refers to the meat from quail birds.
