text: No, 'Duck Gravy' and 'Duck Tenders' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both poultry-derived food items, they have distinct
  properties and uses. Duck Gravy is a sauce made from duck meat and broth, while
  Duck Tenders are pieces of duck meat, typically used as a main dish or an appetizer.
  They serve different purposes in a meal and are not interchangeable.
