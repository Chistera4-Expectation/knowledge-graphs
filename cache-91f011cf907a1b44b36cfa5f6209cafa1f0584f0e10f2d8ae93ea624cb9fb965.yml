  While both "pork chops" and "roasted pork" are types of pork dishes, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to different cuts and preparations
  of meat. Pork chops typically come from the loin section of the pig and can be grilled,
  fried, baked, etc., while roasted pork usually refers to an entire piece (such as
  a pork shoulder or leg) that has been slow-cooked with dry heat methods like oven
  roasting or barbecuing. Therefore, these two concepts have distinct meanings within
  the context of food classification.'
