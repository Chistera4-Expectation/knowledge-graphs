text: No, Icelandic Yogurt and Skyr Yogurt should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they share similarities, they are distinct
  types of yogurt with slight differences in taste, texture, and production methods.
  Icelandic Yogurt, also known as skyr, is a traditional Icelandic dairy product that
  has a thicker consistency and a slightly tangier taste compared to regular yogurt.
  On the other hand, Skyr Yogurt is a specific brand that specializes in producing
  Icelandic-style yogurt. While the term "Skyr Yogurt" may refer to Icelandic Yogurt
  in general, it is still a distinct brand within the broader category of Icelandic
  Yogurt.
