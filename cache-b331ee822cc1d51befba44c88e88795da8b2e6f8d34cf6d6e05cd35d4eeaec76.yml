text: ' No. Alfalfa honey and buckwheat honey are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of honey. They have distinct differences in terms of their
  nutritional profiles, flavor, color, and plant sources, which make them unique from
  one another. Therefore, they should not be merged as duplicates.'
