text: No, Blewit Mushroom and Porcini Mushroom should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the Edible Mushrooms class, they
  are distinct species with unique characteristics and nutritional profiles. Merging
  them would result in the loss of important information about each mushroom.
