text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct characteristics, nutritional
  profiles, and origins. Short-grain rice is a type of rice with a short, plump grain
  that becomes soft and sticky when cooked, while wild rice is a seed that comes from
  a type of aquatic grass and has a nuttier flavor, chewy texture, and higher nutritional
  content.
