text: ' No. Quinoa seeds and watermelon seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they belong to different types of plants (quinoa vs. watermelon), have distinct
  nutritional profiles, and do not share the same culinary uses. Merging them would
  result in incorrect information and lead to confusion.'
