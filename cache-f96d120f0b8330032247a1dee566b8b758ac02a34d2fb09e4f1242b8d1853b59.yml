text: "As a dietician, I can provide information about the nutritional differences\
  \ between A2 Butter and Light Butter, but I cannot determine whether they should\
  \ be merged as duplicates. This decision should be made based on the specifics of\
  \ the classification system being used. \n\nFrom a nutritional standpoint, A2 Butter\
  \ and Light Butter are different:\n\n1. A2 Butter: This type of butter is made from\
  \ the milk of cows that produce only the A2 type of beta-casein protein, which some\
  \ people find easier to digest compared to milk with both A1 and A2 proteins. A2\
  \ Butter is typically higher in fat and calories compared to Light Butter.\n\n2.\
  \ Light Butter: This type of butter is made with a lower fat content, often by replacing\
  \ some of the fat with water or air. Light Butter usually contains fewer calories\
  \ and less fat compared to regular butter, including A2 Butter.\n\nIn conclusion,\
  \ A2 Butter and Light Butter have different nutritional profiles, so they should\
  \ not be considered semantic or ontologic duplicates based solely on their nutritional\
  \ characteristics. However, the decision to merge them as duplicates would depend\
  \ on the specific context and classification system being used."
