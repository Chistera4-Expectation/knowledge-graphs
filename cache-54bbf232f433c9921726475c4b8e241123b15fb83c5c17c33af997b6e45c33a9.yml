text: No, Almond Oil and Grapeseed Oil should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of edible vegetal oils with different nutritional profiles and uses. Although
  they both fall under the category of edible vegetal oils, they have unique properties
  and characteristics that make them separate entities.
