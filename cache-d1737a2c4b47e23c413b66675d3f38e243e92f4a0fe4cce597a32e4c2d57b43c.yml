text: No, Parmesan cheese and Ricotta cheese should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are two different types of cheese with distinct characteristics,
  ingredients, and uses. Parmesan is a hard, aged cheese made from cow's milk, while
  Ricotta is a soft, fresh cheese made from whey, a byproduct of cheese production.
