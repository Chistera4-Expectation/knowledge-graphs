text: No, the instances 'Flavored Water' and 'Soft Water' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of water, they have
  distinct properties and characteristics. Flavored Water refers to water with added
  natural or artificial flavors, while Soft Water refers to water with low mineral
  content and is typically used for drinking, cooking, and other household purposes.
  They are not semantically or ontologically equivalent.
