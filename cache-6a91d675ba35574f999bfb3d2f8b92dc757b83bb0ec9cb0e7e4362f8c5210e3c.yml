text: No, Fennel Seeds and Mustard Seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both seeds used for seasoning, they have
  distinct flavors, uses, and nutritional profiles. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the differences between these two seasonings.
