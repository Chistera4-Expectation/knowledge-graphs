text: As a dietician, my role is to provide guidance on nutrition and not to determine
  classifications within a programming context. However, from a food perspective,
  "Grilled Bread" and "Soda Bread" are different types of bread, and it would not
  be accurate to merge them as semantic or ontologic duplicates. Grilled Bread refers
  to bread that has been toasted or grilled, while Soda Bread is a specific type of
  bread made with baking soda as a leavening agent.
