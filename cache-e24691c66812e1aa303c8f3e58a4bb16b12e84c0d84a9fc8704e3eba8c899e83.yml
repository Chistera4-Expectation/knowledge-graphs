text: No, Cultured Butter and Whipped Butter should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of butter, they have distinct
  characteristics and production processes. Cultured Butter is made from fermented
  cream, which gives it a tangy flavor, while Whipped Butter is aerated to create
  a light and fluffy texture. Therefore, they should remain separate entities in the
  Butter class.
