text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both "Ostrich Patties" and "Ostrich Sausage" are derived from ostrich meat, they
  are different food products with distinct shapes and preparation methods. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the specific types of poultry-derived foods
  available.
