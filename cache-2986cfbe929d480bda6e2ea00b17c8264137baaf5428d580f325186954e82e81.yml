text: ' No. Arborio rice and brown rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. While both are types of rice, they have
  different properties and uses in cooking due to variations in their composition
  and characteristics. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate entities
  for accurate culinary and nutritional information.'
