text: ' No. While both pork shoulder and pork tenderloin are cuts of pork, they have
  different properties such as texture, flavor, cooking time, and fat content, making
  them distinct from one another. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
