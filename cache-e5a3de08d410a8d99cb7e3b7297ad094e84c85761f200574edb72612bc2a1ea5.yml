text: No, Chicken Sausage and Chicken Thighs should not be merged together as they
  are different food items with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Although
  they both come from chicken, they are processed differently and have different nutritional
  values, making them unique within the Poultry-derived Food class.
