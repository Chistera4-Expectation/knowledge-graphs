text: As a dietician, my role is to provide information about the nutritional aspects
  of food, not to determine the classification or structure of computer programming
  classes. However, based on the given information, it seems that the 'Batter' and
  'Ciabatta Bread' instances might represent different types of bread, and therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
