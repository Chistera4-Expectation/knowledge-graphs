text: ' Among the given food classes, ''Bread'' is most adequately categorized as
  ''Grain Product'' due to its primary ingredient being wheat or other grains. However,
  since this specific term isn''t provided in your list, I would suggest that ''Bread''
  can be classified under ''Starchy Foods,'' which also includes rice, pasta, and
  potatoes.'
