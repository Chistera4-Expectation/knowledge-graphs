text: No, Jasmine Tea and White Tea should not be merged as they are distinct types
  of tea with different characteristics. Jasmine Tea is a type of green tea scented
  with jasmine flowers, while White Tea is a type of tea made from young tea leaves
  and buds that are minimally processed. Although they may share some general characteristics
  of being teas, they have unique properties that differentiate them from each other.
