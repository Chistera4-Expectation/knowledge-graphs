text: ' No. While "cheese" and "serving size of cheese" are related concepts, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to different aspects
  of cheese. "Cheese" refers to a type of food made from milk, while "serving size
  of cheese" refers to the quantity of cheese being considered for nutritional purposes.
  Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate when modeling cheese-related
  knowledge.'
