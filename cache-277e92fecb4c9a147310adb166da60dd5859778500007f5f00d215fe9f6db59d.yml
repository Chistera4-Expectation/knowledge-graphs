  While hemp seeds and pumpkin seeds have some similarities (for example, they are
  both sources of protein and healthy fats), they also have important differences
  that make them distinct from one another. Hemp seeds come from the cannabis sativa
  plant and contain high levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, while pumpkin
  seeds are rich in iron, magnesium, and zinc. Merging these two instances would result
  in a loss of valuable information about their unique nutritional profiles and potential
  health benefits. Therefore, it is best to keep "hemp seeds" and "pumpkin seeds"
  as separate entities in this context.'
