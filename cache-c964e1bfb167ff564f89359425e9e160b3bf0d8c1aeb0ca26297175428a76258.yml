text: ' No. While grated Parmesan cheese does contain saturated fat, it is not a duplicate
  of "saturated fat per serving." Grated Parmesan cheese is a specific type of food
  product, while saturated fat per serving refers to a nutritional component found
  in many different types of foods. Therefore, they are distinct concepts that serve
  different purposes in a knowledge graph or database related to nutrition and dietetics.'
