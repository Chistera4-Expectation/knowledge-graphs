text: ' Among the given options, none of them are sufficient to be an adequate class
  for antioxidants as they describe types of food additives or ingredients rather
  than being a food group or category rich in antioxidants. Antioxidants can be found
  in various foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes. Therefore,
  no single option is an adequate class for antioxidants alone.'
