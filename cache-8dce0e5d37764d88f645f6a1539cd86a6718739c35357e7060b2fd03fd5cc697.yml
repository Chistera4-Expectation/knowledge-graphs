text: No, "Duck Meatballs" and "Duck Nuggets" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from duck, they have different
  preparation methods and shapes, which may result in variations in nutritional content
  and cooking properties. They should be treated as separate instances within the
  Poultry-derived Food class.
