text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. While both 'Energy Drink' and 'Hype Energy'
  are related, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. 'Energy Drink' is
  a general term for a class of beverages that contain stimulants such as caffeine,
  while 'Hype Energy' is a specific brand of energy drink. The two should not be merged
  together as they represent different levels of specificity within the energy drink
  category.
