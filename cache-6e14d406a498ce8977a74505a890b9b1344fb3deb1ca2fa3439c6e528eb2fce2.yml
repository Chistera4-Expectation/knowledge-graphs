  Carbohydrates per serving and Cholesterol per serving are not semantic nor ontological
  duplicates in the context of cheese classification for a dietician. They measure
  different nutritional aspects of cheese servings:


  1. Carbohydrates per serving refers to the amount of carbohydrate content (measured
  in grams) present in a single serving of cheese. This is important information for
  those following low-carb diets or monitoring their sugar intake.

  2. Cholesterol per serving indicates the quantity of cholesterol (also measured
  in milligrams) found in a serving of cheese. High cholesterol levels can contribute
  to heart disease, so individuals with specific health concerns need this data when
  planning their dietary choices.


  Merging these two attributes would lead to confusion and loss of essential nutritional
  information. Thus, it is crucial to maintain them separately within a well-structured
  cheese classification system.'
