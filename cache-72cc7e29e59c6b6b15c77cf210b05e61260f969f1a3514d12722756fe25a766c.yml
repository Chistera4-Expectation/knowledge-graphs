text: No, Peanut Oil and Rice Bran Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they both belong to the category of edible vegetable oils,
  they have different properties, nutritional values, and uses. Peanut Oil is extracted
  from peanuts and has a high smoke point, making it suitable for high-temperature
  cooking, while Rice Bran Oil is extracted from the germ and inner husk of rice and
  is rich in antioxidants and vitamin E. The two oils have distinct characteristics
  and should be treated separately.
