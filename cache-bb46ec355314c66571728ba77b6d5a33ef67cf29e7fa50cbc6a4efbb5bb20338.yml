  While hot sauce and tomato sauce may both fall under the general category of sauces,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct characteristics,
  ingredients, uses, and flavors that differentiate them from one another. Hot sauce
  is typically made with chili peppers, vinegar, and spices, resulting in a spicy
  flavor profile, while tomato sauce usually consists of tomatoes, onions, garlic,
  and various herbs and seasonings for a richer, tangier taste. Merging these two
  concepts would disregard their unique properties and potential applications in recipes.'
