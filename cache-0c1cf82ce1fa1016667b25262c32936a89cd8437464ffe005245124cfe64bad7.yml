text: 'No. The instances ''Culinary Herbs'' and ''Herbs'' are not semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are distinct concepts with different meanings and purposes.


  * **Culinary Herbs:** are herbs specifically used in cooking and seasoning food,
  often for flavor, aroma, or medicinal purposes.

  * **Herbs:** are a broader category of plants that include culinary herbs, as well
  as other plants used for medicinal purposes, landscape purposes, or other uses.


  Therefore, ''Culinary Herbs'' is a subset of ''Herbs'' that specifically refers
  to herbs used in cooking, while ''Herbs'' encompasses a wider range of plant categories.'
