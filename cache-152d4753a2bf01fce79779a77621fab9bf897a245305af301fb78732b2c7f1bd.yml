text: ' No. While slipper lobsters and squat lobsters are both types of crustaceans
  that resemble true lobsters to some extent, they belong to different taxonomic families
  (Scaridae and Galatheidae, respectively) and have distinct anatomical features,
  behaviors, and habitats. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
