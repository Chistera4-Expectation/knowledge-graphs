text: No, they should not be merged. Lactose-free milk is derived from dairy milk
  but has the lactose removed or altered, making it suitable for those with lactose
  intolerance. Rice milk, on the other hand, is a non-dairy milk alternative made
  from rice. They are different types of milk with distinct nutritional profiles and
  origins.
