text: No, Hibiscus Tea and Lemon Tea should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct types of tea, with different flavors,
  ingredients, and potentially different nutritional profiles. While they may both
  be classified as "tea" in a general sense, they are not duplicates.
