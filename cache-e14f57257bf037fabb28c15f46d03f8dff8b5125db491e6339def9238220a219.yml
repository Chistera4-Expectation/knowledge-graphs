  While both are derived from pork, they are different types of food with distinct
  characteristics, uses, and nutritional profiles. "Pork" refers to the meat of a
  pig, while "salt pork" is specifically pork that has been preserved in salt. Merging
  them as duplicates would not accurately represent the distinctions between the two.
