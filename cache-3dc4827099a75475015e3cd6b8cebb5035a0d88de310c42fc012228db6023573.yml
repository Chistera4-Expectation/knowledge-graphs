text: No, Fruit-Flavored Yogurt and Non-Dairy Yogurt should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of yogurt, they differ in their
  characteristics. Fruit-Flavored Yogurt contains dairy, while Non-Dairy Yogurt does
  not. Merging them would not accurately represent their distinct qualities.
