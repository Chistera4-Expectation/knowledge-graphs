text: No, they should not be merged together as they represent different food items
  with distinct nutritional values and preparation methods. Chicken meatballs are
  a dish made from ground chicken meat, while chicken stock is a liquid base made
  from simmering chicken bones, meat, and vegetables. They are separate entities in
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
