text: ' The food category with the highest average sodium content is likely to be
  "Food Seasoning," as seasonings such as salt are often high in sodium. However,
  it''s important to note that sodium can also be found in many other types of foods,
  and individual items within each category may have varying amounts of sodium. It''s
  always best to check the nutrition label to determine the specific sodium content
  of a particular food item.'
