text: ' ''Sauce'' or ''Food Dressing'' would be the most adequate classes for ''Propellants.''
  These categories often include ingredients that can enhance the flavor and texture
  of food, similar to how propellants work in other contexts. However, it is important
  to note that not all sauces or dressings act as propellants, so specificity may
  still be necessary depending on the exact definition of "propellant" being used.'
