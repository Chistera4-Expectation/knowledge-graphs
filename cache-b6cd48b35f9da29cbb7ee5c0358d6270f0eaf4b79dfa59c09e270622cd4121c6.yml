  While both comb honey and creamed honey are types of honey, they have different
  physical properties and production methods. Comb honey is pure, raw honey still
  contained within the original hexagonal wax cells of the beehive, while creamed
  honey (also known as whipped honey) has been processed to create a spreadable consistency
  through controlled crystallization. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two concepts as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
