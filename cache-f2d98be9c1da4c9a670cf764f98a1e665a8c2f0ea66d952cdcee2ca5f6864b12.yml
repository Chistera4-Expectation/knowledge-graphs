text: As a dietician, I would recommend that the instances 'Condiments' and 'Optional
  ingredients' should not be merged together, as they serve different purposes and
  have distinct characteristics in a recipe. Condiments are typically used to enhance
  the flavor of a dish, while optional ingredients are those that can be added or
  omitted without significantly changing the dish's core components. Merging these
  instances would cause confusion and make it difficult to differentiate between the
  two when creating or analyzing recipes.
