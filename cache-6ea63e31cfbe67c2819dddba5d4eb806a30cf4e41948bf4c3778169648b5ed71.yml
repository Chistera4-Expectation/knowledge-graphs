text: No, the instances 'Blewit Mushroom' and 'Portobello Mushroom' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible
  mushrooms, they are distinct species with unique characteristics, nutritional profiles,
  and culinary uses. Merging them would result in a loss of valuable information and
  specificity in the classification of these mushrooms.
