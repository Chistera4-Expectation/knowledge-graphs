text: As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on this topic. From a nutritional
  standpoint, "Sugar" and "White sugar" can be considered semantic and ontologic duplicates
  since they refer to the same substance, which is sucrose. However, in a more general
  context, "Sugar" might refer to any sweetening agent, including natural and artificial
  alternatives. Therefore, it might be beneficial to keep both terms separate to account
  for this broader context.
