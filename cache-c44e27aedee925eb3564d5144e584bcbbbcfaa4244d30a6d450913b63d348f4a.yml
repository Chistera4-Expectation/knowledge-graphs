text: No, coconut water and sparkling water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are liquid beverages, they have different compositions,
  nutritional properties, and effects on the body. Coconut water is a natural electrolyte-rich
  drink derived from young green coconuts, while sparkling water is carbonated water
  without any added sweeteners or flavors. They serve different purposes and should
  be considered separately in the context of dietary recommendations.
