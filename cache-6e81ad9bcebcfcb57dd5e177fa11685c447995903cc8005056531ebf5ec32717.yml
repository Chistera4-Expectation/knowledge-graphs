text: ' No. While peas and snow peas are both types of edible vegetables, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses, so they should not be merged as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. For example, peas are typically higher in protein
  and fiber compared to snow peas, while snow peas contain more vitamin C. Additionally,
  snow peas are often eaten pods and all, whereas garden peas are usually shelled
  before eating. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate categories
  for accurate nutrition information and recipe development.'
