  However, from a semantic perspective, if "Cherry Vanilla Infusion" and "Infused
  Tea" refer to the same type of beverage, they could be considered duplicates. But,
  without additional context or information on the specific characteristics of each,
  I cannot definitively say whether they should be merged or not.
