text: ' No. Raspberry honey and raw wildflower honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they refer to different types of honey with distinct characteristics.
  Raspberry honey is made from the nectar of raspberry flowers, while raw wildflower
  honey can come from various flower sources found in the wild. Although both are
  types of honey, they have unique properties that make them non-duplicative.'
