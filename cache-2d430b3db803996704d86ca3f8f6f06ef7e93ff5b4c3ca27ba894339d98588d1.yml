text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  they are both mushrooms, Portobello and White Button Mushrooms have distinct characteristics,
  appearances, and uses in cooking. They are different species (Agaricus bisporus)
  but represent different stages of development. White Button Mushrooms are the youngest
  stage, while Portobello Mushrooms are fully mature, with a larger cap and a meatier
  texture. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between the
  two.
