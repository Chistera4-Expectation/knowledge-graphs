text: " No.\n\nWhile both \"chicken breast\" and \"chicken broth\" are derived from\
  \ chickens, they have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Chicken\
  \ breast is a lean source of protein that can be grilled, baked, or saut\xE9ed,\
  \ while chicken broth is primarily liquid with some dissolved proteins, vitamins,\
  \ and minerals obtained by simmering chicken parts (often including breasts) with\
  \ vegetables and herbs. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as\
  \ semantic and ontological duplicates."
