text: No, 'Hollandaise sauce' and 'Mole sauce' should not be merged together. Although
  both are sauces, they are distinct in terms of their ingredients, preparation, and
  cultural origins. Hollandaise sauce is a French sauce made with egg yolks, butter,
  and lemon juice, while Mole sauce is a Mexican sauce made with a variety of ingredients,
  including chili peppers, nuts, and chocolate. They serve different purposes and
  flavor profiles, and thus should remain separate entities in a classification system.
