text: ' The most adequate class for Gelatin would be "Animal Derivatives" or specifically,
  "Collagen Proteins". However, if we are looking for the closest food groups from
  your list, then it would be "Pork-derived Foods" or "Poultry-derived Foods", as
  gelatin is often derived from animal bones and connective tissues. But keep in mind
  that gelatin can also be produced from other sources like fish (fish gelatin) or
  plant-based materials (agar agar, pectin).'
