text: ' No, water chestnuts and watercress are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. They are two distinct types of edible vegetables with
  different nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and growth habits. Water chestnuts
  (Eleocharis dulcis) are aquatic tubers that have a crisp texture and mild flavor,
  often used in Asian cuisine for their crunchiness. On the other hand, watercress
  (Nasturtium officinale) is an aquatic leafy green vegetable related to mustard greens,
  known for its peppery taste and high levels of vitamins A, C, and K. Merging these
  two concepts would result in confusion and loss of important information regarding
  each individual food item.'
