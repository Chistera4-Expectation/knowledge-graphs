text: No, 'Flavored Water' and 'Hard Water' should not be merged together as they
  are distinct types of water with different properties and characteristics. Flavored
  Water typically refers to water infused with natural or artificial flavors, while
  Hard Water refers to water with a high mineral content, primarily calcium and magnesium.
  These are separate concepts and should not be combined as semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
