text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Fresh herbs' and 'Fresh
  parsley' are edible vegetables, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  'Fresh herbs' is a general term that encompasses a wide variety of herbs, including
  parsley. 'Fresh parsley' is a specific type of herb within the broader category
  of 'Fresh herbs'. They have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking,
  so they should remain separate instances in the class.
