text: No, Coconut water and Flavored Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are fluids that can be consumed as a beverage,
  they have different compositions and properties. Coconut water is a natural liquid
  found in young coconuts, while flavored water is plain water with added flavorings,
  often artificial. They serve different purposes and may have different dietary considerations,
  so they should be kept as separate instances in a drinking water class.
