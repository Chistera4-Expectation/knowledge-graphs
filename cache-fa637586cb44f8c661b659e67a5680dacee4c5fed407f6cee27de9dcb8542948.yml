text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both duck gizzards and ostrich gizzards are derived from poultry and are technically
  gizzards, they are distinct food items with different nutritional profiles, flavors,
  and textures due to the differences in the birds they come from. Therefore, they
  should be treated as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
