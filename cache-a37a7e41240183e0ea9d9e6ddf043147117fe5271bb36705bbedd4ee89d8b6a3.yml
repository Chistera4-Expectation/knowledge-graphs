text: No, Inari sushi and sushi-grade fish should not be merged together as they are
  different entities within the Edible Fish class. Inari sushi refers to a type of
  sushi made with fried tofu pouches, while sushi-grade fish refers to fish suitable
  for raw consumption in sushi dishes. While they are related, they represent distinct
  concepts within the context of fish and sushi.
