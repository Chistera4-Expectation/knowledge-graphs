  Dark soy sauce and optional dipping sauce do not refer to the same thing and therefore
  should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Dark soy sauce is a
  type of soy sauce that has been aged for a longer period of time, resulting in a
  thicker consistency and darker color than other types of soy sauce. It is used primarily
  for cooking and adding depth of flavor to dishes. Optional dipping sauce, on the
  other hand, refers to any type of sauce that can be served alongside food for dipping
  purposes. This could include various regional and cultural sauces such as tzatziki,
  hummus, salsa, aioli, etc., but it does not specifically refer to dark soy sauce.'
