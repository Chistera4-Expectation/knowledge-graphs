  In the context of nutrition and dietetics, "flour tortillas" and "wheat flour" are
  not considered duplicate instances. Flour tortillas are a type of food product made
  from wheat flour, but they have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking.
  Wheat flour is a raw ingredient, while flour tortillas are a processed food item.
  Therefore, it is beneficial to keep them separate in the Bread class to ensure accurate
  information and clarity for users.'
