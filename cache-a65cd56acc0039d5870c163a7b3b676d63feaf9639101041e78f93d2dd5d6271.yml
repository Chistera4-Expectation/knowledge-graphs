text: ' No. While idli rice (also known as idli rava) and regular rice are both types
  of rice, they have different properties and uses in cooking. Idli rice is partially
  milled and has a coarse texture, making it suitable for steamed cakes called idlis,
  whereas regular rice can refer to various kinds of whole grain rice used in many
  other dishes. Therefore, they shouldn''t be treated as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
