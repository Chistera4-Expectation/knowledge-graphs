text: No, "Pork Schnitzel" and "salt pork" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from pork, they are distinct dishes
  with different ingredients, preparation methods, and uses. Pork Schnitzel is a breaded
  and fried cutlet, typically made from pork loin or pork cutlet, while salt pork
  is a cured and salted pork product that is often used as a seasoning or flavoring
  in other dishes.
