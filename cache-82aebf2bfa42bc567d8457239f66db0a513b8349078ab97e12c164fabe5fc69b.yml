  As a dietitian, I can explain that while both buckwheat honey and orange blossom
  honey are types of honey, they have different flavor profiles, textures, and potential
  health benefits. Buckwheat honey is known for its dark color and robust, molasses-like
  flavor, while orange blossom honey has a lighter color and a milder, floral taste.
  Additionally, buckwheat honey contains more antioxidants than orange blossom honey.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
