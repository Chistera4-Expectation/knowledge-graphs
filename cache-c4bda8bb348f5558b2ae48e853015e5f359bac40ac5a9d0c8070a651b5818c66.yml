text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Infused Tea and Oolong Tea
  are types of tea, they are distinct in their preparation and flavor profiles. Infused
  Tea refers to tea leaves or other plant materials that have been steeped in hot
  water, while Oolong Tea is a specific type of partially oxidized tea with its own
  unique taste and characteristics. Therefore, they should be treated as separate
  entities.
