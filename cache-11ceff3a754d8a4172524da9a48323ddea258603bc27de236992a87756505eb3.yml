  While both "Ostrich Eggs" and "Ostrich" are related to poultry, they represent different
  food items. "Ostrich Eggs" refer to the eggs produced by ostriches, which are a
  food source, while "Ostrich" refers to the meat derived from the ostrich bird itself.
  They should be kept as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
