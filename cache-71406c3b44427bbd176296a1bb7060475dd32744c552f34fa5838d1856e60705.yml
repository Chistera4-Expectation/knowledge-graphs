text: As a dietician, I would advise against merging 'Chicken Broth' and 'Turkey Broth'
  as they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. While they both belong to the
  Poultry-derived Food class and are broths, they are made from different types of
  poultry (chicken vs. turkey) and may have distinct nutritional profiles and flavor
  profiles. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances.
