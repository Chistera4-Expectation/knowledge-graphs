text: " No.\n\nWhile flaxseed oil and sesame oil are both types of edible vegetable\
  \ oils, they have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, culinary\
  \ uses, and chemical properties. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge\
  \ them as semantic and ontological duplicates.\n\nFlaxseed oil is rich in omega-3\
  \ fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), while sesame oil contains\
  \ higher amounts of monounsaturated fats and vitamin E. They also have different\
  \ smoke points and flavors, making them suitable for different cooking methods and\
  \ dishes. Flaxseed oil has a low smoke point and delicate flavor, so it is typically\
  \ used cold or added to foods after cooking, whereas sesame oil has a high smoke\
  \ point and strong flavor, making it ideal for stir-frying, saut\xE9ing, and other\
  \ high-heat cooking techniques."
