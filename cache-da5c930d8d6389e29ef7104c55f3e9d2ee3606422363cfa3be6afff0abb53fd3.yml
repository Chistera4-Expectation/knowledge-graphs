  While both cooked rice and idli rice can refer to prepared dishes made from rice,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Cooked rice typically refers to
  any type of rice that has been boiled or steamed until it is soft and edible, while
  "idli rice" specifically refers to parboiled rice that is used in the preparation
  of idlis, which are a type of savory rice cake popular in South Indian cuisine.
  These two concepts have different meanings and uses in cooking and nutrition, so
  they should not be merged together.'
