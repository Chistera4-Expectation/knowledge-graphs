text: ' No. While both Lemon Juice Dressing and Olive Oil Dressing may contain olive
  oil as an ingredient in some variations, they are distinct food items due to their
  primary components (lemon juice for Lemon Juice Dressing and olive oil for Olive
  Oil Dressing). Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
