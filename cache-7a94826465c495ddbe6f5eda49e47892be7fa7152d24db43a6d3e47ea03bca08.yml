text: ' No. Cream cheese and serving size of cream cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates because they refer to different concepts. Cream cheese is a type of cheese
  with its own specific characteristics and properties, while serving size refers
  to the amount of that food item (in this case, cream cheese) being consumed. They
  belong to different levels of abstraction and serve distinct purposes in describing
  and categorizing food items.'
