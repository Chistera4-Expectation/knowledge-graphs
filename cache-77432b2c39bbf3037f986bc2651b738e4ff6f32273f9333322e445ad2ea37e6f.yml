text: ' No. While flaxseeds and sesame seeds have some similarities (for example,
  they are both sources of fiber and healthy fats), they also have important differences
  in terms of their nutritional profiles and potential health benefits. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to treat them as separate entities rather than merging them as
  duplicates. Additionally, from an ontological perspective, flaxseeds and sesame
  seeds belong to different biological families and have distinct physical properties,
  which further supports the argument for keeping them as separate concepts.'
