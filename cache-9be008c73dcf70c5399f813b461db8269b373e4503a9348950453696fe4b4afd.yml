  While both "diced onion" and "fried onions" are types of prepared onions, they have
  different nutritional profiles due to the cooking process involved with frying.
  Similarly, "boiled eggs" and "nuts" do not fall under the category of edible vegetables
  and have their own unique nutritional properties. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
