text: ' No. While cayenne pepper and habanero peppers are both types of chili peppers
  and share some similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of their flavor
  profile, heat level, appearance, and culinary uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
