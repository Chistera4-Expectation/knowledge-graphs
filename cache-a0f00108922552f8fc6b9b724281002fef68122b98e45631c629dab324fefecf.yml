  Although they are related, 'Ginger' and 'grated ginger' have distinct properties
  and uses in food preparation. 'Ginger' refers to the root of the ginger plant, while
  'grated ginger' specifically describes the form in which ginger is used as an ingredient
  or seasoning in recipes. They are not duplicates but rather different instances
  of the same ingredient in different forms.
