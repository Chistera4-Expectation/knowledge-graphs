text: " \"Dairy\" would be the most appropriate broad class for condensed milk, as\
  \ it is made from cow\u2019s milk. While butter, cheese, and yogurt are also dairy\
  \ products, they have different nutritional profiles due to varying processing methods.\
  \ However, if we need to choose just one option from that list, I would say 'Milk'\
  \ is the best fit as condensed milk is essentially sweetened and concentrated form\
  \ of regular milk."
