text: As a dietician, my focus is on the nutritional aspects and health benefits of
  food rather than semantic and ontological classifications. However, from a culinary
  perspective, red wine vinegar and white vinegar are not semantic or ontologic duplicates,
  as they have different flavors and acidity levels. Red wine vinegar has a more robust
  and complex flavor, while white vinegar has a sharper, more straightforward taste.
  Therefore, they serve different purposes in cooking and are not interchangeable
  in all recipes.
