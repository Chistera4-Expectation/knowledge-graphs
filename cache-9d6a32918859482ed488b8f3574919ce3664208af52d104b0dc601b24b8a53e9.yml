text: ' No. While both "Cheese" and "Feta Cheese" are types of cheese, they represent
  distinct concepts within the domain of food and nutrition. Feta cheese is a specific
  type of cheese that has its own unique characteristics, production methods, and
  nutritional profile. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
