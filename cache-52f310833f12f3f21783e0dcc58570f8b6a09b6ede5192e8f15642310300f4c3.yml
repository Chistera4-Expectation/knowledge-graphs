text: No, Lavender Honey and Manuka Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have distinct
  properties, flavors, and origins. Lavender Honey comes from bees that have collected
  nectar from lavender flowers, while Manuka Honey comes from bees that have collected
  nectar from the Manuka tree in New Zealand. These differences make them separate
  entities in terms of classification and description.
