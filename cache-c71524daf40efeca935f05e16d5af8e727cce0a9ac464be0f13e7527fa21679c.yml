text: As a dietician, I would suggest that 'Fried onions' and 'Onion' should not be
  merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the same
  class, 'Edible Vegetable,' they are different entities with distinct nutritional
  profiles and preparation methods. 'Onion' is a raw vegetable, whereas 'Fried onions'
  have been processed and cooked, which can alter their nutritional content and properties.
