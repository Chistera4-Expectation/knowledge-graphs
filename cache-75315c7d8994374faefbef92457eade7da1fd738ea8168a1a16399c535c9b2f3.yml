text: ' No. Coconut oil and walnut oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils, they have different
  nutritional profiles and uses due to their unique chemical compositions. Therefore,
  it is important to maintain them as separate entities with distinct properties.'
