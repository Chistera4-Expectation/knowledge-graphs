text: No, Flaxseed Oil and Sesame Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different
  nutritional profiles, uses, and origins. Flaxseed Oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids,
  while Sesame Oil is high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. They are distinct
  oils with unique properties and should be treated as separate entities.
