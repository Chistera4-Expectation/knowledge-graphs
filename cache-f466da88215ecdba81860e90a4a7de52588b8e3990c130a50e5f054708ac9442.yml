text: No, the instances 'King Oyster Mushroom' and 'Shiitake mushrooms' should not
  be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the
  Edible Mushrooms class, they are distinct species with unique characteristics and
  properties. Merging them would lead to a loss of specific information and potentially
  cause confusion.
