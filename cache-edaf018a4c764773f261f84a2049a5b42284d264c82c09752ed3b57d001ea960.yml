text: No, the instances 'Guinea Fowl Gravy' and 'Guinea Fowl Meat' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from the same
  bird, they represent different food items with distinct nutritional compositions
  and uses in cooking. Guinea Fowl Meat refers to the muscle tissue of the bird, while
  Guinea Fowl Gravy is a liquid condiment made from the drippings of the cooked meat.
