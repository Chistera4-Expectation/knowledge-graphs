text: No, "Basil leaves" and "Lotus Leaf" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both leaves from edible plants, they
  have different botanical origins, nutritional profiles, and uses in cuisine. They
  should remain as separate instances within the Edible Vegetable class.
