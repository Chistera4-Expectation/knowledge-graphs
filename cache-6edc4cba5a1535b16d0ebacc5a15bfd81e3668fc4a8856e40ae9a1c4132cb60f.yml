text: No, Greek Yogurt and Lassi Yogurt should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates because they are different types of yogurt with distinct
  characteristics and preparation methods. Greek Yogurt is strained yogurt that is
  thicker and creamier than regular yogurt, while Lassi Yogurt is a traditional Indian
  drink made from yogurt, water, and various flavorings. Although both are types of
  yogurt, they have distinct differences in their uses and preparation.
