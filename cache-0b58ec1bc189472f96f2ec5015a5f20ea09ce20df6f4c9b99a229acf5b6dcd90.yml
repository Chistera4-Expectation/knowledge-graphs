text: No, Peanuts and Pine nuts should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both seeds, they belong to different plant families
  and have distinct nutritional profiles. Peanuts are legumes, while pine nuts are
  seeds from pine trees. They have different nutrient compositions, allergens, and
  culinary uses. Merging them would not accurately represent the distinct characteristics
  of each seed.
