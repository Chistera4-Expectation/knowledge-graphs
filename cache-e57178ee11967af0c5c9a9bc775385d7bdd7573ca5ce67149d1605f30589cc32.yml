  Buckwheat honey and comb honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates, although
  they can both fall under the broader category of "honey." Buckwheat honey is a type
  of honey that is made from the nectar of buckwheat flowers, while comb honey refers
  to honey that still contains the wax combs built by honeybees. They have different
  tastes, textures, nutritional profiles, and production methods, so it would not
  be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
