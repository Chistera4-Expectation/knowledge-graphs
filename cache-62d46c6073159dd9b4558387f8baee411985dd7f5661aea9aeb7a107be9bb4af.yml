text: Yes, as a dietician, I can confirm that 'Crawfish' and 'Crayfish' are semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They both refer to the same species of freshwater crustaceans,
  also known as Astacidae or Astacoidea. The two terms are often used interchangeably,
  with 'crayfish' being more common in British English and 'crawfish' in American
  English.
