  Red onions are a type of vegetable that is commonly consumed in various dishes and
  cuisines around the world. They belong to the Allium family, which also includes
  garlic, shallots, leeks, and chives. Red onions have a milder flavor than white
  or yellow onions and are often used raw in salads or cooked in soups, stews, and
  stir-fries. Adding red onions to your meals can provide numerous health benefits
  as they are low in calories but high in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.'
