text: No, they should not be merged. While both are types of bread, they have different
  characteristics and uses. Gluten-Free Bread is specifically formulated for those
  with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, while Pita Bread is a type of flatbread
  commonly used in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine. These differences make
  them distinct entities within the Bread class.
