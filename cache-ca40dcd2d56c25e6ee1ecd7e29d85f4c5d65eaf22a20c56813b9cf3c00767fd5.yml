text: ' It is difficult to determine the most adequate class for "Filling" based on
  the given list as some items are food groups and others are specific foods or beverages.
  However, if we assume that the goal is to find food items that provide a significant
  amount of energy (calories) per serving, then the following classes could be considered
  filling: Beef, Cheese, Edible Fish, Pork-derived Food, Poultry-derived Food, Rice,
  and Pastas types. These foods are generally high in protein and complex carbohydrates
  which can help keep you feeling full for longer periods of time. Other options like
  Energy Drinks, Juice, Milk, Yogurt, and Honey also contain calories but may not
  necessarily keep you feeling full for long due to their simple sugar content.'
