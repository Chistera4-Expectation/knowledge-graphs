  Although both "the amount of sugar in the juice per serving" and "lime juice" may
  be related to each other in certain contexts (such as discussing the nutritional
  content of lime juice), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantic
  duplicates refer to pieces of information that have the same meaning, while ontological
  duplicates refer to entities that represent the same real-world object or concept.


  In this case, "the amount of sugar in the juice per serving" is a quantitative measurement,
  whereas "lime juice" refers to a specific type of fruit juice. Therefore, they do
  not convey the same meaning and cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
