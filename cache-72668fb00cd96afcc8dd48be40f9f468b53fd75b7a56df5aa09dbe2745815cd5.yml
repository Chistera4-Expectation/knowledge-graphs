text: No, the instances 'Tortilla' and 'flour tortillas' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of tortillas,
  they are not the same. 'Tortilla' is a general term for a type of flatbread, while
  'flour tortillas' specifically refers to tortillas made from wheat flour. There
  can be other types of tortillas, such as corn tortillas, so it's essential to differentiate
  between them in the Bread class.
