text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both "Turkey Patties" and "Turkey"
  are derived from poultry, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. "Turkey"
  refers to the whole bird, while "Turkey Patties" are a specific form of ground turkey
  that is shaped into patties. They have different nutritional profiles and are prepared
  differently, so they should be considered distinct instances in a dietary classification
  system.
