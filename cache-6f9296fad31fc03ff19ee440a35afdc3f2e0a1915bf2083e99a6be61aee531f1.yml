text: No, Almond Milk and Cow's Milk should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates because they are different types of milk with distinct nutritional profiles
  and origins. Almond Milk is a plant-based milk made from almonds, while Cow's Milk
  is an animal-based milk produced by cows. They are not interchangeable and serve
  different dietary needs and preferences.
