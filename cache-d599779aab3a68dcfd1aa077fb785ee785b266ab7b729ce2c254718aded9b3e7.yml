  While both crabs and imitation crab meat can belong to the broader category of edible
  crustaceans, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. A crab is a marine
  crustacean with a thick shell that typically has ten legs, while imitation crab
  meat is a type of processed seafood product made from various ingredients such as
  surimi (minced fish), starch, sugar, egg whites, and sometimes contains small amounts
  of real crab meat. They have different nutritional profiles and properties, so it
  would not be appropriate to merge them as identical entities.'
