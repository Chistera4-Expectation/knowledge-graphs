text: ' No. Although red chili powder and red pepper flakes may both be made from
  types of chili peppers and used to add heat to dishes, they are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates. Red chili powder is typically made by grinding dried whole
  chilies into a fine powder, while red pepper flakes consist of small pieces of dried
  chilies that have been crushed or broken apart. These differences in preparation
  result in different textures, flavors, and uses for each ingredient, making them
  distinct entities within their culinary contexts.'
