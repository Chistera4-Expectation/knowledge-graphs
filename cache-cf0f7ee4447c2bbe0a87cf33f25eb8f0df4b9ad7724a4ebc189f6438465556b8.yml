text: No, "Eggs" and "Pheasant Eggs" should not be merged as they are not semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are eggs derived from birds, they come from
  different species with potentially different nutritional compositions and culinary
  applications. Merging them would not accurately represent the distinct characteristics
  of each food item.
