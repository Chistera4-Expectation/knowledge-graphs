  The two flours have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking, so they
  should not be considered duplicates. All-purpose flour is made from wheat and is
  a common all-around flour for baking bread, cakes, and pastries, while buckwheat
  flour is made from ground buckwheat and has a distinct flavor and texture that works
  well in gluten-free recipes. They are not interchangeable in most recipes, and their
  differences make them unique and valuable in different contexts.'
