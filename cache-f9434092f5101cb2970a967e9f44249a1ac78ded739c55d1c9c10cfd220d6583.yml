text: As a dietician, I can provide my perspective on the classification of foods,
  but the decision ultimately lies with the developers of the Bread class. From a
  dietary standpoint, Focaccia Bread and French Bread are distinct types of bread
  with different ingredients and preparation methods. Therefore, it would be beneficial
  to keep them as separate instances within the Bread class to maintain accurate and
  specific information about each type of bread. However, if the decision is made
  to merge them as semantic and ontologic duplicates, it would be important to ensure
  that any relevant information is preserved and properly represented in the combined
  instance.
