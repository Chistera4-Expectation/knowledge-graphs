text: No, Hype Energy and Monster Energy should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the category of energy drinks,
  they are distinct brands with unique product offerings, marketing strategies, and
  target audiences. Merging them together would not accurately represent the variety
  of energy drinks available in the market.
