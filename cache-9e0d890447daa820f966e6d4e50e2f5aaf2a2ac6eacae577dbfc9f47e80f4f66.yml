text: ' No. While "Fresh Mozzarella Cheese" is a type of cheese, it is not a semantic
  duplicate of the more general term "Name of the cheese." A semantic duplicate refers
  to two terms that have the same meaning, but this is not the case here. Fresh mozzarella
  has its own unique characteristics and does not encompass all types of cheeses.
  Therefore, these two instances should remain separate.'
