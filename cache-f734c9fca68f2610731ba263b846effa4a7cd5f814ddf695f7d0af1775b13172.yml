  Brown rice and rice flour are not semantic and ontological duplicates, even though
  they both come from rice. They have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking,
  so it is important to keep them separate when discussing rice in a dietary context.
  Brown rice is a whole grain that still has the bran and germ intact, making it more
  nutritious than white rice but also chewier and nuttier in flavor. On the other
  hand, rice flour is made by grinding brown or white rice into a fine powder, which
  can then be used as a gluten-free alternative to wheat flour for baking and thickening
  sauces. Therefore, keeping these two terms distinct is useful for accurate communication
  about food and nutrition.'
