text: No, Blueberry and Strawberry should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both edible fruits, they are distinct species with unique
  characteristics, nutritional profiles, and botanical classifications. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the individuality of each fruit in a classification
  system.
