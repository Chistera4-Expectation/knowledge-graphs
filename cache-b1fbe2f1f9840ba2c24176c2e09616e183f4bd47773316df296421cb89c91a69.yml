  Rice bran oil and vegetable oil for frying are different products with distinct
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking, so they should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Rice bran oil is a light, nutty oil that is high in
  unsaturated fats and antioxidants, while vegetable oil for frying is typically a
  blend of various oils that is designed for high-heat cooking and has a more neutral
  flavor.'
