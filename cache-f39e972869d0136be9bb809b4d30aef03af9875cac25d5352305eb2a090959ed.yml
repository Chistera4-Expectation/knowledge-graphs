  While "Blueberry Honey" and "Eucalyptus Honey" both fall under the category of honey,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinctly different
  flavors, colors, and nutritional profiles due to the types of flowers their bees
  visit for nectar collection. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate categories
  for each type of specialty honey.'
