text: ' No. Barbecue sauce is one type of sauce, but it has its own specific ingredients
  and uses that make it distinct from other sauces. Therefore, barbecue sauce and
  sauce should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. It would be more
  appropriate to consider "sauce" as a broader category that includes many subcategories
  like barbecue sauce, tomato sauce, soy sauce, etc., each with their unique properties
  and purposes.'
