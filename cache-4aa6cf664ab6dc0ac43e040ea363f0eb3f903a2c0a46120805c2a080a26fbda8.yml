text: No, the instances 'Flaxseed Bread' and 'Sourdough Bread' should not be merged
  together as they are distinct types of bread with different ingredients, nutritional
  profiles, and preparation methods. While they both fall under the broader category
  of bread, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
