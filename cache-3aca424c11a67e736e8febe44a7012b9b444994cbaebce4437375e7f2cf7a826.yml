text: As a dietician, my answer is based on the nutritional and culinary aspects of
  the sauces. While Chimichurri sauce and Tomato sauce may share some similarities
  in their purpose as condiments or accompaniments, they have distinct ingredients
  and nutritional profiles. Chimichurri sauce is made from herbs, vinegar, and oil,
  while tomato sauce is primarily made from tomatoes and spices. Therefore, I would
  recommend not merging these instances as they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  They serve different purposes and have different nutritional values.
