text: No, Jasmine Rice and Wild Rice should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of rice with different properties and origins. Jasmine Rice is a long-grain
  variety originating from Thailand, while Wild Rice is a separate species native
  to North America. Although both are considered types of rice, they have different
  nutritional profiles, flavors, and cooking characteristics. Merging them together
  would lead to loss of important distinctions and information.
