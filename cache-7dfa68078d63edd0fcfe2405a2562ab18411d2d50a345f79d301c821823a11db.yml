text: ' No. Honey mustard dressing and tahini dressing are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, despite both being types of salad dressings. They have distinct ingredients
  (honey and mustard vs. sesame paste) and flavors (sweet and tangy vs. rich and nutty),
  making them unique food items that should not be merged together.'
