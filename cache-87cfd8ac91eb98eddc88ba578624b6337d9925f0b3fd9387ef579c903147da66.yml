text: No, 'Black peppercorns' and 'Red pepper flakes' should not be merged together
  as they are distinct spices with different properties and uses in cooking. While
  they both come from the pepper family, black peppercorns are whole, dried unripe
  berries, while red pepper flakes are a blend of dried and crushed red chili peppers.
