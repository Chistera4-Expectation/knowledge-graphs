text: No, Mineral Water and Soft Water should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are different types of drinking water with distinct characteristics.
  Mineral Water contains dissolved minerals and is naturally occurring, while Soft
  Water has fewer dissolved minerals and may be produced through a water softening
  process. Therefore, they should remain as separate instances.
