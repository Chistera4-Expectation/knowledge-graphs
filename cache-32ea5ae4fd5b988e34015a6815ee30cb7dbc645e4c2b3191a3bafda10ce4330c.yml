text: No, Manuka Honey and Raw Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are both types of honey, but they have distinct characteristics
  and properties. Manuka Honey is a specific type of honey produced in New Zealand
  and Australia from the nectar of the Manuka tree, which has unique antibacterial
  properties due to the presence of methylglyoxal. Raw Honey, on the other hand, refers
  to honey that has not been heated, pasteurized, or processed, and it may come from
  various floral sources. While both types of honey can have health benefits, they
  have different properties and should be treated as separate entities.
