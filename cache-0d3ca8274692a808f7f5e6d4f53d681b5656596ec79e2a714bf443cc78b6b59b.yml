text: No, the instances 'Blueberry Honey' and 'Linden Honey' should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of honey with different
  flavors and properties due to the specific flowers (blueberries and lindens) that
  the bees gather nectar from. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique
  characteristics of each type of honey.
