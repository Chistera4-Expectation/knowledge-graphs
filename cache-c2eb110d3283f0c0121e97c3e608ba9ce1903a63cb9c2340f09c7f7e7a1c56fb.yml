  Although Arborio rice and sushi rice can both be classified under the general category
  of "rice," they have distinct properties that make them more suitable for different
  dishes. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.


  Arborio rice has high starch content and is known for its creamy texture when cooked,
  making it ideal for risotto and other Italian rice dishes. On the other hand, sushi
  rice has a stickier consistency due to its lower amylose content, which makes it
  perfect for rolling and shaping into sushi rolls.


  Merging these two types of rice would overlook their unique characteristics and
  potential applications in various recipes. As such, maintaining separate categories
  for Arborio rice and sushi rice helps ensure accurate information sharing about
  each type''s culinary uses and nutritional profiles.'
