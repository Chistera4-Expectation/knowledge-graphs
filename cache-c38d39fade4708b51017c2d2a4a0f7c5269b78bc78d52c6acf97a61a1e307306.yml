text: ' No. While both "saturated fat per serving" and "sodium per serving" are related
  to nutrition and health, they refer to different nutritional components with distinct
  effects on the body. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. It is important to keep track of both values separately
  for a comprehensive understanding of a cheese''s nutritional profile.'
