text: No, they should not be merged. While both are types of butter, they have distinct
  characteristics that differentiate them. Clarified butter is butter that has had
  the milk solids and water removed, resulting in a higher smoke point and longer
  shelf life. Unsalted butter is simply butter without added salt, which can be useful
  in recipes where precise control over salt content is desired. Merging them would
  lose this important distinction.
