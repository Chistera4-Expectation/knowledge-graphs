text: No, Chamomile Tea and Infused Tea should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of tea, they have distinct characteristics
  and flavors. Chamomile Tea is made from the dried flowers of the chamomile plant
  and has a distinct floral taste, whereas Infused Tea refers to any tea that has
  been infused with additional flavors or ingredients, which can vary greatly and
  include Chamomile Tea as one of the options.
