  While both chicken wings and rotisserie chicken are types of poultry-derived food,
  they have distinct characteristics that make them non-duplicate entities from a
  semantic and ontological perspective. Chicken wings typically refer to a specific
  cut of meat from a chicken, while rotisserie chicken refers to a cooking method
  for an entire chicken. Therefore, it is appropriate to maintain these two terms
  as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.'
