text: No, Arborio Rice and Black Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct properties and uses.
  Arborio Rice is an Italian short-grain rice commonly used for risotto, while Black
  Rice, also known as Forbidden Rice, is a whole grain rice with a distinct nutty
  flavor and dark color, often used in Asian cuisine. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the unique characteristics of each type of rice.
