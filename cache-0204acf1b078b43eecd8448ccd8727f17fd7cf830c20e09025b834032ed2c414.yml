  While both "lean beef" and "organic beef" are types of beef, they refer to different
  qualities of beef that are not interchangeable. Lean beef refers to cuts with less
  marbling and lower fat content, while organic beef is raised according to specific
  standards related to animal welfare, feeding practices, and use of antibiotics and
  hormones. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
