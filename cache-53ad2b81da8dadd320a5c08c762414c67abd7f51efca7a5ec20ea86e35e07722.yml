  While both Caesar dressing and creamy garlic dressing may share some similar characteristics
  (such as being creamy), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they have distinct ingredients and flavors. Caesar dressing typically includes anchovies,
  Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and egg yolk, while creamy garlic dressing is
  characterized by its use of garlic and heavy cream or sour cream. Therefore, it
  would be incorrect to merge these two instances as they represent different food
  items with unique tastes and compositions.'
