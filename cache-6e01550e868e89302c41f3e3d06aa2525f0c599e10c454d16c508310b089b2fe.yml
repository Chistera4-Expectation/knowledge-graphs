  Although both Orange Blossom Honey and Tupelo Honey are types of honey, they have
  distinct differences in terms of their flavor profile, geographical origin, and
  flower nectar source. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Here is some more information about each type:


  * Orange Blossom Honey: This variety of honey has a light color and mildly sweet
  taste with citrus undertones. It is made from the nectar of orange blossoms primarily
  in Florida, California, and parts of Texas, Arizona, and Mexico. The unique flavor
  comes from the essential oils found in the orange blossoms.

  * Tupelo Honey: Known for its rich amber color and buttery smooth texture, Tupelo
  Honey is considered one of the finest honeys available due to its complex caramel-like
  flavor with hints of apricot and fig. Produced mainly in northwest Florida along
  the Apalachicola River and surrounding areas, this rare honey is derived from the
  nectar of tupelo trees (Nyssa ogeche) that grow exclusively in swampy wetlands.


  Merging these two varieties into one category would disregard the specific characteristics
  and production methods associated with each kind of honey.'
