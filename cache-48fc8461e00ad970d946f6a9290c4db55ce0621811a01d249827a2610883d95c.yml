text: No, 'Buckwheat Honey' and 'Raw Honey' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of honey, they have distinct characteristics
  and properties that differentiate them. Buckwheat honey is a specific type of honey
  derived from the nectar of buckwheat flowers, while raw honey refers to honey that
  has not been pasteurized or processed. They both belong to the broader category
  of honey but serve different purposes and have unique nutritional and flavor profiles.
