text: 'No, the instances "Non-Dairy Yogurt" and "Savory Yogurt" should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They represent different characteristics of
  yogurt: one is a type of yogurt based on its ingredients (non-dairy), while the
  other is based on flavor profile (savory). These are distinct properties that should
  be kept separate.'
