text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Quail Eggs
  and Quail Patties are two distinct types of food derived from quails. Quail Eggs
  are the eggs themselves, while Quail Patties are made from ground quail meat and
  typically contain other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs or spices. These are separate
  food items and should be treated as such in a Poultry-derived Food class.
