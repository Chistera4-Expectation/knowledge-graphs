text: No, "Quail Tenders" and "Turkey Tenders" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from poultry and may have similarities
  in terms of preparation and usage, they are distinct types of meat from different
  birds. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between these
  two food items.
