text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are derived from poultry, specifically
  chicken, they are different parts of the animal with distinct nutritional profiles
  and culinary uses. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are primarily a lean source
  of protein, while chicken liver is a rich source of iron, vitamin A, and other nutrients.
  Merging them would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
