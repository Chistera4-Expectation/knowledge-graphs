text: As a dietician, my answer is no. While both short-grain rice and steamed white
  rice are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics and uses. Short-grain
  rice has a higher starch content, making it stickier when cooked, and it is often
  used in dishes like sushi or risotto. Steamed white rice, on the other hand, has
  a lower starch content and is commonly used as a side dish for meals. Although they
  both fall under the category of rice, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates
  due to their differences in texture and usage.
