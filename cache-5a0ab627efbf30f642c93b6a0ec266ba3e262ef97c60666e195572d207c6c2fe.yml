  While both chili oil and sunflower oil are types of edible oils, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they have different physical properties, origins,
  and uses. Chili oil is typically made from vegetable oils (such as soybean or sesame)
  infused with chili peppers, garlic, or other spices, resulting in a flavorful and
  spicy condiment used primarily for seasoning dishes. On the other hand, sunflower
  oil is extracted directly from sunflower seeds and has a milder taste. It is commonly
  used for cooking due to its high smoke point and nutritional benefits. Therefore,
  these two oils serve distinct purposes in culinary applications.'
