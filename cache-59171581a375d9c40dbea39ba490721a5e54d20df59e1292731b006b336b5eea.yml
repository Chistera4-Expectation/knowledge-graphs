  Crimini mushrooms and sliced shiitake mushrooms are two different types of mushrooms
  with distinct characteristics, flavors, and textures. While they share some similarities,
  they are not interchangeable and can be used in different recipes and dishes. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
