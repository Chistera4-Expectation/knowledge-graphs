text: As a dietician, I would say no, 'Clover Honey' and 'Pine Honey' should not be
  merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the category
  of honey, they are derived from different plant sources (clover and pine trees,
  respectively) and have distinct flavor profiles and properties. Therefore, they
  should be treated as separate entities within the honey class.
