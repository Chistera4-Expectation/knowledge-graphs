  While red chili powder and turmeric powder may both be considered spices and could
  potentially have some overlapping properties, they are not semantic nor ontological
  duplicates because they are distinctly different ingredients with unique flavors,
  appearances, and nutritional profiles. Red chili powder is made from dried ground
  chilies and has a hot, spicy flavor, while turmeric powder comes from the rhizome
  of the Curcuma longa plant and imparts an earthy, slightly bitter taste along with
  its characteristic bright yellow color. Merging them would result in loss of important
  distinctions between these two separate food items.'
