text: As a dietician, I can provide input on the nutritional aspects of bread but
  not on the specifics of programming or ontology. However, from a food perspective,
  'Tortilla' and 'Tortillas' generally refer to the same food item (a thin, round
  flatbread). So, in the context of a food classification system, they could be considered
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. But as a dietician, I would still consider them
  as separate instances when providing nutritional information or discussing recipes
  that use either tortilla or tortillas.
