  While both "Mango chutney" and "Spicy mango salsa" are condiments made from mangoes,
  they have different flavor profiles and textures, with chutneys being generally
  thicker and more sweet than salsas. Additionally, their spice levels and ingredient
  combinations can vary greatly, making them distinct culinary entities. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
