text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Clarified
  butter and lactose-free butter have different characteristics and properties. Clarified
  butter is made by heating and separating the milk solids and water from butterfat,
  resulting in a higher smoke point and longer shelf life. Lactose-free butter is
  made by removing lactose, the sugar found in milk, making it suitable for those
  with lactose intolerance. While both are types of butter, they serve different purposes
  and cater to different dietary needs.
