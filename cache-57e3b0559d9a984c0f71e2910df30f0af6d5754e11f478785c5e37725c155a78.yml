text: ' No. Although brown rice and wild rice have similar nutritional profiles and
  health benefits, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. Brown rice is
  a type of whole grain rice that has had its hull removed, while wild rice is a grass
  seed that is unrelated to rice but gets its name due to its resemblance to Asian
  rice species. They come from different botanical sources (Oryza sativa for brown
  rice and Zizania spp. for wild rice) and possess unique flavors, textures, and culinary
  uses. Therefore, it would not be accurate or appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
