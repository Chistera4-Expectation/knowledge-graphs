text: No, Quail Soup and Quail Stock are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Quail Soup is a complete dish made from quail meat and other ingredients, while
  Quail Stock is a concentrated liquid made from simmering quail bones, vegetables,
  and herbs, which is typically used as a base for soups and sauces. Although they
  share some ingredients and preparation steps, they serve different purposes and
  should not be merged.
