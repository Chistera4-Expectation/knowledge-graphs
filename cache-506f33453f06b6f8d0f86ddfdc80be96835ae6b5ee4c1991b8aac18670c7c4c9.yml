text: ' No. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) and sodium nitrite are two different compounds
  with distinct chemical structures, functions, and effects on food. MSG is a flavor
  enhancer that amplifies umami taste, while sodium nitrite is a preservative used
  to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage in processed meats. They have different
  safety profiles and potential health impacts, so they should not be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
