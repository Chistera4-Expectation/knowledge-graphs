text: No, the instances 'Infused Tea' and 'Rooibos Tea' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are types of tea, they are distinct
  and have unique characteristics. Infused tea refers to any tea made by steeping
  various ingredients, such as herbs, spices, or fruits, in hot water. Rooibos tea,
  on the other hand, is a specific type of tea made from the leaves of the Aspalathus
  linearis plant, native to South Africa. Each has its own flavor profile, preparation
  methods, and nutritional properties.
