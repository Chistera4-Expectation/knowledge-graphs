text: ' No. While red onions are a type of onion, they have distinct characteristics
  that set them apart from other types of onions, such as white onions or yellow onions.
  Therefore, it is appropriate to keep "onions" and "red onions" as separate entities
  within the edible vegetable class. This allows for more specificity when discussing
  their unique nutritional profiles, flavors, and culinary uses.'
