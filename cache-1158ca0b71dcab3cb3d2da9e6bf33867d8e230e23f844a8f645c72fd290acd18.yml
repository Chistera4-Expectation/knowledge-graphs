text: No, Brown Rice and Wild Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct properties, nutritional
  profiles, and culinary uses. Brown Rice is a whole grain with the outer bran layer
  intact, while Wild Rice is a seed of an aquatic grass that is not a true rice. They
  can be classified together as types of rice, but they should not be merged as duplicates
  due to their unique characteristics.
