  While "Creamy Garlic Dressing" and "Honey Mustard Dressing" may have some similarities
  (e.g., both are types of salad dressings), they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they contain different ingredients and possess distinct flavor
  profiles. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate within the context
  of a food dressing class.'
