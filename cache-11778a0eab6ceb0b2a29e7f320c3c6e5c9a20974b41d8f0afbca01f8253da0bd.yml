text: No, the instances 'Chicken Breast' and 'chicken/vegetable stock' should not
  be merged as they represent different food items. Chicken Breast is a cut of meat
  from a chicken, while chicken/vegetable stock is a liquid made by simmering chicken
  and vegetable ingredients. They have distinct nutritional profiles and uses in recipes.
