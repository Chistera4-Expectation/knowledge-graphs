text: ' The most adequate class for "Chopped onions" would be "Edible Vegetables."
  This is because onions are vegetables, and they are typically classified as such
  in culinary contexts. While onions can certainly be used in conjunction with many
  of the other classes listed (such as being an ingredient in a sauce or food seasoning),
  they are not themselves a member of those categories.'
