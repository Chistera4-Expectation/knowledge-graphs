text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Artisanal Water' and 'Glacier Water' are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  characteristics and sources. Artisanal water typically refers to water collected
  from natural springs or wells, while glacier water comes from melting glaciers.
  These differences warrant separate classifications in a drinking water ontology.
