text: " The most adequate class for Haddock is \"Edible Fish\". Haddock is a type\
  \ of seafood that belongs to the family of Gadidae and is a popular choice in many\
  \ culinary traditions. It is rich in protein, vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty\
  \ acids, making it a healthy option for those looking to incorporate more fish into\
  \ their diets. Compared to edible crustaceans (such as shrimp or lobster) and edible\
  \ mollusks (such as clams or oysters), haddock is a type of whitefish with mild\
  \ flavor and firm texture, which makes it versatile in various cooking methods such\
  \ as baking, grilling, broiling, saut\xE9ing, steaming, poaching, or deep-frying."
