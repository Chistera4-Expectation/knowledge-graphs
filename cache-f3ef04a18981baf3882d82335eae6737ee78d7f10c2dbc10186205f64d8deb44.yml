text: No, Turkey Gizzards and Turkey Gravy should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are two distinct food items derived from turkey, with different
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Turkey Gizzards are a muscle found in
  the digestive tract of the bird, while Turkey Gravy is a sauce made from the drippings
  of cooked turkey meat.
