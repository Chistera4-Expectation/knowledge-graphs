text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  they both involve the use of pepper, they are different types of pepper with distinct
  flavors and uses. Ground white pepper has a more subtle and less spicy taste compared
  to regular black pepper (often referred to as just 'pepper'). Keeping them as separate
  instances in the Food Seasoning class allows for a more accurate representation
  of the variety of seasonings available.
