text: No, they should not be merged. 'Fish' is a general term for any aquatic vertebrate
  animal that is typically eaten, while 'Sushi-grade fish' refers specifically to
  fish that has been deemed safe for consumption in sushi dishes due to its freshness,
  handling, and preparation methods. The two terms are not semantically or ontologically
  equivalent.
