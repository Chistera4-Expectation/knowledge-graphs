text: Yes, in the context of a dietician's categorization, 'Leek' and 'Leeks' can
  be considered semantic and ontological duplicates since they refer to the same vegetable.
  However, it's essential to note that 'Leek' and 'Leeks' may have different grammatical
  uses in some contexts, such as in recipes or instructions.
