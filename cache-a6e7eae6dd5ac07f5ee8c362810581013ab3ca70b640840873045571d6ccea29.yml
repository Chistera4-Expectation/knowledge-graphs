text: ' No. Corned beef and pasture-raised beef are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They refer to different types of beef products with distinct preparation methods
  and characteristics. Corned beef is typically made from brisket that has been preserved
  through a process of salt curing, while pasture-raised beef refers to cattle that
  have been raised on open pastures and fed natural diets, resulting in potentially
  different nutritional profiles and flavor characteristics. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
