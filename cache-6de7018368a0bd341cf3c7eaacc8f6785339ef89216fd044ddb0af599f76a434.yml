text: No, Olive Oil and Walnut Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both types of edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  characteristics, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking and other applications.
  Therefore, they should be treated as separate entities within the classification
  system.
