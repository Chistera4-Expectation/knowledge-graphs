text: ' No. While chicken soup is made from chicken and therefore contains chicken,
  it also includes other ingredients such as broth, vegetables, and seasonings that
  significantly alter its nutritional profile compared to plain chicken meat. Therefore,
  they should not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates in the context
  of poultry-derived foods.'
