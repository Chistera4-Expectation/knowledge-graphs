text: ' No. Sesame oil and vegetable oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. Although sesame oil is a type of vegetable oil
  (since it is derived from plants), they have different nutritional profiles, tastes,
  and uses. Therefore, keeping them separate allows for more accurate and specific
  information about each type of oil.'
