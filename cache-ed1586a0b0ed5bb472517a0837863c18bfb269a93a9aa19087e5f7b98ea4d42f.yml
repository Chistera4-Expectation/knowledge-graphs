text: No, the instances 'Black Trumpet Mushroom' and 'Hen of the Woods Mushroom' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct
  species of edible mushrooms, with different appearances, flavors, and nutritional
  profiles. Black Trumpet Mushroom (Craterellus cornucopioides) is a trumpet-shaped,
  black mushroom, while Hen of the Woods Mushroom (Grifola frondosa) is a cluster
  of overlapping caps that resemble a chicken's ruffled feathers. Both are delicious
  and have their own unique culinary uses.
