text: No, Turkey Patties and Turkey Thighs should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from turkey, they are distinct
  cuts of meat with different nutritional profiles, preparation methods, and culinary
  applications. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
