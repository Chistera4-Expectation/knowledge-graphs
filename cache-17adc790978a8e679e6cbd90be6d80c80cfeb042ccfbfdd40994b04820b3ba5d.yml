text: No, 'Drinkable Yogurt' and 'Non-Dairy Yogurt' should not be merged together
  as they represent different types of yogurt. Drinkable yogurt refers to a yogurt
  that is liquid or drinkable, while non-dairy yogurt refers to a yogurt made from
  non-dairy milk alternatives like almond milk or soy milk. They can both be considered
  as subcategories of yogurt, but they have distinct characteristics and should be
  treated separately.
