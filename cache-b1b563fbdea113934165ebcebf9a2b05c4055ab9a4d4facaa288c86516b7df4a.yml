text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both are pork-derived foods, they have different nutritional profiles, preparation
  methods, and uses in culinary contexts. "Pork ribs" are primarily a protein source
  and are commonly consumed as a main course, while "salt pork" is typically used
  as a flavoring agent or a source of fat in various dishes. Merging them would not
  accurately reflect their distinct properties and uses.
