text: No, European-style Butter and Organic Butter should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they may share some characteristics, they are distinct
  types of butter with unique production methods and ingredients. European-style butter
  typically has a higher fat content and is made with cultured cream, while organic
  butter is made from certified organic ingredients.
