text: No, the instances 'Chicken Wings' and 'Chicken' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although both are derived from poultry,
  they are distinct food items with different nutritional profiles and cooking methods.
  'Chicken' refers to the entire bird, while 'Chicken Wings' refer to a specific part
  of the bird.
