text: No, they should not be merged together. Parboiled Rice and Sushi Rice are different
  types of rice with distinct processing methods and uses. Parboiled Rice is partially
  boiled in the husk before being dried, while Sushi Rice is a short-grain rice that
  is specifically prepared and seasoned for sushi. Merging them as duplicates would
  not accurately represent their unique properties and applications.
