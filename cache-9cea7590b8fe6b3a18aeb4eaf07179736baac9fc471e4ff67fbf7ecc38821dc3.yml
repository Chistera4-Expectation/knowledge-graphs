text: No, "Pheasant Soup" and "Quail Soup" should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they share similarities as poultry-derived soups, they are
  distinct dishes made from different types of poultry. They have unique flavors,
  textures, and nutritional profiles that set them apart from one another.
