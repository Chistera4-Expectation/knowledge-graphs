text: No, Morel Mushroom and Portobello Mushroom should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms, they are distinct
  species with different characteristics, flavors, and culinary uses. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the unique attributes of each mushroom.
