text: No, the instances 'Long-grain Rice' and 'Steamed white rice' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of rice, they
  differ in their characteristics, cooking methods, and applications. Long-grain rice
  has a lower starch content, resulting in individual grains that remain separate
  after cooking, making it suitable for dishes where rice is a side or accompaniment.
  Steamed white rice, on the other hand, is often cooked by steaming or boiling, resulting
  in softer, more cohesive grains, which make it ideal for dishes like sushi, fried
  rice, and rice bowls. Merging these two instances would not accurately reflect their
  unique properties and uses.
