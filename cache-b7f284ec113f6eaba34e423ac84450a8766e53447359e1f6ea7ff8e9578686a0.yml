text: ' No. Chicken pot pie and chicken tacos are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they both contain chicken and can therefore be classified under the same general
  category of poultry-derived foods, they have distinct ingredients, preparation methods,
  and cultural origins that make them unique dishes. Merging these two instances would
  result in the loss of important distinctions between them.'
