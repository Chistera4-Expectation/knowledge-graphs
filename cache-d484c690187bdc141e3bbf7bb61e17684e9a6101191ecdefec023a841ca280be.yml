text: No, "Ostrich Stock" and "Ostrich Thighs" should not be merged together as they
  are two different types of poultry-derived food products. Ostrich Stock refers to
  a liquid broth made from boiling ostrich bones and/or meat, while Ostrich Thighs
  refer to the actual meat from the thigh portion of an ostrich. They are distinct
  in their composition and use in cooking.
