text: No, these instances should not be merged together. They serve different purposes
  in the context of the Edible Vegetable class. 'Vegetables of your choice' refers
  to a variety of individual vegetables that a person can select for consumption,
  while 'vegetable stock' refers to a liquid made by boiling vegetables, which is
  used as a base for soups, sauces, and other dishes. They are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates.
