text: As a dietician, I would say that while both terms refer to fish suitable for
  raw consumption, they may have slight differences in quality and handling requirements.
  Therefore, it would be more appropriate to keep them as separate instances, as they
  serve different purposes and may be subject to different standards in the food industry.
  However, this decision ultimately depends on the specific context and goals of the
  classification system being used.
