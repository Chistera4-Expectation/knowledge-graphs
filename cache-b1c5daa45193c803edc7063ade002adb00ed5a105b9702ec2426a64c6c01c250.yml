  While ginger paste and miso paste are both types of pastes used for flavoring food,
  they have different ingredients, flavors, textures, uses, and cultural origins.
  Ginger paste is made primarily from fresh ginger root with some added ingredients
  like vinegar, oil, or water to make it into a smooth paste form. It has a spicy
  and pungent taste due to its high concentration of glycerol and other compounds
  present in raw ginger. On the other hand, Miso paste is a fermented soybean-based
  Japanese seasoning that can also include rice, barley, or other grains. Its flavor
  profile ranges from mildly sweet to savory umami taste depending on the type and
  duration of fermentation. Therefore, merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates
  would not accurately reflect their unique properties and applications in cooking.'
