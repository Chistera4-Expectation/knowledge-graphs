  While both fried chicken and rotisserie chicken are types of poultry-derived food,
  they have distinct preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is
  not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Fried chicken
  is typically deep-fried in oil, which adds calories and fat compared to rotisserie
  chicken, which is usually seasoned and slow-roasted without added fat. These differences
  can impact their suitability for various diets and health goals, so maintaining
  separate categories allows for more accurate information and recommendations.'
