  While both Chicken Pot Pie and Turkey may belong to the same general category of
  poultry-derived food, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have
  distinct ingredients, preparations, and cultural associations that make them unique
  from one another. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep these two instances separate.'
