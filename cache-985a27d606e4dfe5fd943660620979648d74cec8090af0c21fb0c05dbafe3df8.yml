text: No, 'Pheasant Meat' and 'Quail Meat' should not be merged together as they are
  different types of poultry-derived food with distinct nutritional profiles, flavors,
  and culinary uses. While they may share some similarities as poultry-derived foods,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
