  While both "how often an individual is drinking water throughout the day" and "ice
  water" are related to the topic of hydration and drinking water, they refer to different
  aspects of this topic. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.


  The first instance refers to the frequency of drinking water, which can have implications
  for overall health and hydration status. The second instance, "ice water," specifically
  refers to water that is chilled or frozen, which may have slightly different effects
  on hydration and satiety compared to room temperature water but does not encompass
  the broader concept of hydration frequency.'
