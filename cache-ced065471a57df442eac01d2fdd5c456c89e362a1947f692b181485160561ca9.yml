text: ' Among the given options, the most appropriate class for preservatives would
  be "Food Additives" or simply "Additives". Preservatives are substances added to
  food to maintain its quality and extend its shelf life. They can be found in various
  forms such as dressings, seasonings, sauces, spices, sweeteners, and other types
  of foods. However, the most comprehensive and accurate term for this category is
  additives because preservatives are just one type of food additive that serves a
  specific function (preservation).'
