text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they
  share some similarities, they are not the same. Short-grain rice refers to a type
  of rice with a higher starch content that becomes sticky when cooked. Sticky rice,
  also known as glutinous rice, is a specific variety of rice with a high amylopectin
  starch content that makes it very sticky when cooked. They are related but distinct
  categories of rice.
