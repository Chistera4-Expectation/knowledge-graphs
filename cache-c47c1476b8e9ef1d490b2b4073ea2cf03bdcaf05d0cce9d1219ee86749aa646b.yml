text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Dry white wine' and 'White
  wine' are types of alcoholic drinks, they have distinct characteristics. 'Dry white
  wine' specifically refers to white wine with low residual sugar, resulting in a
  dry taste, whereas 'White wine' can encompass a broader range of white wines, including
  those that are not dry. Therefore, they should be considered separate instances
  in the Alcoholic Drink class.
