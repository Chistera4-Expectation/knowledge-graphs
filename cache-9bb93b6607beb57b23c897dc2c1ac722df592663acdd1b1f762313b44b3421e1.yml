text: " No.\n\nWhile both \"Jalape\xF1o peppers\" and \"Peppers\" refer to types of\
  \ pepper plants, they are not identical in terms of their botanical classification,\
  \ culinary usage, and nutritional content. Jalape\xF1os are a specific variety of\
  \ Capsicum annuum that is characterized by its spicy flavor and heat level, whereas\
  \ \"Peppers\" can refer to several different species within the Solanaceae family,\
  \ including bell peppers (Capsicum annuum), chili peppers (Capsicum frutescens),\
  \ and sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum var. grossum). Therefore, it is appropriate\
  \ to keep them separate as distinct instances in the Edible Vegetable class."
