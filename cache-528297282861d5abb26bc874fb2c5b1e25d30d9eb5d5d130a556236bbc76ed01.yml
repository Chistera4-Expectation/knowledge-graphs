  Matcha tea and Pu-erh tea are two distinct types of tea with their own unique nutritional
  profiles and cultural associations. While they are both tea beverages, they differ
  in their composition, preparation methods, and health benefits. Merging them together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates would not accurately represent the distinctness
  of each tea variety.'
