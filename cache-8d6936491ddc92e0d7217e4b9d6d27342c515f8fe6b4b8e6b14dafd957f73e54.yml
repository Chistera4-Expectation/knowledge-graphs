text: ' I cannot definitively determine which of the given options, "Coffee" or "Tea,"
  is most appropriate as a class for a diuretic infusion without additional context.
  Both beverages contain natural compounds that can have diuretic effects, but their
  individual properties and concentrations vary significantly. For instance, coffee
  contains more caffeine and larger amounts of certain minerals like potassium and
  magnesium than tea, while tea contains higher levels of polyphenols and flavonoids
  known to contribute to its diuretic effect. Therefore, it would depend on specific
  research findings regarding each type''s diuretic potential in an infused form.
  A more accurate classification might include terms such as "Caffeinated Diuretic
  Infusions (coffee-based)" or "Herbal Diuretic Infusions (tea-based)".'
