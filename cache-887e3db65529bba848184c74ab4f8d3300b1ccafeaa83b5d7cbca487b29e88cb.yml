text: No, they should not be merged together. While they both fall under the category
  of coffee, they have distinct differences in terms of preparation, ingredients,
  and flavor profile. Drip coffee is made by dripping hot water over ground coffee
  beans, while Irish coffee is a cocktail that combines coffee, whiskey, sugar, and
  cream. These differences in composition and preparation make them distinct entities
  in the Coffee class.
