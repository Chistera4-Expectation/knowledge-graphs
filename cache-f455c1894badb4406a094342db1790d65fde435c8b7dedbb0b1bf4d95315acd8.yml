  While cayenne pepper and Scotch bonnet pepper are both types of peppers, they have
  distinct characteristics and uses in cooking, making them separate entities rather
  than duplicates. Cayenne pepper is typically long and thin with a bright red color,
  while Scotch bonnet pepper has a more rounded shape and comes in various colors
  such as yellow, orange, and red. In terms of heat level, cayenne pepper ranks lower
  on the Scoville scale compared to Scotch bonnet pepper. Therefore, merging these
  two instances would not accurately represent their unique properties and differences.'
