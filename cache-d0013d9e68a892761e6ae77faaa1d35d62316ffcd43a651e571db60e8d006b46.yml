text: No, Oxygenated Water and Soft Water should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct properties
  and purposes. Oxygenated Water contains dissolved oxygen, which may have some health
  benefits, while Soft Water has a lower mineral content, making it more suitable
  for certain household tasks and preventing limescale buildup in appliances. Merging
  these two terms would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
