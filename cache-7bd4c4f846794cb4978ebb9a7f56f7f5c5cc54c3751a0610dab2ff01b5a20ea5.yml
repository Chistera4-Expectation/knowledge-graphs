text: No, the instances 'Pheasant Drumsticks' and 'Pheasant Patties' should not be
  merged together as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are
  derived from pheasant meat, they represent different cuts and preparations of the
  meat. Drumsticks are a specific part of the bird, while patties are a ground meat
  product shaped into flat, round forms. They have distinct culinary uses and nutritional
  profiles.
