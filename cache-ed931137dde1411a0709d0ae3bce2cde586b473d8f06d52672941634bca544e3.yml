text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of yogurt based
  on origin and flavor profile. "Australian Yogurt" refers to a yogurt originating
  from Australia, while "Savory Yogurt" refers to yogurt with a savory flavor profile.
  They are distinct concepts and should not be merged.
