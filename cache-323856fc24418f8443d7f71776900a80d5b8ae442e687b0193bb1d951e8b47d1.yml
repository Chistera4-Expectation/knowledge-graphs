text: No, Scotch Bonnet Pepper and White Pepper should not be merged as they are distinct
  types of peppers with different properties, flavors, and uses. Scotch Bonnet Pepper
  is a variety of chili pepper with a fruity, sweet flavor and intense heat, while
  White Pepper is made from the seeds of black peppercorns and has a milder, more
  earthy flavor. They have different applications in cooking and should be treated
  as separate entities.
