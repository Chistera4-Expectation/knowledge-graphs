text: ' No. Coconut oil and olive oil are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  despite both being edible vegetable oils. They have different nutritional profiles,
  origins, tastes, and uses, making them distinct from each other. Merging these two
  concepts would result in loss of important information and distinctions between
  the two types of oils.'
