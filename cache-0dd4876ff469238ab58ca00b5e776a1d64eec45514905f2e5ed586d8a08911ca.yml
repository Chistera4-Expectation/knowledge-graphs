text: No, Peanut Oil and Soybean Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they come from different
  sources (peanuts and soybeans, respectively) and have distinct properties, nutritional
  profiles, and uses in cooking and food preparation.
