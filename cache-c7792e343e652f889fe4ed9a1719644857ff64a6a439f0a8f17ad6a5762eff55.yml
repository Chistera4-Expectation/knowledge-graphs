text: No, they should not be merged together as they are two distinct food items made
  from different parts of the duck. Duck liver refers to the liver of the duck, while
  duck meatballs are made from ground duck meat and can include other ingredients
  such as herbs, spices, and binders. They may share some nutritional characteristics
  due to being derived from the same animal, but their preparation, composition, and
  nutrient profiles can differ significantly.
