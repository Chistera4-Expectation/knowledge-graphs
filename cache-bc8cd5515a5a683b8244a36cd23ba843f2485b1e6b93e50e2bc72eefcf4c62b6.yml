text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food. Boneless chicken refers to chicken meat without bones, while chicken gravy
  is a sauce made from chicken drippings or stock. They serve different purposes in
  a meal and have distinct nutritional profiles.
