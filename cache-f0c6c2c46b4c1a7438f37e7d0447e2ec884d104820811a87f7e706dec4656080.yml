text: ' No. While pork roast and pork spare ribs are both derived from pigs and can
  be categorized under "pork," they refer to distinct cuts of meat that differ in
  terms of their culinary uses, nutritional profiles, and cooking methods. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
