text: ' It is not accurate to label Tenebrionid Beetles as a type of "Honey." Tenebrionid
  Beetles are actually an order of insects, and honey is a sweet substance produced
  by bees. Therefore, there is no appropriate concise class name that can accurately
  describe Tenebrionid Beetles in relation to honey.'
