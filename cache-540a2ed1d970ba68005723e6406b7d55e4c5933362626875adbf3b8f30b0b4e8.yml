text: ' No. Mozzarella cheese and Pecorino Romano cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged together as they have distinct characteristics
  and uses despite both being types of cheese. Merging them would result in loss of
  important distinctions between these two cheeses.'
