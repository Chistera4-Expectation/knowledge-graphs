text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different food preparations
  and have distinct nutritional profiles. Ostrich broth is a liquid, while ostrich
  meatballs are a solid form of food. The preparation and nutritional content of these
  two dishes would differ significantly, even if they both use ostrich meat as the
  primary ingredient.
