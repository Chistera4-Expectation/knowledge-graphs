text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Cultured Butter and Organic
  Butter are types of butter, they have distinct characteristics. Cultured Butter
  is made from fermented cream, which gives it a tangy flavor, while Organic Butter
  is made from organic milk and follows specific organic farming practices. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate instances in the Butter class.
