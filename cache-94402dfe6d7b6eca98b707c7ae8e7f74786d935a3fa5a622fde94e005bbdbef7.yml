text: No, Rice Rolls and Sushi Rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates. Rice
  Rolls refer to a dish made of rice wrapped in nori (seaweed), often containing various
  fillings such as vegetables, fish, or meat. Sushi Rice, on the other hand, is a
  specific type of short-grain white rice that is prepared with vinegar, sugar, and
  salt and is used in various types of sushi, including Rice Rolls. While they are
  related in that they both involve rice, they are not the same thing and should not
  be merged as duplicates.
