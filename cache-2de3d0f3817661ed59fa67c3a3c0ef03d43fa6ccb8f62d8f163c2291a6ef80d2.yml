  While both ''Optional dipping sauce'' and ''Oyster sauce'' could potentially fall
  under the broader category of sauces, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  ''Optional dipping sauce'' implies that it is a type of sauce that may accompany
  a dish but is not required, whereas ''Oyster sauce'' refers to a specific type of
  sauce made from oysters. Therefore, these two concepts have distinct meanings and
  serve different purposes in describing food items.'
