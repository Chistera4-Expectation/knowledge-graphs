text: ' No. While Basmati is a type of rice, it has distinct characteristics such
  as aroma, taste, and length that set it apart from other types of rice. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  It''s important to maintain the distinction between different varieties of rice
  to provide accurate nutritional information and cooking recommendations for each
  one.'
