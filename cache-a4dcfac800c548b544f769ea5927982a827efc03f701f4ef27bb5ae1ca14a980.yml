  While both are types of butter, they have different characteristics and properties,
  such as their fat content and the source of the milk used in production. Grass-fed
  butter is typically made from the milk of cows that graze on grass, and it may have
  a higher nutritional value due to the increased levels of omega-3 fatty acids and
  conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Light butter, on the other hand, is lower in fat
  and calories compared to regular butter. Therefore, they should be treated as distinct
  entities in the classification of butter types.
