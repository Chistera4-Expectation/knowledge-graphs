text: "As a dietician, I would not give a simple yes or no answer to this question\
  \ as it requires an understanding of the specific context and definitions used for\
  \ 'Herbal Tea' and 'Infused Tea'. \n\nHowever, in general terms, 'Herbal Tea' typically\
  \ refers to a beverage made from the infusion of herbs, spices, or other plant material\
  \ in hot water, excluding the tea plant (Camellia sinensis). 'Infused Tea', on the\
  \ other hand, can refer to a broader category of teas, including herbal teas and\
  \ those made from the tea plant.\n\nIf 'Infused Tea' in this context specifically\
  \ refers to the broader category, then yes, 'Herbal Tea' and 'Infused Tea' could\
  \ be considered semantic and ontologic duplicates. However, if 'Infused Tea' is\
  \ being used to refer only to the tea plant-based teas, then they would not be considered\
  \ duplicates. It is essential to clarify the definitions used to accurately answer\
  \ the question."
