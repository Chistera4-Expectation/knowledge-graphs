text: No, "Duck Gravy" and "Duck Nuggets" should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both derived from poultry (ducks), they are different
  types of food with distinct characteristics and preparation methods. Duck gravy
  is a sauce made from the drippings of cooked duck, while duck nuggets are bite-sized
  pieces of duck meat that have been breaded and fried.
