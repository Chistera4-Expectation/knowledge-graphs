text: ' No. Salted fish and dry fish are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both belong to the edible fish class. They refer to different types
  of processed fish that undergo specific preservation methods (salting vs drying)
  which impact their taste, texture, nutritional content, and culinary uses. Therefore,
  they should remain separate instances.'
