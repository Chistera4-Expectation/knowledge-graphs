text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Kashmiri chili powder' and 'Red chili peppers' are spices and can be used to add
  heat to a dish, they have distinct characteristics. Kashmiri chili powder is known
  for its mild heat and vibrant red color, while red chili peppers can vary in heat
  level and are typically used in their whole or ground forms. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the differences between these two spices.
