text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of milk, they
  have different properties and uses. Goat's milk is a natural type of milk derived
  from goats, while lactose-free milk is a modified version of regular milk that has
  had lactose removed or reduced for people with lactose intolerance. Therefore, they
  should be considered separate instances in the Milk class.
