text: No, Brown Rice and Red Rice should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they both belong to the Rice class, they have different nutritional
  profiles, flavors, and appearances. Brown Rice and Red Rice are distinct varieties
  and should be treated as such in a dietary context.
