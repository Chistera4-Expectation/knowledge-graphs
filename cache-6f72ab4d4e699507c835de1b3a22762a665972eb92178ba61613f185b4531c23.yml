  While both "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Chicken Breast" are poultry-derived foods,
  they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer
  to distinct food items with different nutritional profiles and preparation methods.
  A chicken caesar salad includes various ingredients like lettuce, dressing, and
  possibly croutons, whereas chicken breast is simply a cut of meat from the bird''s
  chest area. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique identities
  within the realm of culinary classification.'
