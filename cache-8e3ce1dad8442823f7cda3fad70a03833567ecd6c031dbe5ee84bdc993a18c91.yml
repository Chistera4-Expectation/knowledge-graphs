text: No, the instances 'Ostrich Gizzards' and 'Ostrich' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are related to ostrich, they represent
  different parts of the animal. 'Ostrich Gizzards' refers to the muscular stomach
  of the ostrich, while 'Ostrich' refers to the entire bird. They should be treated
  as distinct entities within the Poultry-derived Food class.
