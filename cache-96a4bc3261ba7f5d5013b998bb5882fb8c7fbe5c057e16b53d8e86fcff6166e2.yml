text: No, Macadamia Nut Oil and Walnut Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both nut-based oils, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles, flavor profiles, and uses in cooking and food preparation.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
