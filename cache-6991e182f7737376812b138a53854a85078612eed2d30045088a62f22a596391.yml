text: As a dietician, I can provide an opinion on the nutrition aspect, but not on
  the technical implementation of the class structure. From a nutrition standpoint,
  French Bread and Grilled Bread can be considered different types of bread with distinct
  characteristics and preparation methods, and therefore, they may not be considered
  semantic or ontologic duplicates. However, the decision to merge them or not would
  depend on the specific requirements and design of the Bread class.
