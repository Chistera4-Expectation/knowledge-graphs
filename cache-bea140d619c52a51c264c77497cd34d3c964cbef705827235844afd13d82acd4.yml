  While both grapeseed oil and vegetable oil are types of edible oils, they cannot
  be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they have distinct differences
  in their composition, source, and nutritional profiles. Grapeseed oil is extracted
  from the seeds of grapes, while vegetable oil can refer to any oil obtained from
  plant sources such as soybeans, corn, cottonseed, or safflower. The specific type
  of vegetable oil will determine its unique characteristics. Therefore, it is important
  to maintain separate categories for these two types of oils.'
