text: No, "Duck Gizzards" and "Duck Nuggets" should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from ducks, they are different food
  items with distinct nutritional profiles and preparation methods. Duck Gizzards
  are a specific part of the duck anatomy and are typically cooked and served whole,
  while Duck Nuggets are processed duck meat formed into bite-sized pieces, often
  breaded and fried.
