text: No, 'Long-grain Rice' and 'Sticky Rice' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of rice with different characteristics
  and uses in cooking. Long-grain rice is known for its separate grains after cooking,
  while sticky rice, also known as glutinous rice, has a sticky and chewy texture
  when cooked. These differences are important to consider when discussing rice varieties
  and their culinary applications.
