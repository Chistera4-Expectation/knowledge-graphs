text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are milk alternatives,
  they have different nutritional compositions and come from different sources (lactose-free
  milk is derived from cow's milk, while macadamia milk is derived from macadamia
  nuts). Merging them would not accurately represent their distinct characteristics.
