text: No, the instances 'Australian Yogurt' and 'Low-Fat Yogurt' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. These two yogurt types are different
  based on their origin (Australian) and fat content (low-fat). They can both be part
  of the Yogurt class, but they represent distinct types of yogurt.
