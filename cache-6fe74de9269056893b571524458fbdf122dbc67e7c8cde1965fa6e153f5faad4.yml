text: No, they should not be merged. Although both French Yogurt and Kefir Yogurt
  are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics and ingredients. French
  Yogurt typically has a thicker texture and a sweeter taste, while Kefir Yogurt is
  a fermented milk drink with a thinner consistency and a tangy flavor due to the
  presence of kefir grains in its fermentation process. Merging them would result
  in a loss of information about these differences.
