text: ' No. Catfish fillets and fresh fish are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While catfish fillets can be considered a type of fresh fish (in terms of being
  an edible fish), they refer to different specific entities with distinct characteristics.
  Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions between these two concepts.'
