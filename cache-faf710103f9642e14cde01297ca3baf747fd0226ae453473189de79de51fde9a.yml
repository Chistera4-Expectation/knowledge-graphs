  While both Greek yogurt dressing and lemon herb dressing can be categories of salad
  dressings, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. Semantically, they
  have different ingredients and flavors - one is based on Greek yogurt while the
  other is based on lemon and herbs. Ontologically, they belong to different types
  of salad dressings with distinct characteristics. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as duplicates.'
