text: ' The most adequate class for "Hot Chocolate" would be: "Infusion Drink" or
  simply "Drink". Hot chocolate is made by adding hot water to cocoa powder, milk,
  and sugar. While it can contain small amounts of alcohol if prepared with liquor
  (making it an Alcoholic Drink in that case), its primary composition is a liquid
  infused with the flavors of cocoa and other ingredients.'
