  Although both "Flavorings" and "flavonoids" may sound similar, they refer to different
  concepts and do not represent semantic or ontological duplicates. Flavorings are
  substances added to food or drink to give them a particular taste, while flavonoids
  are a type of plant metabolite thought to provide health benefits. Therefore, it
  is appropriate for these two terms to remain separate within the tea class context.'
