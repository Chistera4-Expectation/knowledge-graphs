text: ' "Mulberry" would be the most concise and appropriate class name for silkworms,
  as mulberry leaves are their primary food source in nature. Silkworms feed exclusively
  on the leaves of mulberry trees, which contain the necessary nutrients for their
  growth and development. While honey is not entirely unsuitable for them, it does
  not provide a balanced diet for silkworms and should not be their sole food source.'
