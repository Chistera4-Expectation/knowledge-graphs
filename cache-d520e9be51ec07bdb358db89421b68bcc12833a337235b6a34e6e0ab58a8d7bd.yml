text: 'No, Turkey Broth and Turkey Stock should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are similar in terms of being poultry-derived,
  they have distinct differences in their preparation and usage.


  Turkey Broth is made by simmering turkey meat and bones with vegetables, herbs,
  and spices in water for a relatively short period of time. The resulting liquid
  is thinner and has a more pronounced flavor of the added ingredients. It is typically
  used in soups, sauces, and gravies.


  Turkey Stock, on the other hand, is made by simmering turkey bones, sometimes with
  a small amount of meat attached, in water for a longer period of time. The resulting
  liquid is thicker and has a more subtle flavor, primarily of the turkey. It is used
  as a base for soups, stews, and sauces, providing a richer and more concentrated
  flavor.


  Although both Turkey Broth and Turkey Stock are derived from turkey, their differences
  in preparation and usage warrant separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food
  class.'
