  While both "chicken tacos" and "low-sodium chicken broth" are poultry-derived foods,
  they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they represent
  distinct food items with unique ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional
  profiles. Merging them would not accurately reflect their differences and could
  lead to confusion when categorizing and analyzing various types of poultry-based
  dishes and products.'
