text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food. Duck Meatballs are made by forming ground duck meat into balls, while Duck
  Tenders are typically small, boneless pieces of duck meat. They have distinct preparation
  methods and culinary uses, so they should be considered separate instances.
