text: No, Argan Oil and Flaxseed Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Argan oil is primarily
  produced in Morocco and is rich in vitamin E and fatty acids, while flaxseed oil
  is derived from flax seeds and is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids.
