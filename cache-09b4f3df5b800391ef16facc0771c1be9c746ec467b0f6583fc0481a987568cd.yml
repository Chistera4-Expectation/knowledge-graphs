text: No, Red chili peppers and White pepper should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are different types of spices with distinct flavors and
  properties. Red chili peppers are typically spicy and come from the Capsicum genus,
  while White pepper is made from the seed of the pepper fruit and has a milder flavor.
  Although they are both used as spices, they have different culinary applications
  and nutritional profiles.
