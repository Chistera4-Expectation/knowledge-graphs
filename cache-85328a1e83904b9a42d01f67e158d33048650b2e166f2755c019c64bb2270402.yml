text: No, 'Boneless chicken' and 'Chicken Sausage' should not be merged together as
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from poultry,
  they differ in their composition and preparation methods. Boneless chicken refers
  to chicken meat without the bones, while chicken sausage is ground chicken meat
  mixed with various seasonings and stuffed into a casing.
