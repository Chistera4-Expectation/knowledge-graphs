text: No, 'Quail Meat' and 'Quail Stock' should not be merged together as they are
  distinct food items derived from quails. Quail Meat refers to the edible flesh of
  the bird, while Quail Stock refers to the liquid obtained from simmering quail bones,
  connective tissue, and aromatic vegetables, which is used as a base for soups, sauces,
  and other culinary preparations. They are different in composition, usage, and nutritional
  value, and should therefore be treated as separate instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
