text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both are derived from ostriches, they represent different food items. "Ostrich"
  refers to the meat itself, while "Ostrich Gravy" is a sauce made from the ostrich
  meat or its juices. They are distinct food items and should be treated as separate
  entities in a classification or ontology.
