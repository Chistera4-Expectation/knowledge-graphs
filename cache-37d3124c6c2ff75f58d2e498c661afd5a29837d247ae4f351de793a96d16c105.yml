  While both "chicken breast" and "rotisserie chicken" are types of poultry-derived
  food, they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they
  refer to different forms and preparations of chicken meat with distinct nutritional
  profiles. Chicken breast is typically skinless and raw, while rotisserie chicken
  has been seasoned, cooked on a spit, and may still have its skin intact. These differences
  result in varying nutrient levels, making them non-duplicate entities within the
  context of a food classification system.'
