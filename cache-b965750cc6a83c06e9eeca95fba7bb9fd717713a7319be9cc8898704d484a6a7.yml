  The two instances, "Boneless, skinless chicken breasts" and "Chicken pieces," are
  not identical in their entirety. Although they both contain chicken breast meat,
  they differ regarding cuts of meat and potential bone and skin content. Boneless,
  skinless chicken breasts consist of lean muscular tissue with all fat and connective
  tissues removed, whereas chicken pieces may include some fat, cartilage, and bones
  for flavor and texture. These variations make them distinct culinary items, so merging
  them would not accurately reflect their differences in nutritional value or usage
  in various recipes.'
