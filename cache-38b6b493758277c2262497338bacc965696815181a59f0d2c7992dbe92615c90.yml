text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both "Duck Gravy" and "Pheasant Gravy" are in the Poultry-derived Food class
  and are similar in that they are both derived from poultry, they are not duplicates.
  They are distinct dishes made from different types of poultry, and therefore should
  be treated as separate entities within the classification system.
