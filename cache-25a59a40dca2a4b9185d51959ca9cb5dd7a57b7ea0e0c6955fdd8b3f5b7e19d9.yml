text: 'No, the instances ''Goat cheese'' and ''Optional: additional cheese for topping''
  should not be merged together as they serve different purposes in the Cheese class.
  ''Goat cheese'' is a specific type of cheese, while ''Optional: additional cheese
  for topping'' refers to any cheese that can be added as a topping, which can include
  different types of cheese beyond just goat cheese.'
