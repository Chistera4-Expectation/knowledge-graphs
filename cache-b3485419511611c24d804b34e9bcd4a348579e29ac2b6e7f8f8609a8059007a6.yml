text: No, "Flavored Water" and "Sparkling Water" should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of water, they have distinct
  properties and characteristics. Flavored water typically contains added flavors,
  while sparkling water has carbonation. These differences in ingredients and properties
  make them unique and separate from each other.
