text: ' No. Buttermilk and other plant-based milks like oat milk are not semantic
  and ontological duplicates, despite having the common term "milk" in their names.
  They belong to different categories with distinct nutritional profiles: buttermilk
  is a dairy product while plant-based milks come from various sources (grains, nuts,
  seeds). Merging them would result in conceptual confusion.'
