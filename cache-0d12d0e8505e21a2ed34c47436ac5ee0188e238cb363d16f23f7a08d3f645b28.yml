  While both French dressing and Honey Mustard dressing are types of salad dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients and flavors. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. French dressing typically
  consists of oil, vinegar, and various seasonings such as mustard, paprika, and herbs,
  while Honey Mustard dressing is made with honey, mustard, mayonnaise, and sometimes
  other ingredients like vinegar or lemon juice for acidity. They cater to different
  taste preferences and cannot be considered identical.'
