text: No, 'Pheasant Nuggets' and 'Pheasant Patties' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both products are derived from poultry (pheasant),
  they have different forms and preparation methods, which could impact their nutritional
  composition and cooking guidelines. Therefore, they should be treated as distinct
  instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
