text: 'As a dietician, my expertise is in nutrition, not specifically in the classification
  of sauces. However, I can provide some guidance on the nutritional aspects of these
  sauces.


  While ''Chili sauce'' and ''Dark soy sauce'' share some common features, such as
  being sauces and containing sodium, they are different in taste and ingredients.
  Chili sauce is typically made with chili peppers, vinegar, and sugar, while dark
  soy sauce is made from fermented soybeans and roasted wheat, with added molasses
  for color.


  Given their distinct ingredients and tastes, I would recommend not merging them
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates, as they serve different purposes in cooking
  and have different nutritional profiles.'
