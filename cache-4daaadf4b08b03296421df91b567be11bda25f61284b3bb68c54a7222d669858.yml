text: As a dietician, I can provide a perspective based on the ingredients and nutritional
  properties of the teas. From a semantic and ontologic perspective, if both 'Cherry
  Vanilla Infusion' and 'Peach Thyme Infusion' contain the same ingredients and have
  the same nutritional properties, they could be considered semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. However, if they have different ingredients or nutritional properties,
  they should be treated as distinct instances. To make a definitive decision, I would
  need more information about the specific ingredients and nutritional properties
  of each tea.
