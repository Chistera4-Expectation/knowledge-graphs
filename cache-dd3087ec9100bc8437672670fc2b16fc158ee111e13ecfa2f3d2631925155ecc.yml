text: No, "Pheasant Patties" and "Pheasant Tenders" should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are derived from poultry (pheasant), they
  represent different food preparations and cooking methods. Pheasant Patties are
  typically made by grinding pheasant meat and forming it into patties, while Pheasant
  Tenders are usually strips of pheasant breast meat that are tenderized and cooked.
  These differences make them distinct food items within the Poultry-derived Food
  class.
