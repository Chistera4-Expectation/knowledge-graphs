  The two instances, "Cooked rice" and "Rice paper wrappers," are not duplicate entries.
  They refer to different things: cooked rice refers to the food product obtained
  by cooking rice grains, whereas rice paper wrappers are thin sheets made from rice
  flour used to wrap food, such as spring rolls or sushi. These are distinct concepts;
  therefore, they shouldn''t be combined.'
