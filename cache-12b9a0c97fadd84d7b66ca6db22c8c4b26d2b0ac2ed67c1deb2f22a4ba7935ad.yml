  While both "fried chicken" and "low-sodium chicken broth" are derived from poultry
  (chicken), they have different nutritional profiles and uses in meal preparation.
  Fried chicken is typically high in calories, fat, and sodium due to breading and
  frying methods, while low-sodium chicken broth has lower calorie and fat content
  but still provides protein and flavor for cooking purposes. Therefore, these two
  food items cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
