text: No, "Ostrich Broth" and "Ostrich Nuggets" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from ostriches, they are different
  types of food products with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary applications.
  "Ostrich Broth" refers to a liquid made by boiling ostrich meat, bones, and/or other
  ingredients, while "Ostrich Nuggets" are small pieces of ostrich meat that have
  been breaded and fried or baked.
