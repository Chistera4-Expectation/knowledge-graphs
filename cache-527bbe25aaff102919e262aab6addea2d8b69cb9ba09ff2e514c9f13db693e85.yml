text: ' No. While yellow onions are a type of onion, they have distinct characteristics
  that set them apart from other types of onions, such as white onions or red onions.
  Therefore, it is appropriate to keep "onions" and "yellow onions" as separate entities
  in an edible vegetable class, since not all onions are yellow onions. Merging these
  two terms would result in a loss of specificity and could lead to confusion when
  discussing different varieties of onions.'
