text: No, Quail Nuggets and Quail Tenders should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they both originate from quail meat, they have different shapes
  and textures. Nuggets typically have a uniform, bite-sized shape, while tenders
  are larger strips of meat. These differences in form and presentation can affect
  their culinary use and nutritional content, so they should be treated as distinct
  items within the Poultry-derived Food class.
