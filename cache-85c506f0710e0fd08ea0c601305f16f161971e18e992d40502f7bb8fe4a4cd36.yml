text: No, Bouillon powder and Onion powder should not be merged together as they are
  not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Bouillon powder is a seasoning made from
  dehydrated vegetables, meat, and/or seafood, while onion powder is a seasoning made
  solely from dehydrated onions. Although both are food seasonings, they have distinct
  compositions and uses.
