  While both "dipping sauce" and "fish sauce" can be types of sauces, they are not
  semantic nor ontological duplicates. They have different purposes, ingredients,
  and uses. Fish sauce is typically used as a condiment or ingredient in cooking to
  add umami flavor, while dipping sauce refers to any type of sauce that is meant
  to be used for dipping food into before eating it. Therefore, these two concepts
  should remain separate within the context of a sauce classification system.'
