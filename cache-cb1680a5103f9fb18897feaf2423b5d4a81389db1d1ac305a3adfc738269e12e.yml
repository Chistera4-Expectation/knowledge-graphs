text: No, Canola Oil and Palm Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different properties,
  nutritional profiles, and environmental impacts. Merging them together would not
  accurately represent the differences between these two types of oil.
