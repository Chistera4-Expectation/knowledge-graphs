text: No, 'Turkey Gizzards' and 'Turkey Nuggets' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are poultry-derived foods, they
  are different in terms of their composition, nutritional content, and preparation
  methods. Turkey gizzards are a part of a turkey's digestive tract, while turkey
  nuggets are typically made from ground turkey meat and may be breaded and fried.
  These differences in definition and properties warrant separate instances in the
  Poultry-derived Food class.
