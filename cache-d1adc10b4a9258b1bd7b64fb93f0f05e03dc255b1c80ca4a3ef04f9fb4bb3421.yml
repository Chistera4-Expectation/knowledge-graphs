text: ' No. Jamaican Jerk Seasoning and Taco Seasoning are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, as they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. While
  both are used to add flavor to dishes, they come from different culinary traditions
  (Caribbean vs Mexican) and their blends of spices differ significantly. Therefore,
  it is important to keep them separate in a Food Seasoning class.'
