text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct types of yogurt
  with different ingredients and properties. Icelandic Yogurt, also known as skyr,
  is typically made with cow's milk, while Non-Dairy Yogurt is made without any dairy
  ingredients, using alternatives such as soy, coconut, or almond milk. They cater
  to different dietary preferences and requirements.
