text: ' "Seasoning" would be the most adequate class for artificial flavors. This
  is because artificial flavors are often added to seasonings in order to enhance
  or modify their taste. While food dressings, sauces, spices, and sweeteners can
  also contain artificial flavors, they typically serve different functions (such
  as adding moisture, heat, or sweetness) beyond just providing flavor. Therefore,
  grouping artificial flavors under the broader category of "seasoning" allows for
  a more accurate representation of where these additives are most commonly found.'
