  While red pepper flakes and white pepper may both be types of spices and share some
  similarities, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different
  flavors, appearances, uses, and come from different parts of the plant. Red pepper
  flakes are made from dried and crushed red chili peppers and typically have a hotter
  flavor than white pepper. White pepper is made by removing the outer skin of ripe
  red peptides before drying and grinding them, resulting in a milder flavor with
  less heat. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as
  duplicates in this context.'
