text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of milk with different
  nutritional properties and origins. Milk refers to the liquid produced by mammals,
  while soy milk is a plant-based alternative made from soybeans. While they share
  the commonality of being a "milk" in a culinary context, they are different from
  a dietary and nutritional standpoint.
