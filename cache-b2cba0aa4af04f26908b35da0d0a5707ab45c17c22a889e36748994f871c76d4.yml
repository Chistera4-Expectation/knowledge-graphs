text: No, they should not be merged together. While they are both types of beef, they
  have distinct characteristics and uses in cooking. "Beef cubed steak" typically
  refers to a cut of beef that has been mechanically tenderized and is often used
  in dishes like stews, while "thinly sliced beef" refers to a cut of beef that has
  been sliced thinly and is often used for stir-fries or sandwiches. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the differences between these two types of beef.
