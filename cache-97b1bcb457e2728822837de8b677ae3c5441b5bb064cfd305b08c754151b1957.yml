text: ' "Beef" would be the most adequate class for beef, as it is specific and accurately
  describes that type of food. The other classes are too broad and could include many
  different types of foods. By using "Beef," there will be no confusion about what
  kind of meat is being referred to. Additionally, if you want to group similar items
  together in a more general category, then "Red Meat" can be used which includes
  Beef along with Lamb, Venison etc.'
