  While both Cherry Blossom Honey and Organic Clover Honey belong to the general category
  of honey (and thus may share some common properties), they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they have distinct characteristics that differentiate them from
  each other. For example, Cherry Blossom Honey is made from the nectar of cherry
  blossoms and has a unique flavor profile, while Organic Clover Honey comes from
  clover plants and also has its own specific taste and qualities. Therefore, it would
  be incorrect to merge these two types of honey as identical entities.'
