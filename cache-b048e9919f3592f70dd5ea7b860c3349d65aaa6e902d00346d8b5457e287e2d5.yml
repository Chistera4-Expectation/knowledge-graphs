text: No, Oolong Tea and Pu-erh Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both types of tea, they have distinct characteristics,
  flavors, and production methods that differentiate them. Merging them would not
  accurately represent the variety and nuances within the world of tea.
