text: ' No. The "category of cheese" and "serving size of the cheese" are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they represent different concepts related to cheese.
  A category of cheese refers to the type or kind of cheese (e.g., cheddar, mozzarella),
  while serving size refers to the amount of cheese being consumed (e.g., 1 oz). Merging
  these two concepts would result in confusion and make it difficult to accurately
  track nutrition information for each individual cheese product.'
