text: No, Turkey Gravy and Turkey Wings should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from turkey, they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional values and preparation methods. Turkey Gravy
  is a liquid sauce made from the drippings of cooked turkey, while Turkey Wings are
  the wings of a turkey, typically roasted or fried. These differences in preparation
  and nutritional content justify their separate classification in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
