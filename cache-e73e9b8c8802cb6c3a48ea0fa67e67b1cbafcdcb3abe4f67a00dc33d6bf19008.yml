text: ' ''Pasta Types'' would be the most adequate class for noodles. While noodles
  and pasta are similar in that they are both long, thin strands of dough, traditional
  noodles are typically made from wheat flour, water, and sometimes eggs, while pasta
  can also include ingredients such as durum semolina or rice flour. However, many
  people use the terms interchangeably to refer to any type of long, thin strand of
  dough. In this broader sense, noodles could fit into the category of ''Pasta Types.'''
