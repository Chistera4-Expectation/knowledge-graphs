  While coriander powder and turmeric powder are both ground spices commonly used
  in cooking, they have distinct flavors, aromas, and nutritional profiles. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates since
  they represent different ingredients with unique properties and uses. A dietitian
  would need to consider their individual effects on health, flavor contributions,
  and potential interactions with other foods when planning meals.'
