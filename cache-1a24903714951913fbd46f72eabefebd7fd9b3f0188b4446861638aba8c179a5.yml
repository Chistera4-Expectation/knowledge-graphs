text: No, they should not be merged. Corn husks and cornstarch are different parts
  of the corn plant with distinct uses and properties. Corn husks are the outer layer
  of the corn ear and are typically discarded or used as a wrapper for food, while
  cornstarch is a powdery starch extracted from the endosperm of the corn kernel and
  is used as a thickener in cooking and baking.
