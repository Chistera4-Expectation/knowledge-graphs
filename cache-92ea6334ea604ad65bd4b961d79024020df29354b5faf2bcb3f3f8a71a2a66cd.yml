text: No, Sesame Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they are
  derived from different plants and have distinct properties, flavors, and uses. Merging
  them would obscure these differences and lead to confusion.
