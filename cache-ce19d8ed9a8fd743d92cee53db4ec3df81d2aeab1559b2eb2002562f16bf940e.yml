text: No, Turkey Broth and Turkey Liver should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from turkey, they are different
  food items with distinct nutritional properties and uses in cooking. Turkey Broth
  is a liquid made by simmering turkey bones and/or meat, while Turkey Liver is a
  solid organ meat with its own nutritional profile.
