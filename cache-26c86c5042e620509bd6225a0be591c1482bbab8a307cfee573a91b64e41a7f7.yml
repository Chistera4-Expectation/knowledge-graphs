text: No, the instances 'Orange juice' and 'Prune juice' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of juice, they
  have distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and flavors. Merging them would
  lead to a loss of specific information and would not accurately represent the differences
  between the two types of juice.
