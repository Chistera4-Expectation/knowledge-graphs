text: No, Argan Oil and Palm Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different properties,
  uses, and origins. Argan Oil is derived from the kernels of the Argan tree, primarily
  found in Morocco, while Palm Oil comes from the fruit of the oil palm tree, which
  is grown in various tropical regions around the world. Merging these two distinct
  oils would lead to a loss of important information and could cause confusion.
