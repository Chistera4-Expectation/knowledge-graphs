text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Guinea Fowl Stock" and "Guinea
  Fowl Wings" are poultry-derived foods, they are different products with distinct
  uses in cooking and dietary considerations. Guinea Fowl Stock is a liquid made by
  simmering Guinea Fowl bones, whereas Guinea Fowl Wings are a specific cut of the
  bird's meat. They have different nutritional profiles and are used in different
  ways in the kitchen. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
