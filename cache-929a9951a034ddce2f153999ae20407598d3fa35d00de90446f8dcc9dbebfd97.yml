text: No, Focaccia Bread and Naan Bread should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are types of bread, they have distinct
  characteristics, ingredients, and cultural origins. Focaccia is an Italian flatbread
  typically made with olive oil, while Naan is a flatbread from the Indian subcontinent
  made with yeast and cooked in a tandoor oven. These differences warrant separate
  instances in the Bread class.
