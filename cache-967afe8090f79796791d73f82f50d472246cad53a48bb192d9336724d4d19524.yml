text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from ostrich meat, they are different products with distinct characteristics
  and preparation methods. Ostrich nuggets and ostrich wings serve different culinary
  purposes and can be considered as separate entities in the Poultry-derived Food
  class.
