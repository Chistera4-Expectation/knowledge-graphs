text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both "Chicken Sausage" and "Quail Sausage" are sausages derived from poultry,
  they are made from different types of poultry, which can lead to differences in
  taste, texture, and nutritional content. Thus, they should be treated as separate
  instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
