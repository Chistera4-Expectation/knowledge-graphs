  While flaxseeds and sunflower seeds are both types of edible seeds that share some
  similarities, they have important differences from a nutritional standpoint and
  therefore should not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates. Flaxseeds,
  for example, contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, lignans, and fiber, making
  them valuable for heart health, digestion, and hormone balance. On the other hand,
  sunflower seeds are rich in vitamin E, magnesium, and selenium, which support immune
  function, bone health, and antioxidant activity. Merging these two distinct foods
  into one category would overlook their unique benefits and applications in healthy
  diets.'
