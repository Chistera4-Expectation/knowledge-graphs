text: ' No. While apple seeds and cantaloupe seeds are both types of seed, they come
  from different plants (apples and cantaloupes, respectively) and have different
  nutritional profiles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates in the context of an edible seeds class. It is important
  to maintain clear distinctions between different food items based on their unique
  characteristics and properties.'
