text: ' No. Although apple cider vinegar and red wine vinegar may have some similar
  uses and nutritional properties, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they come from different sources (apple cider vs. red wine) and therefore
  have unique compositions and characteristics. Merging them would result in loss
  of important distinctions between the two types of sauce.'
