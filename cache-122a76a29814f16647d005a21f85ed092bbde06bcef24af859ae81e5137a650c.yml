text: ' No. Jasmine rice and rice flour are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. They are two different forms of rice with
  distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Jasmine rice is a type of long-grain
  rice that is typically used as a whole grain, while rice flour is made from grinding
  rice into a fine powder and is often used as a gluten-free alternative to wheat
  flour.'
