text: No, Flaxseed Milk and Milk should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Flaxseed Milk is a specific type of milk derived from flaxseeds, while
  "Milk" is a broader term encompassing various types of milk from different sources,
  such as cow, goat, or soy. They have distinct properties and nutritional compositions,
  so they should be considered as separate instances in the Milk class.
