text: As a dietician, I would advise that 'Brown sugar' and 'Sugar' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they share similarities,
  they also have differences in nutritional content and properties. Brown sugar is
  often considered to be slightly healthier due to its molasses content, which provides
  some minerals and vitamins. However, both brown sugar and white sugar are still
  considered added sugars and should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced
  diet. Therefore, keeping them separate in a Sweetener class is beneficial for accurate
  categorization and understanding of their distinct characteristics.
