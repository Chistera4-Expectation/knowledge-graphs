  The instances "Carrots" and "Carrots, peeled" are not exact duplicates, as they
  have different states of preparation. While both refer to the same vegetable, "Carrots,
  peeled" specifically refers to carrots that have been peeled, which is a distinct
  form of preparation from whole carrots. This difference in state could impact their
  nutritional value, flavor, texture, and usage in various recipes. Therefore, it''s
  appropriate to keep them separate rather than merging them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
