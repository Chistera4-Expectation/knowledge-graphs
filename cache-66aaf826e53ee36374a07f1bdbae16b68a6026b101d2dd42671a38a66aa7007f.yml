text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of sauces with distinct
  ingredients and flavors. Dark soy sauce is a fermented soy product with a rich,
  slightly sweet flavor, while pesto sauce is a blend of basil, garlic, olive oil,
  and Parmesan cheese with a fresh, herbaceous taste.
