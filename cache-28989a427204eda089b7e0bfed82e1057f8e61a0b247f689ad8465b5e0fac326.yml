text: No, Coconut Oil and Sesame Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although both are edible vegetal oils, they have distinct characteristics,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Coconut oil is known for its saturated fat content
  and is often used in cooking and as a moisturizer, while sesame oil has a unique
  nutty aroma and is commonly used in Asian cuisine for its flavor.
