text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are poultry-derived foods, they have different nutritional profiles, taste, and
  preparation methods. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are leaner and lower in
  fat compared to duck breast, which is richer and fattier. Therefore, they should
  be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
