text: ' No. Jasmine rice and long grain white rice are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they may have some similarities. They differ in taste, texture,
  nutritional content, and origin, among other factors. Therefore, it is essential
  to maintain them as separate entities for accurate classification and understanding
  of their unique properties.'
