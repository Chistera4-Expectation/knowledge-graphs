  Caraway seeds and chia seeds are different types of seeds with distinct nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses, so they should not be merged as duplicates. Caraway
  seeds have a stronger flavor and are commonly used in breads, while chia seeds are
  known for their texture and are often used as a topping or added to liquid-based
  dishes for extra fiber and nutrients.'
