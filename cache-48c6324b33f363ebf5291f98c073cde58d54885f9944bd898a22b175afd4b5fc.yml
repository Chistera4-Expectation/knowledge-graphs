text: As a dietician, my answer is based on the nutritional and culinary aspects of
  pasta. From a semantic and ontological perspective, 'Dumplings' and 'Filling' are
  not directly related to pasta types. Dumplings can be made with various doughs,
  including pasta dough, but they are not a pasta type themselves. Similarly, fillings
  can be used in certain types of pasta, like ravioli or tortellini, but they do not
  define a specific pasta type. Therefore, I would say no, 'Dumplings' and 'Filling'
  should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates in the Pasta Types class.
