  While both French dressing and tahini dressing are types of salad dressings, they
  have distinct ingredients, flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles, making them
  unique food items that shouldn''t be merged as semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Here is why:


  1. Semantically, although both can be classified under "salad dressing," their specific
  meanings differ due to their individual characteristics. For example, French dressing
  typically has a vinaigrette-based formula with oil, vinegar, spices, and sometimes
  ketchup for color, whereas tahini dressing is made from sesame paste, lemon juice,
  garlic, water, and salt, resulting in different tastes and appearances.

  2. Ontologically, merging these two concepts would not accurately represent reality
  since there exist real differences between French dressing and tahini dressing in
  terms of their physical properties, uses, and cultural backgrounds.

  3. Merging them could lead to confusion regarding recipe recommendations, ingredient
  sourcing, preparation methods, storage requirements, and health benefits associated
  with each type of dressing. By maintaining separate categories for French dressing
  and Tahini dressing, it allows users to better understand the nuances related to
  these products and make informed decisions when selecting or preparing them.'
