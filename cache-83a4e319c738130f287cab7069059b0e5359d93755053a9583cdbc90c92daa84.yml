text: No, Porcelain Crab and Rock Crab should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both are crustaceans, they belong to different families
  and have distinct characteristics. Porcelain Crabs belong to the family Porcellanidae,
  while Rock Crabs belong to the family Cancridae. They have different appearances,
  habitats, and behaviors, which would be lost if they were merged.
