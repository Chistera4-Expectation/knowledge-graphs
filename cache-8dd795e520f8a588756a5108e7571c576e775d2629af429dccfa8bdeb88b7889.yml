text: ' No. Blackberry honey and Tupelo honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they both belong to the category of "honey." They come from different
  floral sources (blackberries vs tupelo trees) which gives them distinct flavors,
  colors, and properties. Therefore, it is important to keep these two types of honey
  separate when considering their nutritional profiles and other characteristics.'
