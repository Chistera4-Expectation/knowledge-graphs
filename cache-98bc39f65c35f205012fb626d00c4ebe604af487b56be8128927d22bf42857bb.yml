text: ' Pork-derived Food (specifically, "Pork Sausages") would be the most appropriate
  classification for sausages from this list. This is because sausages are typically
  made primarily from pork meat and other pork derivatives such as fat or casings.
  However, there can also be variations with beef, chicken, or other meats, so using
  a more specific term like "Pork Sausages" would help clarify the type being referred
  to.'
