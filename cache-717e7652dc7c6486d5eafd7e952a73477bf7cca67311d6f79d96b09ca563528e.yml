text: No, coconut water and rainwater should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates in the Drinking Water class. Although both are liquids, they
  have different compositions and properties. Coconut water is a natural beverage
  found in young, green coconuts and contains electrolytes, while rainwater is water
  that falls as precipitation from the atmosphere. They serve different purposes and
  are distinct from each other in their characteristics.
