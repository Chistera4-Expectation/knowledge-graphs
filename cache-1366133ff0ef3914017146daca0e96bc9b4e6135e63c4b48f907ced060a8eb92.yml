text: ' Among the given options, "Pasta Types" and "Rice" are the most appropriate
  classes for whole grains. Whole grains can be found in various forms including pasta
  and rice, as long as they are labeled as "whole grain." Other options like bread,
  breakfast cereal, edible fruits, mushrooms, seeds, vegetable, oil, and seaweed do
  contain some nutrients from grains but may not provide the same fiber-rich, intact
  grain benefits as whole grains in their pure form (pasta or rice).'
