  While brown and white rice are both types of rice and share some similarities, they
  have important differences that make them distinct from each other. Brown rice is
  considered a whole grain because it still contains the bran and germ layers, which
  provide fiber, B vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. In contrast, white rice has
  had these layers removed during processing, resulting in a product with a longer
  shelf life but fewer nutrients. Due to their unique nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses, it would not be appropriate to merge ''brown rice'' and ''white rice'' as
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
