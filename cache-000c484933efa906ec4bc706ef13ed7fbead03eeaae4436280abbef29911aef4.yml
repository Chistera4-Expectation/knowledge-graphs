text: No, Argan Oil and Macadamia Nut Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they share some similarities as edible vegetal
  oils, they have distinct properties, nutritional profiles, and uses. Merging them
  together would not accurately represent the differences between these two oils.
