text: ' Among the given options, the most appropriate class for "Emulsifiers" would
  be "Food Additives" or specifically, "Emulsion Stabilizers". Emulsifiers are not
  exactly a type of dressing, seasoning, sauce, spice, or sweetener. Instead, they
  function as additives that help to stabilize and maintain the uniform mixture of
  two immiscible liquids (such as oil in water) in various food products including
  dressings, sauces, and processed foods.'
