  The two instances, "Greek yogurt ranch" and "Ranch," are not identical in their
  composition and purpose, even though they share some similarities in taste and usage.
  "Greek yogurt ranch" is a type of salad dressing that combines Greek yogurt with
  ranch seasoning, whereas "Ranch" refers to a specific brand and flavor of salad
  dressing that does not contain Greek yogurt. Therefore, they cannot be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
