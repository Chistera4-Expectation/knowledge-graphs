text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Additional
  seasonings and toppings are related, but they serve different purposes and have
  distinct characteristics. Additional seasonings are usually added during cooking
  or before serving to enhance the flavor of the dish, while toppings are typically
  added after cooking and serve as a decorative or textural element. They both contribute
  to the overall taste and presentation of a dish, but they should be kept as separate
  instances in the Food Seasoning class.
