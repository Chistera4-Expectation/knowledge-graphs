text: ' The most adequate class for "Meatballs" would be "Poultry-derived Food" or
  "Pork-derived Food", depending on the type of meat used in the meatballs. If it
  is made from beef, then "Beef" could also be an option. However, since meatballs
  are typically associated with meat derived from poultry and pork, those two classes
  would be the most appropriate choices.'
