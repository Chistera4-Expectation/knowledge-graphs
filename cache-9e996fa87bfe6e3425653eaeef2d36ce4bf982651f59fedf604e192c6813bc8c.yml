text: No, the instances 'Chanterelle Mushroom' and 'Enoki Mushroom' should not be
  merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with unique characteristics, nutritional values, and culinary
  uses. Merging them would result in a loss of important information and potentially
  lead to confusion in the context of dietary advice or meal planning.
