  While both "Comb Honey" and "Fireweed Honey" are types of honey, they are not semantic
  nor ontological duplicates. They refer to different forms and sources of honey:


  1. Comb Honey is pure, raw honey that still contains the original wax comb built
  by honeybees. It offers an unprocessed and unpasteurized form of honey with all
  its beneficial enzymes intact.

  2. Fireweed Honey is a type of monofloral honey produced primarily from the nectar
  of fireweed plants (Chamerion angustifolium). This variety has a distinctively light
  color, mild flavor, and higher fructose-to-glucose ratio compared to other honeys.


  Merging these terms would lead to loss of important information about their unique
  characteristics and uses.'
