text: ' The most adequate class for "paste" would be "Food Dressing". This is because
  paste can often refer to a thick, smooth mixture that is used as a condiment or
  spread, which aligns with the definition of food dressing. Other potential classes
  such as Sauce and Spice may also include pastes but are typically more focused on
  liquid sauces and ground spices respectively.'
