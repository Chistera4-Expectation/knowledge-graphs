text: ' The most adequate class for Seltzer water among the given options would be
  "Carbonated Water" or "Non-Alcoholic Beverage". However, since none of those classes
  were explicitly provided in your list, I cannot give you an exact answer based on
  that. But if we are to compare it with the given options, neither Alcoholic Drink
  nor Edible Vegetable Oil is an appropriate classification for seltzer water. Coffee,
  Honey, Juice, Milk, Tea, and Energy Drink are all food items or types of beverages,
  while Seltzer water falls under the category of non-alcoholic carbonated drinks.'
