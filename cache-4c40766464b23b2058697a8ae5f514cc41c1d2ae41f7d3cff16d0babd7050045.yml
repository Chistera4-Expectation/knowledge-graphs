  Chanterelle mushrooms and Portobello mushrooms are two different species of mushrooms
  with distinct characteristics, flavors, and textures. While they share some similarities,
  they have differences in their nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and growing
  habits. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
