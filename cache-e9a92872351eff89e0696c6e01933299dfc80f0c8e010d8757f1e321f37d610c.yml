text: No, the instances 'Challah Bread' and 'Ciabatta Bread' should not be merged
  together as they are distinct types of bread with different ingredients, textures,
  and cultural origins. Although they both fall under the broader category of bread,
  they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
