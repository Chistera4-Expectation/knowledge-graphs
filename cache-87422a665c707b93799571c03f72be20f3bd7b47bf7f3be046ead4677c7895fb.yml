text: No, "Guinea Fowl Thighs" and "Guinea Fowl Wings" should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from the same animal, they
  represent different cuts of meat with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses. Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and information.
