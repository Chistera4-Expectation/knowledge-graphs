text: No, they should not be merged together as they have distinct characteristics
  and uses in cooking. While they both contain soy, Soy Sauce is typically saltier
  and more concentrated, while Teriyaki Sauce is a sweeter marinade with additional
  ingredients like sugar, garlic, and ginger. Merging them would not accurately represent
  the differences in their flavors and applications in recipes.
