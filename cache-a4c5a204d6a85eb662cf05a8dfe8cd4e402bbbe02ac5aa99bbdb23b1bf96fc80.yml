text: ' No. Cottonseed oil and pumpkin seed oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While both are types of edible vegetable oils,
  they come from different plants (cotton and pumpkins, respectively) and have distinct
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to maintain
  them as separate instances.'
