text: ' No. Rye bread and bread for serving are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They refer to different types of bread with distinct
  characteristics and uses. Rye bread is made using rye grain flour, while bread for
  serving refers to any type of bread that is served alongside a meal, which can include
  rye bread but also other varieties such as white bread or whole wheat bread. Therefore,
  they represent separate concepts within the domain of bread and should remain as
  distinct instances.'
