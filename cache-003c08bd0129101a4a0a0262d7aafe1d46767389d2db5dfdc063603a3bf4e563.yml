text: No, Cremini mushrooms and Portobello mushrooms should not be merged together
  as they are different stages of development of the same species, Agaricus bisporus.
  Cremini mushrooms are younger and have a lighter color, while Portobello mushrooms
  are fully mature and have a darker color. Although they are similar, they have different
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses.
