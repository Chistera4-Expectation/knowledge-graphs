text: No, they should not be merged together. Distilled water and sparkling water
  are different types of water with distinct properties. Distilled water is purified
  water that has had impurities removed through a distillation process, while sparkling
  water is carbonated water that contains dissolved carbon dioxide gas, giving it
  a fizzy texture. Although both are types of drinking water, they have different
  characteristics and uses.
