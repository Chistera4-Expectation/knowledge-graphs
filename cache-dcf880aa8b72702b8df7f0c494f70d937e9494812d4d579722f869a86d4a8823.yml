  While sesame paste (tahini) is made from sesame seeds, they are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates because they refer to distinct food products with different
  physical properties and uses in cooking. Sesame seeds can be consumed whole or ground
  into various forms such as powder or paste, while sesame paste has a smooth texture
  that is commonly used as an ingredient in its own right.'
