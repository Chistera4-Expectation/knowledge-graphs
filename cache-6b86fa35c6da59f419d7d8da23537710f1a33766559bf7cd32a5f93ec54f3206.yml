text: No, Pistachio Oil and Soybean Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they are derived
  from different plants (pistachio nuts and soybeans, respectively) and have distinct
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking and cuisine.
