text: No, they should not be merged together. While both instances are derived from
  ducks, they are different types of food products with distinct nutritional profiles
  and culinary uses. Duck patties are typically made from ground duck meat and are
  a protein-rich food, while duck stock is a liquid made from simmering duck bones,
  meat, and vegetables, and serves as a flavorful base for soups and sauces. Merging
  them would not accurately reflect their differences in the Poultry-derived Food
  class.
