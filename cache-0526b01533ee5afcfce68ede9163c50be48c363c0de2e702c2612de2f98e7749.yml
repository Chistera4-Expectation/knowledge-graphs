text: No, the instances 'Chicken of the Woods Mushroom' and 'King Oyster Mushroom'
  should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they
  are both types of edible mushrooms, they have distinct characteristics, appearances,
  and culinary uses. Therefore, they should be treated as separate entities in a classification
  system.
