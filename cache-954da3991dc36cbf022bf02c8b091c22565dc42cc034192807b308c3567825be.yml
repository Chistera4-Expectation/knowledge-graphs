text: As a dietician, my answer would be no, they should not be merged together. Chamomile
  tea is a specific type of herbal tea, but there are many other types of herbal teas
  that are not chamomile. Merging them would imply that they are the same thing, which
  is not accurate. While they may share some similarities, they are distinct types
  of tea.
