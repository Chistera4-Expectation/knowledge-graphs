text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of drinking
  water, they have distinct properties and characteristics. Hard water contains high
  levels of minerals such as calcium and magnesium, while sparkling water is carbonated
  and may or may not contain minerals. These differences make them separate entities
  within the classification of drinking water.
