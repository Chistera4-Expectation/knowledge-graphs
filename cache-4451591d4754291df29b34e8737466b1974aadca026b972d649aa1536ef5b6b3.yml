text: No, Corn Flakes and Frosted Flakes should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are breakfast cereals, they have distinct differences
  in taste, texture, and nutritional content. Corn Flakes are made from corn, while
  Frosted Flakes have a frosted sugar coating. These differences are significant enough
  to warrant separate instances in a Breakfast Cereal class.
