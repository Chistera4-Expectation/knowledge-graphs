  The term "lobster meat" refers specifically to the edible flesh of the lobster,
  while "lobsters" refers to the crustacean itself, including its shell, legs, and
  other parts that are not typically consumed. While they share some similarities
  in terms of their nutritional profile, they have different culinary uses and preparation
  methods, making them distinct entities for the purposes of a recipe database like
  Edible Crustaceans.'
