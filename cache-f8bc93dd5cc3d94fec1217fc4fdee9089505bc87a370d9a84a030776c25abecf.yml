  While Caesar dressing and Italian dressing may have some similarities, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct ingredients, flavors,
  and textures that set them apart from each other. Merging these two concepts would
  disregard their unique characteristics and could lead to confusion for individuals
  who follow specific diets or have allergies to certain ingredients commonly found
  in one type of dressing but not the other.'
