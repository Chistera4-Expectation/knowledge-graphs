  While both "fresh mozzarella cheese" and "queso fresco" are types of fresh cheeses,
  they have different origins, textures, and flavors. Fresh mozzarella is an Italian
  cheese made from cow''s milk, has a soft, spongy texture, and a milky, slightly
  sweet flavor. Queso fresco, on the other hand, is a Mexican cheese made from cow''s
  milk or a combination of cow''s and goat''s milk, has a crumbly texture, and a tangy,
  slightly salty flavor. They can be used in similar dishes, but they are distinct
  cheeses with their own unique characteristics, and therefore, should not be merged
  as duplicates.'
