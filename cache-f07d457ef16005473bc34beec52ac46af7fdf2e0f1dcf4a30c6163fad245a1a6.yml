text: No, they should not be merged. Coconut water and purified water are different
  types of drinking water with distinct compositions, nutritional profiles, and characteristics.
  Coconut water is a natural beverage derived from young coconuts, while purified
  water is typically treated tap water that has been filtered to remove impurities.
  They serve different purposes and cater to different needs.
