text: ' No, Cornbread and French bread should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both types of bread, they have distinct ingredients,
  preparation methods, cultural origins, and nutritional profiles, making them unique
  entities within the bread category. Merging them would result in loss of specific
  information about each type of bread.'
