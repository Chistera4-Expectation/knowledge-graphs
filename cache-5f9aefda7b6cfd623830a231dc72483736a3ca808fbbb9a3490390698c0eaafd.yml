text: ' No. Calcium content per serving and fiber per serving are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates because they measure different nutritional components found
  in cheese. Calcium is a mineral that plays an important role in building bones and
  teeth, while fiber is a type of carbohydrate that helps maintain a healthy digestive
  system by promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. Therefore,
  it is useful to keep these two properties separate when describing the nutritional
  value of different types of cheese.'
