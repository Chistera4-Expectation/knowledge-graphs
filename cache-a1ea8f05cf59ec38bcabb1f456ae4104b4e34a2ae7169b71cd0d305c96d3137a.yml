  While both chicken nuggets and chicken soup are made from poultry, they have different
  nutritional profiles and cooking methods, making them distinct food items. Chicken
  nuggets are typically deep-fried and high in fat and calories, while chicken soup
  can range from low to moderate in these values depending on its preparation method.
  Additionally, chicken soup often contains vegetables, grains, and seasonings that
  contribute additional vitamins and minerals not found in chicken nuggets. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep these two instances separate within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.'
