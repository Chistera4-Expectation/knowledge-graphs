  While horseradish dressing and wasabi dressing may have some similarities (both
  are typically spicy and used to add flavor to dishes), they are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates. They use different ingredients - one uses prepared horseradish
  while the other uses wasabi root or paste - which can result in distinct flavors,
  textures, and levels of heat. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two instances together.'
