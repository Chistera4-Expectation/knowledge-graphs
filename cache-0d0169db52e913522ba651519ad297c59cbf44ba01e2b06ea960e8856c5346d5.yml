  Although both are types of coffee, 'Drip Coffee' and 'strong coffee' have distinct
  characteristics and preparation methods. Drip coffee refers to a specific brewing
  method using a drip coffee maker, while 'strong coffee' is a subjective term that
  can be applied to various coffee preparations with higher concentrations of coffee
  or stronger flavors.
