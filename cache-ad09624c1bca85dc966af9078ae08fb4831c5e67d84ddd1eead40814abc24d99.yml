  While both amaranth seeds and chia seeds are edible and can provide crunch to dishes,
  they have different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Amaranth seeds are higher
  in protein and minerals like iron and phosphorus compared to chia seeds, which are
  higher in fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. Additionally, amaranth seeds have a slightly
  sweet and nutty flavor while chia seeds have a more neutral taste. Therefore, it
  is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
