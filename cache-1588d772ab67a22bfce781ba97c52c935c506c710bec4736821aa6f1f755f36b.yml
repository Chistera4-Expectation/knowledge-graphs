text: No, Brown Rice and Sticky Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both types of rice, they have distinct characteristics
  and uses. Brown Rice is a whole grain rice that retains the bran layer, providing
  more fiber and nutrients than white rice. Sticky Rice, also known as glutinous rice,
  has a higher starch content that gives it a sticky texture when cooked, making it
  suitable for specific dishes like sushi and desserts.
