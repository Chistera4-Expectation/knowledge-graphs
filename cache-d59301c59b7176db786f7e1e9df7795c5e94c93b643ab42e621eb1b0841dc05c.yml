text: ' No. Catfish and fresh raw fish are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While catfish is a type of edible fish, not all
  fresh raw fish are catfish. They refer to different specific types of edible fish
  and have distinct characteristics and properties.'
