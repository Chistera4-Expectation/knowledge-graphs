text: ' The most adequate class for "Life" among the given options would be ''Breakfast
  Cereal.'' This is because breakfast cereals are often fortified with essential nutrients
  and vitamins that contribute to a balanced and healthy lifestyle. However, it is
  important to choose whole grain or high-fiber cereals over those that are heavily
  processed or high in sugar content.'
