  While canola oil and peanut oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, sources, and uses.
  Canola oil is derived from rapeseed plants, while peanut oil comes from peanuts.
  They also differ in their fatty acid composition and smoke points, making them more
  suitable for different cooking methods. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
