  While coconut oil and soybean oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct nutritional profiles and properties that make them unique. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Each
  type of oil has its own specific uses and health benefits, which makes it important
  to maintain separate categories for them.'
