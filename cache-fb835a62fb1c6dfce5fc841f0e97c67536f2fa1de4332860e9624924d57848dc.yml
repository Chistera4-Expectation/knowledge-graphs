text: No, the instances 'Fish fillet' and 'Swordfish' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Fish fillet refers to a general term for any
  boneless, skinless cut of fish, whereas Swordfish is a specific type of fish. These
  two instances have distinct properties and characteristics, and should remain separate
  in a classification system.
