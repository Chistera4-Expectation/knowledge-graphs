text: No, 'Ostrich Soup' and 'Quail Soup' should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of soups made from different types of poultry. While they share the
  common characteristic of being poultry-derived soups, they have unique ingredients,
  nutritional profiles, and cultural associations. Maintaining separate instances
  allows for accurate categorization and representation of these distinct food items.
