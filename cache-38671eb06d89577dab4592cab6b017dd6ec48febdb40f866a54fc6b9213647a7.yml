text: No, Jasmine Rice and Steamed white rice should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of rice, they have distinct characteristics
  and properties. Jasmine Rice is a long-grain rice variety with a distinct aroma,
  while Steamed white rice is a more generic term for cooked white rice that has been
  steamed.
