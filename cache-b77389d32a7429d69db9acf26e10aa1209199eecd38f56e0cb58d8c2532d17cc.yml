text: ' No. Cottonseed oil and rice bran oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they are both types of edible vegetable oils, they come from different plant
  sources (cottonseeds vs. rice brans) and have distinct nutritional profiles, production
  processes, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate
  instances in a classification system for edible vegetable oils.'
