text: No, the instances 'Guinea Fowl Broth' and 'Guinea Fowl Tenders' should not be
  merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from the
  same animal, they represent different types of poultry-derived foods with distinct
  nutritional profiles and preparation methods. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the variety of poultry-derived food options.
