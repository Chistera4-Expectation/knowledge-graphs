  Chicken broth and chicken parmesan are not semantic or ontological duplicates, despite
  both being poultry-derived foods that include chicken as an ingredient. They serve
  different culinary purposes and have distinct nutritional profiles:


  1. Chicken Broth: A liquid made by simmering chicken bones, meat, vegetables, herbs,
  and spices. It is often used as a base for soups, sauces, and other dishes. As a
  clear, low-calorie, and mostly protein-based food, it provides hydration while offering
  some essential vitamins and minerals.

  2. Chicken Parmesan (or Chicken Parmigiana): A breaded and fried chicken cutlet
  topped with tomato sauce, melted cheese, and typically served over pasta. This dish
  offers more energy density due to its higher fat content from breading and cheese,
  along with carbohydrates from any included pasta. The overall nutritional profile
  differs significantly compared to chicken broth.


  Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic or ontological duplicates since
  their meanings and roles in gastronomy differ.'
