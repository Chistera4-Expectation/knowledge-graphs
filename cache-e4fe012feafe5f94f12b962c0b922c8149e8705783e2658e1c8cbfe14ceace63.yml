  While both "condensed milk" and "pasteurization method" are related to milk, they
  refer to different aspects of it. Condensed milk is a specific type of milk product
  that has been concentrated and sweetened, while pasteurization method refers to
  the process used to kill bacteria in milk through heat treatment. Therefore, merging
  them would not accurately represent their distinct concepts in the context of milk.'
