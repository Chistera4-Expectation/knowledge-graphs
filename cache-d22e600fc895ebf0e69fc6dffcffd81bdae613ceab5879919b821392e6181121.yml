  While chili paste and miso paste are both types of food pastes used for seasoning,
  they have different ingredients, flavors, uses, and cultural origins. Chili paste
  is typically made from ground chilies, vinegar, oil, and spices, while miso paste
  is made from fermented soybeans and sometimes rice or barley. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
