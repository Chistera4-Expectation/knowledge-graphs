text: No, Bang Energy and C4 Energy should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they may share some similarities as energy drink products,
  they are distinct brands and have different ingredients, flavors, and nutritional
  profiles. As a dietician, you would want to consider each product individually when
  evaluating their impact on an individual's diet and overall health.
