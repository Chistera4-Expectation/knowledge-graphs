  While both kiwi seeds and quinoa seeds come from edible plants, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they differ in their nutritional content, culinary
  uses, and botanical classification. Kiwi seeds belong to the Actinidia chinensis
  plant species and have a minimal contribution to nutrition due to their tiny size.
  On the other hand, quinoa seeds (Chenopodium quinoa) are considered a whole grain
  with high nutritional value, including protein, fiber, and essential amino acids.
  Therefore, it is important to maintain these distinct categories for accurate information
  presentation in an "Edible Seeds" class context.'
