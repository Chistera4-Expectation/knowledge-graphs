text: No, Almond Milk and Cashew Milk should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both plant-based milk alternatives, they
  have distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and production processes. They
  should be treated as separate instances in the Milk class.
