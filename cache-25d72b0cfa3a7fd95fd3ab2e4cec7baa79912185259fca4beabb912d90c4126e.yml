  While both garlic paste and minced garlic are forms of garlic used for seasoning
  food, they differ in their texture and preparation method. Garlic paste is made
  by blending or processing garlic cloves into a smooth puree, while minced garlic
  is simply chopped finely using a knife. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
