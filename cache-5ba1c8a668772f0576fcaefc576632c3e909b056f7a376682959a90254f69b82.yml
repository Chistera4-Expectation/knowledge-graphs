text: No, the instances 'Blewit Mushroom' and 'Chicken of the Woods Mushroom' should
  not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct species
  of edible mushrooms with different characteristics, appearances, and flavors. The
  Blewit Mushroom (Clitocybe nuda) is a common edible mushroom with a mild taste,
  while the Chicken of the Woods Mushroom (Laetiporus spp.) is known for its meaty
  texture and flavor resembling chicken. Merging these two instances would create
  confusion and inaccuracies in categorizing and understanding the characteristics
  of each species.
