  Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties, sources,
  and uses. Apricot kernel oil comes from the seeds of the apricot fruit, while argan
  oil is derived from the kernels of the argan tree. The two oils have different nutritional
  profiles, fatty acid compositions, and potential health benefits.
