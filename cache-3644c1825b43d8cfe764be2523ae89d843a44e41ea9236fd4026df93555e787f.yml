text: " No.\n\nBarbecue sauce and Piri Piri sauce are not semantic and ontological\
  \ duplicates even though they both belong to the broader category of sauces. They\
  \ have distinct ingredients, flavors, uses, and cultural origins that make them\
  \ unique from each other. Barbecue sauce typically includes tomato, vinegar, sugar,\
  \ and various spices, while Piri Piri sauce is made with African bird\u2019s eye\
  \ chili peppers, citrus fruits, garlic, onion, oil, and vinegar. Merging these two\
  \ instances would result in loss of valuable information about their individual\
  \ characteristics and applications."
