text: No, "Duck Broth" and "Pheasant Broth" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of poultry-derived
  food, they are distinct types of broth made from different types of poultry. Merging
  them would result in a loss of specificity and information about the ingredients
  and properties of each type of broth.
