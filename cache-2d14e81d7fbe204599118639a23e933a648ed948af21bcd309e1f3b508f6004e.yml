text: Yes, as a dietician, I would consider 'Allspice' and 'Whole allspice berries'
  to be semantic and ontologic duplicates, as they both refer to the same spice, also
  known as Jamaican pepper or pimento. The difference lies in the form of the spice
  (ground or whole berries), but the spice itself remains the same.
