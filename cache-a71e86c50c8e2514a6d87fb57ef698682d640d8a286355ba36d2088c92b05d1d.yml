  Although Arborio rice and white rice are both types of rice, they have different
  properties and uses in cooking due to their differences in texture and taste. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Arborio rice is a type of Italian short-grain rice that is used for making risotto
  because of its high starch content, which gives risotto its creamy consistency.
  White rice, on the other hand, can refer to any number of varieties of milled rice
  that has had its husk, bran, and germ removed, resulting in a polished grain that
  is primarily composed of endosperm. It is a staple food in many cultures around
  the world and is used in various dishes such as fried rice, pilafs, and casseroles.'
