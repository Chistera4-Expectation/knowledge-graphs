text: No, 'Plain Yogurt' and 'Savory Yogurt' should not be merged together as they
  are different types of yogurt with distinct flavor profiles. 'Plain Yogurt' is typically
  unsweetened and unflavored, while 'Savory Yogurt' contains savory ingredients and
  seasonings. Merging them would result in a loss of distinction between the two types.
