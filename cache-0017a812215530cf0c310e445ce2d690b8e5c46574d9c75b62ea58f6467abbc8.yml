text: As a dietician, I would say that while both 'Hibiscus Tea' and 'Infused Tea'
  fall under the general category of tea, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  Hibiscus Tea is a specific type of infused tea made from the hibiscus plant, whereas
  Infused Tea encompasses a broader category of teas that are made by steeping various
  plant materials in hot water. Therefore, the answer is no. They should not be merged
  together as duplicates.
