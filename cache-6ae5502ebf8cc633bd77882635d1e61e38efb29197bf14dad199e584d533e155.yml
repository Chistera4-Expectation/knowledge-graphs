  While pomegranate seeds and watermelon seeds are both types of edible seeds, they
  have distinct nutritional profiles and characteristics that make them unique from
  each other. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological
  duplicates. By keeping these instances separate, we can accurately represent their
  individual properties and provide more precise information for users.'
