  While mustard seeds and pumpkin seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. By keeping
  them separate, we can accurately describe their unique characteristics and help
  people make informed decisions about incorporating these different ingredients into
  their diets.'
