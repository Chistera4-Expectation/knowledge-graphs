  While both baking soda and seasoning cubes can be used to add flavor to food, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different chemical
  properties and uses in cooking. Baking soda is a base that is primarily used as
  a leavening agent in baked goods to make them rise, while seasoning cubes (such
  as bouillon cubes) are typically made from a mixture of salt, MSG, and various spices
  and herbs, and are used to add savory flavors to dishes like soups, stews, and sauces.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as duplicates
  in a Food Seasoning class.'
