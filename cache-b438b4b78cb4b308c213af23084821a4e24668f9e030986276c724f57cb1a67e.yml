text: No, the instances 'Pineapple juice' and 'Vegetable Juice' should not be merged
  as they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Pineapple juice is a specific
  type of fruit juice, while vegetable juice is a broad category that includes various
  types of juices made from different vegetables. Although both are juices, they are
  distinct and should not be merged.
