text: 'As a dietician, I can provide input on the nutritional aspects of sauces, but
  determining whether two instances should be merged or not falls under the domain
  of data modeling and ontology management.


  However, from a nutritional standpoint, ''Sauce'' and ''Tartar sauce'' are not semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. ''Tartar sauce'' is a specific type of sauce, typically
  made with mayonnaise, pickles, and other ingredients, while ''Sauce'' is a more
  general term that can encompass a wide variety of condiments and preparations.'
