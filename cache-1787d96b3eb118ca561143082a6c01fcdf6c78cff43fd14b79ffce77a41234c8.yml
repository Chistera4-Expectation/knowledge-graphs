text: ' It seems there is a misunderstanding in your question. The term "Honeybees"
  refers to the insect species that produce honey, while "Honey" is the substance
  they create. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to call a class for Honeybees
  as just "Honey". Instead, you could consider names like "BeeColony", "ApisMellifera",
  or "Honeybee" for a class representing Honeybees.'
