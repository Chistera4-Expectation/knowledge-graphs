text: No, coconut water and hard water should not be merged together as they are distinctly
  different types of liquids. Coconut water is a natural beverage derived from coconuts,
  while hard water refers to water that contains high levels of minerals, such as
  calcium and magnesium. They have different properties, uses, and nutritional values.
