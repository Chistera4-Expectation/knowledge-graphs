text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both are poultry-derived foods, they differ in their nutritional content, preparation
  methods, and uses in recipes. Chicken broth is a liquid preparation made from simmering
  chicken bones and vegetables, while chicken nuggets are a processed food made from
  ground or chopped chicken meat and often coated with breading. The differences in
  their nutritional profiles and preparation methods make them distinct from each
  other.
