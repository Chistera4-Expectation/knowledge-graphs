text: No, "Chicken Broth" and "Chicken Patties" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from chicken, they are different
  food products with distinct nutritional values and preparation methods. Chicken
  broth is a liquid, while chicken patties are solid. They have different ingredient
  combinations and nutritional profiles, making them separate instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
