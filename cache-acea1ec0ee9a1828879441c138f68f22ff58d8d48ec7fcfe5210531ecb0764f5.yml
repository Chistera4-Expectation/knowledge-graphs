text: ' No. Cherry Blossom Honey and Linden Honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While they both fall under the category of honey, they come from different
  botanical sources (cherry blossoms vs lindens) which gives them distinct flavors,
  colors, and properties. Therefore, it is important to keep these two types of honey
  separate.'
