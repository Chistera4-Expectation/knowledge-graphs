  Fenugreek seeds (Trigonella foenum-graecum) and pumpkin seeds (Cucurbita pepo) are
  distinct types of edible seeds with different nutritional profiles, health benefits,
  and uses. They cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates due to their
  unique properties and differences. Merging them would result in loss of essential
  information regarding each seed type. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep these
  two instances separate in an Edible Seeds class.'
