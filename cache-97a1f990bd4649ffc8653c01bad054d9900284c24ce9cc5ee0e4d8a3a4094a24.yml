text: ' Among the options you provided, "Edible" is implied for all of them as they
  are all edible foods. So I will not consider that part. Also, I will group similar
  types of food together to make it more concise. Here are the approximate calorie
  ranges per 100g serving for each category:


  * Beef, Pork-derived Food, Poultry-derived Food: ~235 calories (for an average mix)

  * Cheese: ~408 calories

  * Butter: ~717 calories

  * Bread, Pasta Types, Rice: ~269 calories (for an average mix)

  * Breakfast Cereal: ~364 calories (for an average mix)

  * Edible Fish, Edible Crustaceans, Edible Mussels: ~113 calories (for an average
  mix)

  * Honey: ~304 calories

  * Milk, Yogurt: ~76 calories (for an average mix)

  * Food Dressing, Sauce, Food Seasoning, Spice, Sweetener: ~100 calories (for an
  average mix)

  * Edible Vegetables, Edible Fruits, Edible Mushrooms, Edible Seeds, Edible Seaweed,
  Edible Vegetable Oils: ~150 calories (for an average mix)


  Based on this analysis, here''s my recommendation for the most adequate class in
  terms of calories:


  * High Calorie: Butter, Cheese

  * Average Calorie: Meats (Beef, Pork-derived Food, and Poultry-derived Food), Grains
  (Bread, Pasta Types, and Rice), Breakfast Cereals, Honey

  * Low Calorie: Edible Fish, Edible Crustaceans, Edible Mussels, Milk, Yogurts, Food
  Dressings, Sauces, Food Seasonings, Spices, Sweeeteners, Edible Vegetables, Edible
  Fruits, Edible Mushrooms, Edible Seeds, Edible Seaweed, Edible Vegetable Oils'
