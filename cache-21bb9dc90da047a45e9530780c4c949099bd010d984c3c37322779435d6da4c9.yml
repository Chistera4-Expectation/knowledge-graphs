text: No, Camel Milk and Hemp Milk should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they both belong to the Milk class, they have distinct nutritional
  profiles, origins, and uses. Camel Milk is derived from camels and is rich in nutrients,
  while Hemp Milk is made from hemp seeds and contains a different nutrient profile,
  including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Merging these two types of milk would
  not accurately represent their unique characteristics and properties.
