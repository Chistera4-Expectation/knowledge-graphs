text: No, Long-grain Rice and Wild Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they may both be considered types of rice, they have distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and uses. Long-grain rice, for example, is typically less
  sticky and more fluffy than other types of rice, while Wild Rice has a nutty flavor
  and is often used in salads or as a side dish. Merging these two instances would
  not accurately represent their unique properties and would lead to confusion.
