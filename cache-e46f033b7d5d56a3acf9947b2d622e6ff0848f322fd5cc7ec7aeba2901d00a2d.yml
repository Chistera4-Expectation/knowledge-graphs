  While both coconut oil and vegetable oil are types of edible oils, they have distinct
  properties, sources, and uses that make them non-duplicate entities in terms of
  their semantics and ontology. Coconut oil is extracted from coconuts, has a high
  saturated fat content, and remains solid at room temperature. In contrast, vegetable
  oil is typically a blend of different plant-based oils (such as soybean, corn, canola,
  etc.), contains varying amounts of unsaturated fats, and stays liquid at room temperature.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
