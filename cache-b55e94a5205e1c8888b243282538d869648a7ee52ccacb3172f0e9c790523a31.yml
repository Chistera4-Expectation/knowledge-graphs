text: No, 'Buffalo Milk' and 'Rice Milk' should not be merged together as they are
  different types of milk with distinct nutritional properties and origins. 'Buffalo
  Milk' comes from buffalo, while 'Rice Milk' is a plant-based milk alternative made
  from rice. They should be considered separate instances in the Milk class.
