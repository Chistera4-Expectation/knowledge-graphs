  While both "Greek Yogurt Dressing" and "Horseradish Dressing" are types of salad
  dressings, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct
  ingredients and flavors. Greek yogurt dressing is typically made with yogurt, herbs,
  and seasonings, while horseradish dressing contains grated horseradish root, vinegar,
  and other ingredients for flavor. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two instances as duplicates.'
