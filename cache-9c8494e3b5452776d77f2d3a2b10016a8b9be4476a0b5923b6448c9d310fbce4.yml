text: No, Lactose-free Butter and Whipped Butter should not be merged as they have
  distinct properties. Lactose-free Butter is a type of butter that has had lactose
  removed or reduced, making it suitable for lactose-intolerant individuals. Whipped
  Butter, on the other hand, is butter that has been aerated, typically through the
  use of a machine, to create a lighter texture and spreadability. While both are
  types of butter, their unique characteristics make them distinct entities.
