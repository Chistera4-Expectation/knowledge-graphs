text: ' No. While corn is a type of vegetable that can be used to make corn masa (a
  dough made from ground dried corn), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Corn masa has been processed and transformed into a new product with different properties
  than whole corn. Therefore, it makes sense to keep them separate within an edible
  vegetable class hierarchy.'
