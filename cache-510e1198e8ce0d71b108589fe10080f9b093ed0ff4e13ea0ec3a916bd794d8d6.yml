text: No, they should not be merged together. While both sources involve spring water,
  'Spring Water' refers specifically to water that comes directly from a spring, while
  'Spring-fed Water' refers to water that is sourced from a spring but may have been
  treated or processed in some way. These are distinct concepts and should be treated
  separately in a classification system.
