text: ' No. Grapeseed oil and sunflower oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they have some similarities as edible vegetable oils. They come from
  different plant sources (grape seeds vs. sunflower seeds) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles, flavors, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them
  as separate entries in an edible vegetable oil classification system.'
