text: No, Lion's Mane Mushroom and Morel Mushroom should not be merged together as
  they are different species of edible mushrooms with distinct characteristics, nutritional
  profiles, and culinary uses. Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus) is a white, shaggy
  mushroom with a seafood-like flavor, while Morel (Morchella species) is a honeycomb-shaped
  mushroom with a meaty, earthy flavor.
