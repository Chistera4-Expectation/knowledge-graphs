text: 'As a dietician, my answer is that "Butter Blend" and "European-style Butter"
  are not necessarily semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under
  the category of butter, they have distinct differences in terms of ingredients,
  production methods, and nutritional content.


  Butter Blend is typically a combination of butter and other fats, such as vegetable
  oil or water, to create a spreadable consistency. This allows for a reduced fat
  content compared to traditional butter.


  European-style Butter, on the other hand, is typically made from cream with a higher
  fat content (around 82-85%) and has been cultured with bacteria, giving it a tangy
  flavor. It is also usually churned for a shorter time, resulting in a smoother texture.


  So, while both products are classified as butter, they have different properties
  and uses. Therefore, merging them as duplicates would not accurately represent their
  distinct characteristics.'
