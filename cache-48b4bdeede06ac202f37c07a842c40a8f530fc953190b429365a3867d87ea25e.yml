text: " No.\n\nWhile both grapeseed oil and soybean oil are types of edible vegetable\
  \ oils, they have distinct properties and uses that make them unique from one another.\
  \ Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic\
  \ and ontological duplicates.\n\nGrapeseed oil is extracted from the seeds of grapes\
  \ and has a light, delicate flavor with a high smoke point, making it suitable for\
  \ saut\xE9ing, frying, and baking at high temperatures. It is also rich in vitamin\
  \ E and linoleic acid.\n\nOn the other hand, soybean oil is derived from soybeans\
  \ and has a mild flavor with a moderate smoke point. It is commonly used in cooking\
  \ and food manufacturing due to its versatility and affordability. Soybean oil is\
  \ also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nMerging these two instances would\
  \ result in the loss of important distinctions between the two types of oils, which\
  \ could lead to confusion and misinformation about their respective nutritional\
  \ profiles and recommended uses."
