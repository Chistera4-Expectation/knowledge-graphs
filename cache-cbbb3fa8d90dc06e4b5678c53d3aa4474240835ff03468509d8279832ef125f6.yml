text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct types of sauces
  with different ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. Hoisin sauce is a Chinese
  sauce made from soybeans, while Marinara sauce is an Italian tomato-based sauce
  typically used for pasta dishes. Although they may both be considered sauces, they
  have unique characteristics and purposes in the culinary world.
