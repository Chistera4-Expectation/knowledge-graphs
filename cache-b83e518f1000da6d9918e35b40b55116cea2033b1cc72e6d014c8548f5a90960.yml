text: " No. Condensed milk and regular milk are not semantic or ontological duplicates.\
  \ While both condensed milk and regular milk come from cows, they have different\
  \ properties and uses due to processing techniques. Regular milk is fresh cow\u2019\
  s milk with minimal processing, while condensed milk undergoes a concentration process\
  \ that removes water and adds sugar for longer shelf life. Therefore, it would not\
  \ be appropriate to merge these two concepts as identical entities."
