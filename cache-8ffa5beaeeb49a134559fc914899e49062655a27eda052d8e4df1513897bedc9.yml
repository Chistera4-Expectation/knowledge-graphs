text: No, Jasmine Rice and Red Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct properties, appearances,
  and uses. Jasmine Rice is a long-grain, aromatic rice from Thailand, while Red Rice
  is a short-grain, nutty-flavored rice with a reddish-brown color.
