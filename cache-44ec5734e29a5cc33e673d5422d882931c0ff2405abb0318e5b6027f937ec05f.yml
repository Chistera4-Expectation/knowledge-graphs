text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are sauces, they have different
  ingredients and characteristics. Beurre blanc sauce is a French butter sauce made
  with white wine, vinegar, and shallots, while tartar sauce is a cold sauce made
  with mayonnaise, chopped pickles, and other ingredients. They serve different purposes
  and are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
