text: No, "Eucalyptus Honey" and "Raspberry Honey" should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct types of honey with different
  flavors, colors, and properties, based on the plants from which they are derived
  (eucalyptus and raspberry, respectively). Each type of honey has unique characteristics
  that are important for dietary purposes and other applications.
