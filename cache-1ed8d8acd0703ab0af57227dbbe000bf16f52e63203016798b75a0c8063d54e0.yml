text: No, Cranberry juice and Vegetable Juice should not be merged together as they
  are distinct types of juices with different ingredients and nutritional profiles.
  They may share some common properties (e.g., being liquid and containing some vitamins),
  but they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
