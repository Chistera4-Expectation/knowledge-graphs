  While canola oil and cottonseed oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, production methods,
  and uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Canola oil is derived from rapeseed plants and has a higher concentration
  of monounsaturated fats compared to cottonseed oil, which contains more polyunsaturated
  fatty acids. Additionally, the production processes for these two oils differ significantly,
  with canola oil undergoing additional refining steps to remove erucic acid and glucosinolates
  that are present in rapeseed oil. These unique characteristics make canola oil and
  cottonseed oil separate entities within the category of edible vegetable oils.'
