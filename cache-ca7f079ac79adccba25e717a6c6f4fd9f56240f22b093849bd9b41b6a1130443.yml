text: No, "Quail Wings" and "Turkey Wings" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of poultry wings, they come
  from different species of birds with distinct nutritional profiles, cooking properties,
  and cultural significance. Merging them together would result in a loss of specificity
  and potentially inaccurate dietary advice.
