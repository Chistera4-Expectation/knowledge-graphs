text: No, they should not be merged. While both 'Grilled Bread' and 'Naan Bread' are
  types of bread, they have distinct characteristics and preparation methods. 'Grilled
  Bread' typically refers to bread that has been cooked on a grill or griddle, while
  'Naan Bread' is a type of leavened flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent.
  Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and information about each type
  of bread.
