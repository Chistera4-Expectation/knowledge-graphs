text: ' No. Buckwheat honey and eucalyptus honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of honey. They come from different floral sources (buckwheat
  flowers vs eucalyptus plants) which gives them distinct nutritional profiles, flavors,
  colors, and uses in cooking and natural remedies. Therefore, they should remain
  separate classes.'
