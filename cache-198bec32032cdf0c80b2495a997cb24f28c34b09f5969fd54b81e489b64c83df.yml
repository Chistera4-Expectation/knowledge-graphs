text: No, they should not be merged together. Distilled water and flavored water have
  distinct properties and uses. Distilled water is purified water that has had impurities
  and minerals removed, while flavored water contains added flavors and may contain
  sweeteners or other additives. They serve different purposes and are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
