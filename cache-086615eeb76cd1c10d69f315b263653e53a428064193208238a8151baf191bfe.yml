  While both chicken parmesan and chicken wings are types of dishes that feature chicken
  as the main ingredient, they have different preparations and culinary uses. Chicken
  parmesan is made by breading and frying chicken cutlets before topping them with
  tomato sauce and melted cheese, while chicken wings typically consist of deep-fried
  or b grilled wings coated in various sauces. Therefore, they cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates.'
