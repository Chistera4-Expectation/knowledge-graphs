text: No, Corn husks and Cornmeal should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they both originate from corn, they have different properties,
  uses, and nutritional values. Corn husks are the outer covering of corn ears and
  are often used for wrapping food during cooking, while Cornmeal is ground corn used
  for various dishes and baking purposes. They are not interchangeable in culinary
  applications or nutritional content.
