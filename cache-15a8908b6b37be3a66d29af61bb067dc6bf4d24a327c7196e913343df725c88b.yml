text: ' No. Lasagna noodles and rice vermicelli noodles are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged together. Although they both fall under the
  general category of "noodles," they have distinct characteristics and uses that
  make them unique from one another. Lasagna noodles are typically wide and flat and
  used in layered dishes like lasagna, while rice vermicelli noodles are thin and
  often used in soups and stir-fries. Therefore, it is important to maintain these
  distinctions when discussing different types of pasta.'
