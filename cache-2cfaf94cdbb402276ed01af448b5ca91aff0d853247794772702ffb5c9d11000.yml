text: No, the instances 'Blue Crab' and 'King Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates because they are distinct species with unique
  characteristics, habitats, and culinary uses. While both are edible crustaceans,
  they belong to different genera and families, and each has its own set of nutritional
  and culinary properties.
