text: No, 'Chicken Gravy' and 'Duck Gravy' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they share some similarities as gravy made from
  poultry, they are distinct foods made from different types of poultry, chicken and
  duck, respectively. The taste, nutritional content, and preparation methods may
  vary between the two.
