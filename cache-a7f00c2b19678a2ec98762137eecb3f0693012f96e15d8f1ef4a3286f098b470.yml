text: No, "Creamy Yogurt" and "Icelandic Yogurt" should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different types of yogurt with distinct characteristics.
  Creamy yogurt is characterized by its smooth and creamy texture, while Icelandic
  yogurt, also known as skyr, is a thicker and creamier type of yogurt that is strained
  to remove excess whey.
