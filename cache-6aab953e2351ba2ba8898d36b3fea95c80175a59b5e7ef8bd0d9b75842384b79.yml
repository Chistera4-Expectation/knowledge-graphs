text: ' "Silkworm Diet" or "Sericulture Diet" could be appropriate classes for the
  diet of silkworms. These names reflect the specific focus on what is suitable to
  feed silkworms, which is primarily mulberry leaves in their larval stage. While
  honey and insect-derived food can be part of other diets, they are not typically
  included in the diet of silkworms.'
