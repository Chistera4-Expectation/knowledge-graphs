  The two instances, "Chai tea" and "Matcha green tea powder," are not identical in
  their composition, preparation method, or nutritional content. Chai tea is a spiced
  tea that typically includes black tea, milk, sugar, and spices like cinnamon, cardamom,
  and ginger. Matcha green tea powder, on the other hand, is made from ground green
  tea leaves and does not contain milk or added sugars. Therefore, they cannot be
  considered semantic and ontological duplicates.'
