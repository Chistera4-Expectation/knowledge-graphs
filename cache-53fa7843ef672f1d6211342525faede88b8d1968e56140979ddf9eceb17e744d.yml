text: No, they should not be merged. While both are types of sauces, they have distinct
  ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. Curry sauce typically contains spices
  like turmeric and cumin, whereas Hoisin sauce is made with soybeans, garlic, and
  sweeteners. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between
  the two.
