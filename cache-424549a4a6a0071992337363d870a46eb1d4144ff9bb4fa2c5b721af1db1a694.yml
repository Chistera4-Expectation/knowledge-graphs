text: No, Blueberry Honey and Manuka Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of honey, they have different properties,
  origins, and uses. Blueberry Honey is derived from the nectar of blueberry flowers,
  while Manuka Honey comes from the nectar of the Manuka tree in New Zealand. They
  also have distinct nutritional profiles and potential health benefits.
