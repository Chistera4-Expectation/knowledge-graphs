  Chicken breasts and low-sodium chicken broth are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While both are derived from poultry, they have different nutritional profiles and
  uses in cooking. Chicken breasts are a source of lean protein, while low-sodium
  chicken broth is primarily water with some added flavor and electrolytes (such as
  sodium). Merging these two concepts would result in loss of important distinctions.'
