  While safflower oil and soybean oil may share some general properties as types of
  edible vegetable oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come
  from different plants (safflowers vs. soybeans), have distinct nutritional profiles,
  and are used for various culinary purposes. Therefore, it is essential to maintain
  these distinctions when discussing or categorizing them.'
