text: ' Here are some possible instances that could be included in a `Sweetener` class:


  1. Natural sweeteners, such as honey and maple syrup

  2. Artificial sweeteners, such as saccharin (Sweet''N Low), aspartame (Equal), sucralose
  (Splenda)

  3. Sugar alcohols, such as xylitol, sorbitol, and erythritol

  4. Stevia, a natural low-calorie sweetener derived from the leaves of the stevia
  plant

  5. Monk fruit extract, another natural low-calorie sweetener


  Each instance of the `Sweetener` class would have its own set of attributes, such
  as:


  * Name

  * Calories per teaspoon

  * Glycemic index

  * Any potential health benefits or risks associated with consumption

  * Whether it is considered to be "natural" or "artificial"


  These attributes could then be used to compare different types of sweeteners and
  make recommendations to clients based on their individual needs and goals.'
