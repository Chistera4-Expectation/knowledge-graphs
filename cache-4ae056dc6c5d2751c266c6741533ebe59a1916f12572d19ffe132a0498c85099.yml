  While both pork loin and roasted pork are types of pork, they are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates because they refer to different stages of processing and
  preparation. Pork loin is a specific cut from the pig, while roasted pork can refer
  to any part of the pig that has been cooked by roasting. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
