text: 'As a dietician, my focus is on the nutritional aspects of food and drink. From
  a nutritional perspective, Ginger Tea and White Tea have different properties and
  potential health benefits. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.


  Ginger Tea is made from the root of the ginger plant, and it is known for its anti-inflammatory
  and digestive properties. White Tea, on the other hand, is made from the young leaves
  of the Camellia sinensis plant and is known for its high antioxidant content and
  potential benefits for heart health, skin health, and more.


  Merging these two types of tea would result in a loss of important information regarding
  their distinct nutritional and health benefits.'
