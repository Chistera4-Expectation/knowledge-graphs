text: ' No. Creamy Italian Dressing and Soy Sauce Dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. While they may both be used as dressings, they have distinct ingredients
  and flavors. Creamy Italian Dressing is typically made with a base of mayonnaise
  or cream, milk, vinegar, olive oil, garlic, onion, and various herbs and spices
  for an Italian flavor. Soy Sauce Dressing, on the other hand, is primarily made
  from soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, ginger, and garlic. These two types of dressings
  serve different purposes in terms of taste and culinary applications.'
