text: ' No. Jamaican Jerk Seasoning and Seasoning Cubes are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, and they should not be merged together. While both may be used to add
  flavor to food, they have different ingredients, uses, and cultural origins. Jamaican
  Jerk Seasoning typically consists of allspice, thyme, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger,
  garlic, onion, pepper, and salt, among other possible spices, while seasoning cubes
  (such as bouillon cubes) usually contain high amounts of salt, MSG, and various
  dehydrated vegetables. Merging these two concepts would result in loss of specificity
  and could create confusion for users seeking information about either one individually.'
