text: No, Bluefish and Catfish should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are edible fish, they are distinct species with different
  characteristics, habitats, and nutritional profiles. Merging them would result in
  a loss of specific information and potentially lead to confusion.
