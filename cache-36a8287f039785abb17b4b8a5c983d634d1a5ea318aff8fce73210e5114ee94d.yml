text: No, the instances 'Crab' and 'Horseshoe Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are crustaceans, they belong
  to different taxonomic families and have distinct characteristics and nutritional
  profiles. Crabs are true crustaceans belonging to the order Decapoda, while Horseshoe
  Crabs are more closely related to arachnids and belong to the class Merostomata.
