text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  "Butter Blend" and "Spreadable Butter" may be similar in their purpose, they are
  not identical. Butter blend typically refers to a mixture of butter with other oils
  or fats, whereas spreadable butter is usually regular butter that has been altered
  to be softened or creamed to make it easier to spread. They have different compositions
  and may serve different purposes for users, so they should be kept as separate classes
  or categories.
