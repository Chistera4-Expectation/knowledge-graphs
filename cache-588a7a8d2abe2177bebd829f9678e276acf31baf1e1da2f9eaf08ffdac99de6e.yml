text: No, Quail Eggs and Quail should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although they both fall under the Poultry-derived Food class, they are distinct
  entities with different nutritional profiles and uses in culinary applications.
  Quail Eggs refer specifically to the eggs produced by Quail, while Quail refers
  to the bird itself.
