text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are considered vegetables
  and may be used in similar ways in recipes, potatoes and sweet potatoes are botanically
  distinct and have different nutritional profiles. They belong to different plant
  families and have different nutritional and culinary properties. Therefore, they
  should be treated as separate instances within the Edible Vegetable class.
