text: No, European-style Butter and Grass-fed Butter should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they share similarities, they are distinct types
  of butter. European-style Butter typically has a higher fat content (around 82-86%)
  and is cultured, while Grass-fed Butter comes from cows that are fed primarily grass,
  which may affect its nutritional profile and flavor.
