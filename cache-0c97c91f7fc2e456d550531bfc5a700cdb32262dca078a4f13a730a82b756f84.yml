text: ' No. While rice noodles and rice vermicelli are both types of noodles made
  from rice, they have distinct differences in shape, size, and usage in cooking that
  make them separate entities rather than semantic or ontological duplicates. Rice
  noodles can come in various widths and lengths, while rice vermicelli is very thin,
  similar to angel hair pasta. Merging these two terms would not accurately reflect
  their unique culinary properties and applications.'
