  While "Additional seasonings" is a general term that could include many different
  types of seasonings, "Jamaican Jerk Seasoning" refers to a specific type of seasoning
  blend with its own unique ingredients and flavor profile. Therefore, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates and should remain separate instances.'
