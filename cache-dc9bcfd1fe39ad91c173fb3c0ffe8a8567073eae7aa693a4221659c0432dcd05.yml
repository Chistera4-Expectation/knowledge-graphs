text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are soups derived from poultry, "Chicken Soup" is made from chicken, and "Guinea
  Fowl Soup" is made from guinea fowl, which are two different types of birds. Although
  they share a common class (Poultry-derived Food), they are distinct types of soups.
