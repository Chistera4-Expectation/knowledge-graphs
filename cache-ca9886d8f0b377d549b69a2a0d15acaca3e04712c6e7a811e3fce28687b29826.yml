  Creamy Garlic Dressing and Sesame Ginger Dressing are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they have different ingredients and flavor profiles. Creamy Garlic
  Dressing typically contains dairy-based ingredients such as mayonnaise or sour cream,
  along with garlic, herbs, and spices. On the other hand, Sesame Ginger Dressing
  is usually made with sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger, vinegar, and sweeteners like
  honey or sugar. Therefore, these two dressings serve distinct purposes and appeal
  to different taste preferences, making them non-duplicative both from a semantic
  (meaning) and an ontological (category membership) perspective.'
