text: No, they should not be merged together. Coconut milk and lactose-free milk are
  different types of milk with distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles.
  Coconut milk is derived from coconut meat, while lactose-free milk is regular cow's
  milk with lactase enzyme added to break down lactose. They should be treated as
  separate instances in the Milk class.
