text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are types of syrups, they have distinct chemical compositions and properties.
  Date syrup is primarily composed of fructose, glucose, and sucrose from dates, while
  maltose syrup is made up of maltose, glucose, and maltotriose from starch hydrolysis.
  These differences in composition would impact their nutritional content, glycemic
  index, and potential uses in recipes.
