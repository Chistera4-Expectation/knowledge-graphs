text: No, the instances 'Redfish' and 'Sashimi-grade fish' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible fish, they are different
  species and have distinct characteristics, such as taste, texture, and preparation
  methods. Redfish is a type of fish belonging to the Sciaenidae family, while sashimi-grade
  fish can refer to any fish suitable for raw consumption in Japanese cuisine, such
  as tuna or salmon.
