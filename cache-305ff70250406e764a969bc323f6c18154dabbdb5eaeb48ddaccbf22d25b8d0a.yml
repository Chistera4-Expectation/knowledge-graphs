  The terms "sliced tomatoes" and "tomato" refer to different forms of the same vegetable,
  with distinct textures and uses in cooking. While they share some similarities in
  nutritional value, they are not interchangeable in all contexts. Sliced tomatoes
  have a higher surface area and are often used in sandwiches, salads, and as a garnish,
  while cherry tomatoes are typically consumed whole and are popular in snacking,
  pasta dishes, and sauces. From a culinary perspective, they can be considered separate
  entities, making them not identical duplicates.'
