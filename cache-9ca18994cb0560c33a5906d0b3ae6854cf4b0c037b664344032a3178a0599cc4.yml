text: ' No. While sodium and sugar are both types of nutrients, they serve different
  purposes in the body and have different health implications. Therefore, it is important
  to track their intake separately rather than merging them into a single category.
  Sodium helps regulate fluid balance and nerve function, while added sugars contribute
  to empty calories and can lead to weight gain, tooth decay, and other negative health
  outcomes if consumed in excess.'
