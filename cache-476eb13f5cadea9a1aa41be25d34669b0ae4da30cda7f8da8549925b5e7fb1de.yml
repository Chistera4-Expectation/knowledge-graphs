text: No, "Distilled Water" and "Hard Water" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of water with different properties
  and uses. Distilled water is water that has been boiled into vapor and condensed
  back into liquid in a separate container, leaving most solid contaminants behind.
  Hard water, on the other hand, is water with a high mineral content, particularly
  calcium and magnesium ions, which can cause issues in some applications.
