  While "fresh cilantro leaves" are a part of the fresh cilantro plant that is typically
  consumed, they differ from "fresh cilantro" in their specificity. Fresh cilantro
  can refer to the entire plant, including stems and roots, while fresh cilantro leaves
  specifically refers to just the leafy portion of the plant. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
