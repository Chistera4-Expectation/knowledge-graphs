  While both Greek yogurt dressing and honey mustard dressing may fall under the category
  of "salad dressings," they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates because they
  have different ingredients, flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles. Greek yogurt
  dressing typically contains Greek yogurt, herbs, spices, and sometimes lemon juice,
  while honey mustard dressing is made with mustard, honey, vinegar, and possibly
  oil. These differences make them distinct food items that cannot be considered duplicates
  from either a semantic (meaning) or an ontological (category membership) perspective.'
