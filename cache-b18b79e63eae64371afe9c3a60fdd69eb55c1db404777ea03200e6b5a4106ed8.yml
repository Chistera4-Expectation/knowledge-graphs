text: No, they should not be merged. Wonton wrappers and chili peppers are different
  types of food items and serve different purposes in cooking. Wonton wrappers are
  typically used for making dumplings or appetizers, while chili peppers are used
  to add spice and flavor to dishes. They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
