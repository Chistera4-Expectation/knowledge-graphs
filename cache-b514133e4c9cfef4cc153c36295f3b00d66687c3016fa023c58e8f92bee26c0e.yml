text: No, Chili oil and Wheat Germ oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetal oils, they have distinct
  properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Chili oil is made from chili peppers
  and has a spicy flavor, while Wheat Germ oil is derived from the germ of the wheat
  kernel and is rich in essential fatty acids and vitamin E. They serve different
  purposes in cooking and have unique health benefits.
