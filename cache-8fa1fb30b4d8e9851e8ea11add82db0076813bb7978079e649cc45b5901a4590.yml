text: No, the instances 'Fish stock' and 'Stockfish' should not be merged together
  as they represent different concepts. 'Fish stock' refers to the liquid extracted
  from boiling fish bones and other fish parts, while 'Stockfish' is a specific type
  of dried fish, typically made from cod or other whitefish. They are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates.
