text: ' No. Cream cheese and Swiss cheese are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They have distinct properties and uses, despite
  both being types of cheese. For example, cream cheese is typically mild and spreadable
  with high-fat content, while Swiss cheese has a nutty flavor and distinctive holes
  (eyes) caused by gas bubbles formed during fermentation. Merging them would result
  in loss of valuable information about each type of cheese.'
