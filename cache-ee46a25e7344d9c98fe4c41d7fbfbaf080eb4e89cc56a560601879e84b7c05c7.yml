  While both "chicken breasts" and "grilled chicken" are types of poultry-derived
  food, they do not represent identical concepts. Chicken breasts refer to a specific
  cut from a chicken, while grilled chicken can consist of various cuts (including
  chicken breasts) that have been cooked using a grilling method. Therefore, these
  two instances cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates.'
