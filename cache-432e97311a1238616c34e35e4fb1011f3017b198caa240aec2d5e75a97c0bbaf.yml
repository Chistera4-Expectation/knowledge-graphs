text: No, the instances 'Papaya juice' and 'Watermelon juice' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they both fall under the
  category of 'juice,' they are distinct types of juice with unique flavors, nutritional
  profiles, and ingredients. Merging them together would not accurately represent
  the variety and specificity of juices available.
