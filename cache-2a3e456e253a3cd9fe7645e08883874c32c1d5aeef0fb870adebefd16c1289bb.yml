  While both cholesterol and sodium are related to health and nutrition, they are
  not duplicates of each other from either a semantic or an ontological perspective.
  Semantically, "cholesterol" and "sodium" have distinct meanings and refer to different
  nutritional components found in cheese. Ontologically, they belong to separate categories:
  cholesterol is a type of lipid (fat), while sodium is an electrolyte and mineral.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two attributes into one field.'
