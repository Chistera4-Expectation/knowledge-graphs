text: No, 'Ceylon Tea' and 'Rooibos Tea' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of tea, they have distinct characteristics, origins,
  and flavors. Ceylon Tea is a black tea from Sri Lanka, while Rooibos Tea is a red
  tea from South Africa. Each type of tea has unique nutritional properties and health
  benefits, so it is essential to distinguish them.
