text: No, they should not be merged together. Pea milk and whole milk are distinct
  types of milk with different nutritional compositions, origins, and production methods.
  Pea milk is made from pea protein, while whole milk is derived from cow's milk.
  Merging them together would result in the loss of important information and could
  lead to confusion when providing dietary advice.
