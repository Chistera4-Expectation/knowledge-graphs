text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although they both come from the same source (guinea fowl), they are different food
  products with distinct preparation methods and uses. Guinea Fowl Nuggets are a processed,
  breaded and fried product, while Guinea Fowl Stock is a liquid broth made by simmering
  guinea fowl bones, vegetables, and herbs. These differences make them distinct entities
  in a Poultry-derived Food class.
