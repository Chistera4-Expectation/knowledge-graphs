  The two instances, "Fruit wine" and "Shaoxing wine," are not identical in terms
  of their ingredients, production process, or taste profile. Fruit wines are made
  from fermented fruit juice, while Shaoxing wine is a type of Chinese rice wine that
  uses glutinous rice as its primary ingredient. Therefore, they cannot be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
