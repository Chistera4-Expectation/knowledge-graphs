text: No, Argan Oil and Corn Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct chemical compositions,
  sources, and uses. Argan Oil is derived from the kernels of the argan tree, native
  to Morocco, and is rich in vitamin E, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids. It
  is commonly used in culinary applications and as a cosmetic ingredient. Corn Oil,
  on the other hand, is derived from corn (maize) and is a common cooking oil with
  a high smoke point. The two oils have different nutritional profiles and applications,
  making them distinct from one another.
