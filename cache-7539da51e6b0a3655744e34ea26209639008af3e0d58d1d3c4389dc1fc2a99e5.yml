text: As a dietician, I can provide input from a nutritional standpoint, but the decision
  on merging instances in a class is a matter of semantics and ontology, which is
  more suitable for a knowledge engineer or a domain expert. However, I can say that
  'Dark soy sauce' and 'Sauce' are not necessarily semantic and ontologic duplicates,
  as 'Dark soy sauce' is a specific type of sauce, while 'Sauce' is a more general
  term encompassing a wide range of condiments and ingredients.
