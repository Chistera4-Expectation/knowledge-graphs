text: No, they should not be merged. While both spreadable and whipped butter are
  types of butter that can be easily spread, they have different properties and textures
  due to their respective production methods. Spreadable butter typically contains
  a higher percentage of oil, making it softer at room temperature, while whipped
  butter has been aerated, giving it a lighter texture. Therefore, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
