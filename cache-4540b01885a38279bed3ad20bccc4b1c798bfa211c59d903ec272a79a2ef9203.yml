text: ' No. Dried red pepper flakes and red chili powder are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they may seem similar at first glance. While both spices
  can add heat to dishes, they have different flavors and textures due to their unique
  ingredients and preparation methods. Therefore, it is essential to distinguish between
  them when providing nutritional information and culinary advice.'
