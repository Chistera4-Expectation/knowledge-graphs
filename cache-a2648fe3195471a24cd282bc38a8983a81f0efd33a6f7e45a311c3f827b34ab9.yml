text: No, they should not be merged together. Green peas and other leafy greens are
  different types of vegetables with distinct nutritional profiles and characteristics.
  Green peas are legumes, while leafy greens include vegetables like spinach, kale,
  and lettuce. Although both types of vegetables are considered healthy and part of
  a balanced diet, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
