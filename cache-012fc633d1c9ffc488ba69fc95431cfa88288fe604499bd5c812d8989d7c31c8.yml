text: No, 'Pheasant Meat' and 'Pheasant Soup' should not be merged together as they
  are not semantic and ontological duplicates. 'Pheasant Meat' refers to the meat
  itself, while 'Pheasant Soup' refers to a dish made with the meat. Although they
  share the same base ingredient, they represent different concepts and should be
  treated as separate instances.
