text: As a dietician, I can provide some insights, but the classification of water
  types is not strictly within my domain expertise. However, from a general perspective,
  'Artisanal Water' and 'Spring-fed Water' are not entirely synonymous. Artisanal
  water typically refers to water sourced from a specific artesian aquifer, while
  spring-fed water is sourced from a natural spring. Therefore, while there might
  be some overlap in their qualities, they are not exactly the same and should not
  be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.
