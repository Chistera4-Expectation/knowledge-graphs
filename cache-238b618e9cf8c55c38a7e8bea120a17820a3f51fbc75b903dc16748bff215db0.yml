  While both pomegranate seeds and sunflower seeds come from fruits and are often
  consumed for their nutritional benefits, they belong to different botanical families
  and have distinct nutrient profiles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Pomegranate seeds (botanically known
  as arils) contain high levels of antioxidants, vitamin C, and fiber, while sunflower
  seeds provide essential fatty acids like linoleic acid, vitamin E, and minerals
  such as magnesium and selenium. Keeping these two seed types separate allows for
  accurate representation of their unique nutritional properties and uses in diets
  and recipes.'
