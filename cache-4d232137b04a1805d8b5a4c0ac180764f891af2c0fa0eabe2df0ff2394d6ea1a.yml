  While both Carbohydrates per serving and Grated Parmesan cheese are related to nutrition
  and food, they represent different types of information and cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates.


  Carbohydrates per serving is a nutritional value that can apply to many different
  foods, including grated parmesan cheese. On the other hand, Grated Parmesan cheese
  refers specifically to a type of cheese and its characteristics, which may include
  various nutritional values such as carbohydrates per serving. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two instances into one.'
