text: No, Sparkling Water and Tap Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they both fall under the category of drinking
  water, they have distinct properties and uses. Sparkling water contains carbonation,
  while tap water does not. These differences make them unique and not semantic duplicates.
