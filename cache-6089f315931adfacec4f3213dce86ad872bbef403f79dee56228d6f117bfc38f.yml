text: No, 'Turkey Gravy' and 'Turkey Stock' should not be merged together as they
  are two distinct food items with different characteristics and uses in cooking.
  Turkey Gravy is a thickened sauce made from turkey drippings, while Turkey Stock
  is a flavorful liquid made by simmering turkey bones and meat scraps. Although they
  share a common base ingredient (turkey), their preparation, consistency, and culinary
  applications differ significantly.
