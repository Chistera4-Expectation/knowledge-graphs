text: ' No. While chili peppers and Scotch bonnet peppers are both types of peppers,
  they have distinct characteristics that make them unique from one another. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Chili peppers are a broader category of peppers that include many different
  varieties, while Scotch bonnet peppers are a specific type of chili pepper with
  their own unique flavor profile and heat level.'
