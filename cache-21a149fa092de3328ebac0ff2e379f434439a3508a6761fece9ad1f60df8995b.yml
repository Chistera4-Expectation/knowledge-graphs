text: ' No. Although fenugreek seeds and flaxseeds have some similarities (for example,
  they are both sources of fiber), they also have important differences in terms of
  their nutritional content and potential health benefits. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. It is important to maintain
  separate listings for each type of seed in order to accurately represent their unique
  characteristics and uses.'
