text: No, the instances 'Oyster Mushroom' and 'Velvet Pioppini Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are edible
  mushrooms, they belong to different species and have distinct characteristics, nutritional
  profiles, and culinary uses. Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) are common and
  widely cultivated, while Velvet Pioppini mushrooms (Agrocybe aegerita) are less
  common and have a more distinct flavor profile. Therefore, they should be treated
  as separate entities in the context of an edible mushroom classification system.
