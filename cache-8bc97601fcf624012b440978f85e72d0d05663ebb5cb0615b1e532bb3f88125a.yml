  While "Fruit-Infused Water" and "Water" are both beverages, they are distinct concepts
  and categories of beverages. Fruit-Infused Water is a subcategory of Flavored Waters,
  while Water is a standalone category of beverages. Merging them together would not
  accurately represent the ontological structure of the domain.'
