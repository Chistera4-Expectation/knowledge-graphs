text: No, Morel Mushroom and Oyster Mushroom should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms, they are distinct species
  with unique characteristics, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Merging them
  would lead to a loss of important information and confuse users.
