  While fenugreek seeds and mustard seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, taste, uses, and health benefits. Therefore, it is
  not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Here are some
  key differences between the two:


  1. Nutritional profile: Fenugreek seeds contain more fiber, protein, and minerals
  like iron, magnesium, and manganese than mustard seeds. On the other hand, mustard
  seeds have higher amounts of fatty acids, vitamin E, and B-vitamins such as thiamin,
  riboflavin, niacin, and folate compared to fenugreek seeds.

  2. Taste: Fenugreek seeds have a sweet, nutty flavor with a slightly bitter aftertaste,
  while mustard seeds possess a sharp, pungent taste due to their volatile oils.

  3. Uses: Fenugreek seeds are commonly used in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines
  for making curries, spice blends, and teas. They also have traditional medicinal
  applications for treating digestive issues, lowering blood sugar levels, and increasing
  milk production in breastfeeding women. In contrast, mustard seeds are widely employed
  as condiments (mustards), pickling agents, and seasonings in various global cuisines.
  Additionally, they offer potential health advantages related to anti-inflammation,
  pain relief, and improved cardiovascular function.


  Given these distinctions, merging fenugreek seeds and mustard seeds into one category
  would disregard their unique characteristics, potentially leading to confusion regarding
  proper usage and misinterpretations about their individual health effects.'
