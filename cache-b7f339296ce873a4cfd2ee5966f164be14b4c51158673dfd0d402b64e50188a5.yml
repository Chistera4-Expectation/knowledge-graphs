text: No, they should not be merged. Fish stock and sashimi-grade fish have different
  characteristics, purposes, and preparation methods. Fish stock is a liquid made
  by simmering fish bones, heads, or other parts to extract flavor, while sashimi-grade
  fish refers to a type of fish suitable for raw consumption in dishes like sashimi
  and sushi. These are distinct concepts in the realm of edible fish.
