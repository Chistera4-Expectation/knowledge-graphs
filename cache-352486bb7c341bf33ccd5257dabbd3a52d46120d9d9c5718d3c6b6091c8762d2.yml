text: No, they should not be merged together as they have distinct differences in
  their composition and properties. Clarified butter is made by removing the milk
  solids and water from regular butter, while grass-fed butter is made from the milk
  of cows that are fed on grass rather than grains. Although both are types of butter,
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates due to these differences.
