text: ' No. While both "Frank''s RedHot Sauce" and "hot peppers" can add heat to food
  and may share some culinary uses, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Frank''s RedHot Sauce is a specific brand of bottled hot sauce made from aged cayenne
  red peppers and other ingredients, while hot peppers refer to any pepper variety
  that has been bred for its spicy flavor and includes many fresh and dried types
  such as jalapenos, habaneros, and serranos. Merging these two concepts would result
  in loss of important distinctions between different food items.'
