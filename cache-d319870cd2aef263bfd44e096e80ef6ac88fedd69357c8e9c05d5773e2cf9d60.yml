text: No, the instances 'Dandelion Honey' and 'Raw Honey' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of honey, they are distinct
  in terms of their source and processing methods. Dandelion honey is derived from
  dandelion flowers, while raw honey is unprocessed and unheated, preserving its natural
  enzymes and nutrients.
