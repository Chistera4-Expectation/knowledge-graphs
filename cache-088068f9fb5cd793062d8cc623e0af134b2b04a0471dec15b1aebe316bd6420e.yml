  While both avocado dressing and ranch dressing can be categorized under the broader
  concept of "salad dressings," they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates because
  they have distinct ingredients and flavor profiles that make them unique from one
  another. Avocado dressing is typically made with mashed avocados, while ranch dressing
  is usually made with buttermilk, mayonnaise, and herbs. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge these two concepts together as they represent different
  culinary entities.'
