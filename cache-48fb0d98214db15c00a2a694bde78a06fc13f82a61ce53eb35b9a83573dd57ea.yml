  While both olive oil and pumpkin seed oil are types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct properties that make them unique and not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Olive oil is typically high in monounsaturated fats, has a fruity flavor, and is
  commonly used in Mediterranean cooking, while pumpkin seed oil is higher in polyunsaturated
  fats, has a nutty flavor, and is often used for salad dressings and finishing dishes.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
