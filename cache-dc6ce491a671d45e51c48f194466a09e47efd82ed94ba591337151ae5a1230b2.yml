text: No, the instances 'Gluten-Free Bread' and 'Naan Bread' should not be merged
  together as they are different types of bread with distinct properties and characteristics.
  Gluten-Free Bread is made without wheat, barley, or rye, while Naan Bread is a type
  of leavened bread from the Indian subcontinent, typically made with wheat flour.
  Merging them would not accurately represent their unique qualities and uses.
