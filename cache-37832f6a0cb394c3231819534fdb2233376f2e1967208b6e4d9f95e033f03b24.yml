text: No, these instances should not be merged together. Although they both are types
  of sauces, they have distinct characteristics and flavors, making them unique entities.
  Barbecue sauce typically has a sweet and tangy flavor, while Scotch bonnet pepper
  sauce is known for its spicy and hot flavor. Merging them would result in a loss
  of specific information about each sauce.
