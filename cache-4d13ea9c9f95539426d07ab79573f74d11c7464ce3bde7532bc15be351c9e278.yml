text: ' No. Although basil leaves and fresh cilantro leaves are both types of herbs
  used for flavoring food, they have distinct tastes, appearances, textures, and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They belong to different plant species (Ocimum basilicum and Coriandrum
  sativum, respectively) and serve unique roles in cooking.'
