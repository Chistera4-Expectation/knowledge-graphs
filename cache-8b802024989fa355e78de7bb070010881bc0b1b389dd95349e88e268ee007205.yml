text: No, they should not be merged as they are two distinct seasonings with different
  ingredients and uses. Five-spice powder is a blend of five spices, typically including
  star anise, cloves, Chinese cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds, while rice
  vinegar is a type of vinegar made from fermented rice. They serve different purposes
  in cooking and have unique flavors.
