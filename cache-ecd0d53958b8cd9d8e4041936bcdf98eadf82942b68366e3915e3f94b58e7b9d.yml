text: No, European-style Butter and Unsalted Butter should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of butter, they have distinct characteristics.
  European-style butter typically has a higher fat content and a richer flavor due
  to the use of cream with a higher fat percentage and a specific churning process.
  Unsalted butter, on the other hand, is simply butter without added salt, allowing
  for more control over the salt content in recipes. These differences make them distinct
  types of butter.
