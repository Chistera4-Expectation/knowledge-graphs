text: ' No. While Caesar Dressing and Creamy Italian Dressing may share some similarities
  in terms of their creaminess and use of ingredients like oil, vinegar, and herbs,
  they are distinct salad dressings with unique flavors and recipes. Therefore, they
  should not be merged as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
