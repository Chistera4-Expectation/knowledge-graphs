  While diced onions and green onions may both fall under the general category of
  "vegetables" and can be used in similar ways in cooking (e.g., as flavorings), they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Diced onions refer specifically to white
  or yellow onions that have been cut into small pieces, while green onions (also
  known as scallions) are long, thin vegetables with a milder flavor than regular
  onions. They belong to different species within the genus Allium and have distinct
  nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate and distinguish
  between them in any classification system for edible vegetables.'
