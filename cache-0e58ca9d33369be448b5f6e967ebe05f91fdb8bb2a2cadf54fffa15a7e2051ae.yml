text: As a dietician, my answer is no, the instances 'Duck Breast' and 'Duck' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived
  from ducks, they represent different cuts of meat with different nutritional profiles.
  Duck Breast is a specific cut, while 'Duck' can refer to the whole bird or other
  cuts. Merging them would create confusion and incorrect information about the food
  items.
