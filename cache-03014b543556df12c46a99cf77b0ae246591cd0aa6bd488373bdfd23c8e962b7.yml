text: ' No. In object-oriented programming, it is common practice to use separate
  instance variables for different types of data. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge the ''Cheese'' and ''Name of the cheese'' instances into one instance variable.
  Keeping them as separate instances allows for clearer code organization and easier
  manipulation of each type of data.'
