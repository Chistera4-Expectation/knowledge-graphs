  Although both "rice flour" and "wild rice" contain the word "rice," they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. They refer to different food products with distinct
  properties and uses:


  1. Rice Flour: This is a type of flour made from ground rice (usually white or brown
  rice), used primarily for gluten-free baking or cooking purposes. It has unique
  characteristics compared to wheat flours and other grain flours. Merging it with
  wild rice would create confusion since these two items serve different culinary
  functions.

  2. Wild Rice: Belonging to a completely different genus than regular rice (Oryza
  sativa), wild rice refers to four species within the Zizania genus that grow naturally
  in North American lakes and rivers. With a nutty flavor and higher protein content,
  wild rice serves as an alternative whole grain option rather than a substitute for
  rice flour.


  Therefore, merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates is incorrect because
  they represent separate concepts in terms of their composition, usage, and classification
  within the broader context of grains and flours.'
