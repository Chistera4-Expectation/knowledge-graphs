text: ' "Dessert" would be the most adequate class for "Ice Cream." This is because
  ice cream is typically considered a sweet treat or dessert, and it shares similar
  characteristics with other items in this category. Other examples of desserts include
  cakes, cookies, pastries, and puddings. While some people might enjoy having ice
  cream as a snack or even at breakfast, its primary use case is still as a dessert
  item.'
