text: No, Canola Oil and Macadamia Nut Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties,
  origins, and nutritional profiles. Canola oil is derived from the rapeseed plant,
  while Macadamia Nut Oil comes from the macadamia nut. They differ in terms of taste,
  fatty acid composition, smoke point, and other characteristics. Merging them together
  would not accurately represent their unique features and applications.
