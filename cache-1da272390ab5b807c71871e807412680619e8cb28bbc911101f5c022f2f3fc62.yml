  While cayenne pepper and habanero pepper are both types of peppers and share some
  similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of their taste, heat level,
  appearance, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Maintaining these distinctions is important
  for accurate communication about food and nutrition.'
