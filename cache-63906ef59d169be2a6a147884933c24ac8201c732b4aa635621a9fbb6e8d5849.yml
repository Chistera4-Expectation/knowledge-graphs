text: No, Guinea Fowl Patties and Guinea Fowl Wings should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the Poultry-derived
  Food class and contain Guinea Fowl meat, they are different types of food with distinct
  preparation methods and presentations. Therefore, they should be treated as separate
  instances in the ontology.
