  Although "Italian Dressing" and "Tahini Dressing" may both fall under the category
  of "Food Dressings," they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. Semantically,
  they have different ingredients, flavors, and uses. Ontologically, they belong to
  distinct categories with unique characteristics that make them different dressings.
  Merging these two instances would result in loss of important information about
  each dressing.'
