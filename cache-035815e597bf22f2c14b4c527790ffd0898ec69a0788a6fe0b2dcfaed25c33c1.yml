text: No, Pheasant Tenders and Turkey Tenders should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates because they are derived from different types of poultry
  and may have distinct nutritional profiles, cooking methods, and cultural associations.
  While they share some similarities as being poultry-derived and in the form of tenders,
  they are not identical in every aspect and should be treated as separate instances
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.
