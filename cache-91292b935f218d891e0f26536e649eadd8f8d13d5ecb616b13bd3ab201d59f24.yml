  While both smoked turkey and turkey chili are made from turkey and share some similarities,
  they have distinct differences that make them non-duplicate entities in terms of
  semantics and ontology. Smoked turkey is simply turkey meat that has been cured
  and smoke-cooked, while turkey chili is a dish containing various ingredients such
  as ground turkey, beans, tomatoes, spices, and sometimes vegetables. Therefore,
  these two instances represent different food items with unique preparation methods
  and components.'
