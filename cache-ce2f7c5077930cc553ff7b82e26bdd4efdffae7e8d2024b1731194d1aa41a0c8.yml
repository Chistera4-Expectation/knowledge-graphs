text: No, 'Cornbread' and 'Naan Bread' should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are types of bread, they have distinct ingredients,
  preparation methods, and cultural associations. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the differences between these two types of bread.
