  While both coriander powder and coriander (the fresh leaves of the plant) come from
  the same plant species (Coriandrum sativum), they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they have different culinary uses, flavors, textures, and nutritional
  profiles. Merging them would lead to loss of specificity and could create confusion
  when providing dietary recommendations or meal planning advice.'
