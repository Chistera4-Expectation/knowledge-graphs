  In terms of merging ''Chai Tea'' and ''Mint Tea'' in a Tea class, it depends on
  the specific context and purpose of the classification.


  If the classification is based solely on the type of tea, then ''Chai Tea'' and
  ''Mint Tea'' should not be merged, as they represent different types of tea with
  distinct flavors and ingredients. Chai tea is a blend of black tea, milk, and various
  spices, while mint tea is made from the leaves of the mint plant.


  However, if the classification is based on the shared characteristic of being a
  herbal tea, then ''Chai Tea'' and ''Mint Tea'' could potentially be grouped together,
  as both are non-caffeinated and have unique health benefits.


  In conclusion, the decision to merge or not merge ''Chai Tea'' and ''Mint Tea''
  in the Tea class depends on the specific context and purpose of the classification.'
