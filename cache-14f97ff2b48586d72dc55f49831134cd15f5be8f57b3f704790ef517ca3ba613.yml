text: No, they should not be merged together as they represent different types of
  poultry-derived food products. Duck Broth is a liquid made by boiling duck meat
  and bones, while Duck Tenders are a specific cut of duck meat typically used for
  cooking. These two products have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking,
  so they should be treated as distinct entities.
