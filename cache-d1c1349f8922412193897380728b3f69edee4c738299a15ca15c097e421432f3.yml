text: No, Rice Vinegar and White Vinegar should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both types of vinegar, they have distinct flavor profiles
  and uses in cooking. Rice Vinegar is made from fermented rice and has a milder,
  sweeter taste, while White Vinegar is made from distilled alcohol and has a stronger,
  more acidic flavor. Merging them together would not accurately represent the differences
  between the two and would not provide clear information for users.
