  The attributes ''roast'' and ''strength'' describe different aspects of coffee.
  Roast level refers to how dark or light the beans have been roasted, while strength
  relates to the amount of dissolved solids (such as caffeine, oils, and flavor compounds)
  present in brewed coffee. Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and do not need to be merged.'
