  Grape seeds and mustard seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates, as they
  refer to two distinct types of seeds that come from different plants with unique
  nutritional profiles and uses. Grape seeds primarily contain antioxidants such as
  proanthocyanidins, while mustard seeds are rich in fatty acids, fiber, and minerals
  like calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. Additionally, grape seeds are
  often used for making oil extracts and supplements, whereas mustard seeds have various
  culinary applications including pickling, spice blends, and condiments. Therefore,
  it is important to keep them separate within an edible seed classification system.'
