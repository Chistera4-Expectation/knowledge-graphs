text: No, European-style Butter and Salted Butter should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of butter, they differ in their
  production process and composition. European-style butter typically has a higher
  fat content (around 82-86%) and is made from cultured cream, whereas regular butter
  (like the Salted Butter) has a lower fat content (around 80%) and is made from non-cultured
  cream. Additionally, salted butter contains added salt for flavor, which European-style
  butter does not. These differences make them distinct types of butter.
