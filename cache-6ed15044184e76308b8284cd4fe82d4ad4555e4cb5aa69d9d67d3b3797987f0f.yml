text: No, Canola Oil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct differences in their nutritional profiles, production methods, and uses.
  Canola oil is derived from rapeseed and has a mild flavor, while Extra Virgin Olive
  Oil is made from olives and has a strong flavor. These differences make them unique
  and not duplicates of each other.
