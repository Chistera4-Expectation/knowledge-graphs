  The two types of rice have different textures, flavors, and uses in cooking, making
  them distinct entities that can be differentiated in a systematic way. Arborio rice
  is a short-grain rice with high starch content, which makes it ideal for risottos
  and creamy dishes. Risotto rice, on the other hand, is a specific type of Italian
  rice that is also a short-grain variety but has a slightly different texture and
  taste than Arborio rice. It is more expensive and has a higher quality reputation
  compared to Arborio rice. Therefore, from a culinary perspective, it is not appropriate
  to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
