text: No, the instances 'Slipper Lobster' and 'Squat Lobster' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the
  Edible Crustaceans class, they are distinct species with different appearances,
  habitats, and characteristics. Merging them would not accurately represent the biological
  and culinary differences between these two crustaceans.
