text: As a dietician, I don't specialize in ontologies or semantics. However, I can
  provide information about the two teas. Jasmine Tea and Pu-erh Tea are different
  types of teas with distinct flavors, origins, and production processes. Jasmine
  Tea is made by layering green tea leaves with jasmine flowers, allowing the tea
  to absorb the fragrance and flavor of the flowers. Pu-erh Tea, on the other hand,
  is a post-fermented tea from China, which undergoes a microbial fermentation process.
  Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic or ontologic duplicates.
