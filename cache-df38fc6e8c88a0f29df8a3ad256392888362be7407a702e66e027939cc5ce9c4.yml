text: No, Flaxseed Oil and Soybean Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they both belong to the category of edible vegetable
  oils, they have different properties, nutritional profiles, and uses. Flaxseed Oil
  is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, while Soybean Oil is rich in omega-6 fatty acids.
  Merging them would lose the specificity and valuable information about each oil's
  unique characteristics.
