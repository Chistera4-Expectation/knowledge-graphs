  "Greek Seasoning" is a specific type of seasoning blend that typically includes
  ingredients such as oregano, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt,
  with origins and traditional use in Greek cuisine. It can be considered a single
  instance of a food seasoning.


  On the other hand, "Optional seasonings" refers to any additional seasoning(s) that
  one might choose to add to their dish beyond what has already been included. This
  could encompass an infinite variety of individual herbs, spices, or blends, including
  but not limited to Greek Seasoning. Therefore, optional seasonings cannot be considered
  a duplicate of Greek Seasoning.'
