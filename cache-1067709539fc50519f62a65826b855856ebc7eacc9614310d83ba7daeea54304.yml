  While chili oil and flaxseed oil are both edible vegetable oils, they have different
  nutritional profiles, uses, and sources. Chili oil is made from vegetable oils (such
  as soybean or sesame) that are infused with chili peppers for flavor, while flaxseed
  oil is extracted directly from the seeds of the flax plant. Flaxseed oil contains
  high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and is often used as a health supplement, whereas
  chili oil has a spicy flavor and is primarily used to add taste to dishes. Due to
  these differences, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
