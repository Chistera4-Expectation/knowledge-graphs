text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different food items derived
  from poultry (pheasant). Pheasant Gizzards are a specific cut of meat, while Pheasant
  Gravy is a sauce made using poultry as an ingredient. These two items serve different
  culinary purposes and should be considered distinct.
