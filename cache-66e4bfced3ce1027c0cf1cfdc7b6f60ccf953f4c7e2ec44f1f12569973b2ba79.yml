text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both 'Unsalted Butter' and 'Whipped Butter' are types of butter, they have distinct
  properties and uses. Unsalted Butter is typically used for baking and cooking, whereas
  Whipped Butter is lighter and fluffier, making it ideal for spreading on toast or
  using in recipes where a lighter texture is desired. Merging these two classes would
  obscure these distinctions.
