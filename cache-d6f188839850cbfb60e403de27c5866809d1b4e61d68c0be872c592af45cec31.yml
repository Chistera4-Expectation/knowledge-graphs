  While cantaloupe seeds and quinoa seeds can both be classified under the general
  category of "edible seeds," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  come from different types of plants (cantaloupes vs. quinoa), have different nutritional
  profiles, and are used differently in culinary contexts. Therefore, it is important
  to maintain them as separate instances within the Edible Seeds class.'
