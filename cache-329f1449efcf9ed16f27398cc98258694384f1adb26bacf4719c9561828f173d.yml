text: No, Green beans and Green bell peppers should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetables and share the
  word "green" in their names, they are distinctly different in terms of their botanical
  classification, nutritional profile, and culinary uses. Green beans are legumes
  from the Fabaceae family, while Green bell peppers are fruits from the Solanaceae
  family.
