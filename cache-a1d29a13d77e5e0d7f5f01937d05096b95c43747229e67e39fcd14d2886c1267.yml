text: ' No. Five-spice powder and garlic powder are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They have different ingredients, flavors, uses, and cultural origins. While they
  can both be classified under the broader category of "food seasonings," merging
  them would result in loss of important distinctions between these two distinct spices.'
