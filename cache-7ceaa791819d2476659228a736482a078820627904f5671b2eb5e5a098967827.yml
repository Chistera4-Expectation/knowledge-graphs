  While both Basil Leaves and Fresh Basil Leaves may refer to the same type of vegetable,
  it is important to maintain them as separate instances due to nuances in meaning
  that can affect how they are used and categorized in a knowledge base or information
  system.


  For instance, "Basil Leaves" could potentially include dried basil leaves or ones
  that have been previously frozen, while "Fresh Basil Leaves" would imply that the
  leaves are freshly picked or recently purchased and have not undergone any preservation
  processes. These differences, although subtle, can impact recipe creation, ingredient
  selection, and nutritional value assessments, among other things. Therefore, for
  accuracy and precision, it is best to keep these two terms distinct.'
