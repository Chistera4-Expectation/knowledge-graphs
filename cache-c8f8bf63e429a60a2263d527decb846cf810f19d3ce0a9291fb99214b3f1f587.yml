text: No, Jasmine Rice and Sushi Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have different
  characteristics, uses, and origins. Jasmine Rice is a long-grain rice originating
  from Thailand and is known for its fluffy texture and subtle fragrance. Sushi Rice,
  on the other hand, is a short-grain rice that becomes sticky when cooked and is
  commonly used in Japanese cuisine, particularly in sushi. These differences make
  them distinct types of rice, and they should not be merged as duplicates.
