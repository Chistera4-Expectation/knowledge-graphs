text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are food seasonings, they have different ingredients and flavor profiles, and
  serve different purposes in cooking. Hot sauce typically contains chili peppers
  and vinegar, while soy sauce for seasoning is made from fermented soybeans and wheat.
  The two sauces have distinct tastes and applications in recipes.
