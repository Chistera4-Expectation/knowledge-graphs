text: No, they should not be merged together. Baking powder and onion powder are two
  distinct seasonings with different uses and properties. Baking powder is a leavening
  agent used in baking, while onion powder is a flavoring agent used for seasoning.
  They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
