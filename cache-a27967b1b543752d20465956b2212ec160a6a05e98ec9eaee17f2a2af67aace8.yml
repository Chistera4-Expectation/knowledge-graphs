text: "No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Boiling\
  \ water and oxygenated water serve different purposes and have different properties.\
  \ Boiling water is heated to its boiling point (100\xB0C or 212\xB0F at sea level)\
  \ to kill bacteria and other microorganisms, while oxygenated water is infused with\
  \ oxygen to enhance its properties for various uses, such as promoting metabolism\
  \ or aiding in recovery after exercise. While both are types of water, they have\
  \ distinct differences and should not be merged as duplicates."
