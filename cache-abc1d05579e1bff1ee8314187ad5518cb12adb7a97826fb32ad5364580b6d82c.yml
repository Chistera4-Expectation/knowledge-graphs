  While pork spare ribs and pork tenderloin are both types of pork meat, they have
  different cuts, flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is not
  appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. They serve distinct
  culinary purposes and cater to various gastronomical preferences. Hence, keeping
  these two instances separate would ensure an accurate representation of their unique
  attributes within the Pork-derived Food class.'
