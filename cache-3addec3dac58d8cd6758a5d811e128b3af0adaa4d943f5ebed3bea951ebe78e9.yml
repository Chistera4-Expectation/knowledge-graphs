  While both "Chicken Curry" and "Chicken Wings" are poultry-derived foods that contain
  chicken meat, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates because they differ
  significantly in their preparation methods, ingredients, cultural contexts, nutritional
  profiles, and consumption occasions. Merging them would result in loss of important
  distinctions between these unique dishes.'
