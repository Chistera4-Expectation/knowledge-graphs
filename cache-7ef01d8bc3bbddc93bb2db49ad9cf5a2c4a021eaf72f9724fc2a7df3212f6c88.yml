text: No, "Boneless chicken" and "Chicken Tenders" are not exact semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both derived from chicken and may be similar in some
  aspects, they are different in their specific cut and usage. Boneless chicken typically
  refers to a whole chicken breast or thigh without bones, while chicken tenders are
  a specific cut of chicken, usually taken from the breast, and are often thinner
  and smaller than a boneless chicken breast.
