  Although both Coriander powder and Kashmiri chili powder are ground spices, they
  have different flavors, uses, and appearances. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Coriander powder is made from
  coriander seeds and has a warm, slightly citrusy flavor that works well with various
  dishes like curries, stews, and soups. On the other hand, Kashmiri chili powder
  comes from mild red chilies grown primarily in Kashmir, India; its main characteristic
  is its vibrant red color rather than intense heat, making it suitable for enhancing
  the appearance of dishes without adding too much spiciness.'
