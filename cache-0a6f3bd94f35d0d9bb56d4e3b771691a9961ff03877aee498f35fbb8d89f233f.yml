text: No, 'Chicken Gravy' and 'chicken/vegetable stock' should not be merged together
  as they have different properties and uses in recipes. Chicken gravy is typically
  a thickened sauce made from chicken drippings and used as a condiment, while chicken/vegetable
  stock is a liquid base made from simmering chicken and vegetable ingredients and
  used for cooking soups, stews, and sauces.
