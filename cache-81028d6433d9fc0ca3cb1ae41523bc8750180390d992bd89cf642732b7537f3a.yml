  While both "Maitake mushrooms" and "mushrooms" refer to edible fungi, they are not
  necessarily interchangeable terms. Maitake mushrooms (Grifola frondosa) are a specific
  species of mushroom with unique characteristics, nutritional profile, and culinary
  uses. In contrast, the term "mushrooms" encompasses a broader range of edible fungi
  species, including button mushrooms, portobello mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, oyster
  mushrooms, and many others. Therefore, it is not accurate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
