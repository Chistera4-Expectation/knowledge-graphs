text: ' No. Although both "Calories per serving" and "Carbohydrates per serving" provide
  information about nutrition content, they measure different aspects of it (energy
  versus carbohydrate count). Therefore, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates
  and should remain separate properties for accurate annotation and data modeling.'
