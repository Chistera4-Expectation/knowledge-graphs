text: ' Sure! Here is a basic ingredient list for a Cuban sandwich:


  * Bread (preferably Cuban bread)

  * Ham

  * Roasted pork

  * Swiss cheese

  * Pickles

  * Mustard

  * Mayonnaise (optional)


  Of course, you can always add or substitute other ingredients to suit your taste.
  Some people like to include salami in their Cuban sandwiches, while others prefer
  to keep it simple with just ham and roast pork. It''s up to you!'
