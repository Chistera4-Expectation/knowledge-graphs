  Organic beef and beef back ribs are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They
  refer to different cuts of meat from cattle that have been raised organically. Organic
  beef refers to any cut of meat that comes from an animal that has been raised according
  to specific organic standards, while beef back ribs specifically refer to the rib
  bones and surrounding meat located near the spine of the cow. Therefore, they are
  distinct concepts within the domain of beef products.'
