text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both belong to the Solanaceae
  family and are considered chili peppers, they have distinct differences in taste,
  appearance, and culinary uses. Bell peppers are sweet and mild, while other chili
  peppers can be hot and spicy. These differences make them unique and important to
  distinguish in a dietary context.
