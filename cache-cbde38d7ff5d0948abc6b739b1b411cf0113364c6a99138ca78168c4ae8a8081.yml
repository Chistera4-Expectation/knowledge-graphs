text: As a dietician, I would say that "Breadcrumbs" and "Gluten-Free Bread" should
  not be merged together as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Breadcrumbs
  are small particles of bread that are used as a topping or ingredient, while Gluten-Free
  Bread is a type of bread specifically made without gluten for those with gluten
  intolerance or celiac disease. They serve different purposes and cater to different
  dietary needs.
