text: No, they should not be merged together. Pomegranate seeds and quinoa seeds are
  distinct types of seeds with different nutritional profiles and uses. Pomegranate
  seeds are primarily consumed as a fruit, while quinoa seeds are a popular whole
  grain. Merging them would be incorrect from both a semantic and ontological standpoint.
