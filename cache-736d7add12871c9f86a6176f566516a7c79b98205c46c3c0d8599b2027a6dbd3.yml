  Teff seeds and chia seeds are different types of edible seeds with distinct nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses. Teff seeds are native to Ethiopia and have a higher
  protein content compared to other grains, while chia seeds are known for their high
  fiber and omega-3 fatty acid content. While both can provide a crunchy texture,
  they have different flavors and textures, making them suitable for different applications
  in cooking and baking. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
