text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they are both sausages made
  from poultry, they are made from different types of poultry and may have different
  nutritional profiles, cooking methods, and flavor profiles. Maintaining separate
  instances allows for more accurate and specific information to be provided about
  each type of sausage.
