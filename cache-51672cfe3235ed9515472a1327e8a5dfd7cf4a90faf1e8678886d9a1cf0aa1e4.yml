  While both fresh ginger and dried/ground ginger come from the same plant (Zingiber
  officinale), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different
  physical properties and uses in cooking and medicine. Fresh ginger has a more pungent
  flavor and is often used in raw preparations or added at the end of cooking to retain
  its bite, while ground ginger is milder and typically used in baked goods and spice
  blends. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions for culinary
  and nutritional purposes.'
