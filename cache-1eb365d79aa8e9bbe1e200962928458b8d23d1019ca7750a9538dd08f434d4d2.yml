text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are alcoholic drinks,
  they have different properties, ingredients, and flavors. Red wine is made from
  grapes and has a distinct flavor profile, while coffee-flavored liqueur is made
  with a base spirit and flavored with coffee. They belong to the same class but are
  not duplicates.
