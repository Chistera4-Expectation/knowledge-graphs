  While both "dipping sauce" and "piri piri sauce" may belong to the broader category
  of sauces, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Dipping sauce is a general
  term for any type of sauce used for dipping food into, while piri piri sauce is
  a specific type of hot sauce made with African bird''s eye chili peppers and other
  ingredients. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  together.'
