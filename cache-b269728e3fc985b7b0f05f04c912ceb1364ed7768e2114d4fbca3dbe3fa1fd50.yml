text: ' No, ground pork and pork belly are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They are different cuts of pork with distinct characteristics and uses in cooking.
  Ground pork is made by grinding lean meat from various parts of the pig, while pork
  belly refers to the fatty cut of meat found on the underside of the pig. Therefore,
  they should remain separate instances within the Pork-derived Food class.'
