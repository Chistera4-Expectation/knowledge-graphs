text: ' No. Chopped onions and scallions are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although both are types of edible vegetables, they refer to different specific items
  with distinct flavors, appearances, and uses in cooking. Chopped onions typically
  refer to pieces cut from bulb-forming onion varieties (such as yellow, white, or
  red onions), while scallions, also known as green onions, refer specifically to
  young plants from the Allium family that have long, slender green leaves and small
  white bulbs at their base.'
