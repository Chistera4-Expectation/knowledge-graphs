text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they
  are both gravies derived from poultry, they have different base ingredients (chicken
  vs. guinea fowl), which can affect their flavor, texture, and nutritional content.
  Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
