text: ' Neither coffee nor tea are suitable classes for Vitamin C infusions. Both
  beverages contain small amounts of vitamin C, but they are not used as vehicles
  for delivering large doses of this essential nutrient through an intravenous infusion.
  Therefore, no appropriate class name can be assigned to "Vitamin C Infusion" based
  on the given options.'
