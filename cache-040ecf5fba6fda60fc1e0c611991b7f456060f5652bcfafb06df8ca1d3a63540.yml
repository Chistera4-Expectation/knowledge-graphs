  While both Acacia honey and Eucalyptus honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their source (the type of plant nectar they are made from)
  and therefore may also differ in taste, color, and nutritional content. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. It is
  important to maintain the distinctions between different types of honey to ensure
  accurate labeling and informed consumer choices.'
