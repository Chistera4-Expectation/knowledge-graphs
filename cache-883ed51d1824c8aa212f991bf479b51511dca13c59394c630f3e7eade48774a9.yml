text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food. Quail Nuggets are a specific type of processed poultry product, while Quail
  Stock is a liquid made from simmering quail bones and other parts to extract flavor
  and nutrients. Although both are derived from quail, their forms and uses are different,
  making them distinct entities in the Poultry-derived Food class.
