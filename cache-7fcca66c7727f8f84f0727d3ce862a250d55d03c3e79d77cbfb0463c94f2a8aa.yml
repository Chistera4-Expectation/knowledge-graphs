text: No, they should not be merged. Although both chili oil and olive oil are edible
  vegetable oils, they have different characteristics, ingredients, and uses. Chili
  oil is made from vegetable oils infused with chili peppers, while olive oil is made
  from the fruit of the olive tree. These differences warrant separate instances in
  a class about edible vegetable oils.
