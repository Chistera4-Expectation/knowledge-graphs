  Distilled water and soft water have different processes and characteristics. Distilled
  water is water that has been boiled into vapor and then condensed back into liquid
  in a separate container, leaving most solid contaminants behind. Soft water, on
  the other hand, typically refers to water with low concentrations of dissolved minerals,
  such as calcium and magnesium, that have been treated using a water softener. While
  both types of water may be low in mineral content, they are produced through different
  processes and serve different purposes.
