  While both "chicken pieces" and "fried chicken" are types of poultry-derived food,
  they are not semantic and ontological duplicates. Chicken pieces can refer to any
  cut of chicken meat (e.g., breast, thigh, drumstick), which may or may not be fried.
  On the other hand, fried chicken specifically refers to chicken pieces that have
  been coated in batter or breading and deep-fried until crispy. Therefore, it is
  important to maintain them as separate instances since there are meaningful differences
  between the two.'
