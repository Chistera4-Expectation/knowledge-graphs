text: No, Shaoxing wine and Wine should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of alcoholic drinks, they are distinct in their
  origins, production methods, and cultural significance. Shaoxing wine is a Chinese
  rice wine, while Wine typically refers to alcoholic beverages made from fermented
  grapes. Merging them together would lead to a loss of specificity and accuracy in
  categorization.
