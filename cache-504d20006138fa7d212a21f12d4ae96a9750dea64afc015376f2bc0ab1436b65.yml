text: 'No, they should not be merged. While both are types of yogurt, they have distinct
  characteristics that differentiate them:


  1. Drinkable Yogurt: This type of yogurt is designed to be consumed like a beverage,
  often in a bottle or a similar container. It is typically thinner in consistency
  than traditional yogurt.


  2. Fat-Free Yogurt: This type of yogurt has had the fat content removed or reduced
  to a negligible amount. It is not specifically related to the form or consistency
  of the yogurt.


  Merging these two types of yogurt would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.'
