text: ' No. Fireweed honey and heather honey are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  despite both being types of honey. They come from different flowering plants and
  have distinct flavor profiles, textures, and production methods. Therefore, it is
  important to maintain them as separate instances that provide unique information
  about each type of honey.'
