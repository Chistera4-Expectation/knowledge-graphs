text: 'No, the instances ''Duck Sausage'' and ''Guinea Fowl Sausage'' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates because they are derived
  from different types of poultry: duck and guinea fowl, respectively. Although they
  both fall under the category of sausages made from poultry, they are distinct types
  of sausages with different flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles due to the
  differences in the birds they are made from.'
