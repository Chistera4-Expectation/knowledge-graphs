  The two instances, "Boneless, skinless chicken breasts" and "Chicken," are not identical
  in their entirety. Although they both refer to poultry products, they differ in
  terms of their anatomical origin (breast vs whole bird) and processing level (boned
  and skinned vs unprocessed). From a culinary perspective, these differences can
  result in distinct textures, flavors, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is
  appropriate to keep them separate rather than merging them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
