  While both monk fruit extract and stevia are natural low-calorie sweeteners, they
  come from different sources and have distinct chemical properties. Monk fruit extract
  is extracted from the monk fruit (Siraitia grosvenorii), while stevia is derived
  from the leaves of the Stevia rebaudiana plant. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
