text: ' "Plant-Based Milks" would be the most adequate class for "Other plant-based
  milks such as oat milk," separate from dairy products like Butter, Cheese, Milk
  (dairy), and Yogurt. This classification is based on their shared characteristic
  of being non-dairy alternatives to traditional animal-derived milk.'
