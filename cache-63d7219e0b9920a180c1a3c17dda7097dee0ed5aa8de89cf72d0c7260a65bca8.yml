text: ' No. While both "Calories per serving" and "Trans fat per serving" provide
  information about the nutritional content of cheese, they measure different aspects
  of it and are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Calories refer to the amount
  of energy contained in food, while trans fats are a specific type of fat that can
  have negative health effects when consumed in excess. Therefore, these two pieces
  of information serve distinct purposes and should be treated separately.'
