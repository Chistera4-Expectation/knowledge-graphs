text: No, Corn Oil and Flaxseed Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. They are two distinct types of edible vegetable oils with
  different compositions, nutritional profiles, and uses. While they both fall under
  the category of edible vegetable oils, they have unique properties that make them
  different from each other.
