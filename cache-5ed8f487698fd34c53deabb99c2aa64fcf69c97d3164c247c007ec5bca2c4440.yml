text: No, the instances 'Pork Chop' and 'Pork Tenderloin' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both derived from pork, they
  are distinct cuts of meat with different characteristics, textures, and culinary
  uses. Merging them together would not accurately represent the variety of pork-derived
  foods.
