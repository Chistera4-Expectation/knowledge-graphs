text: No, 'Ceylon Tea' and 'Mint Tea' should not be merged as they are different types
  of tea with distinct flavors and characteristics. Ceylon Tea refers to tea produced
  in Sri Lanka, while Mint Tea is typically a blend of green tea and mint leaves.
  Although they both belong to the broader category of tea, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
