text: No, 'Potatoes' and 'Tomatoes' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both edible vegetables, they are distinct from each other
  in terms of botanical classification, nutritional content, and culinary uses. Potatoes
  belong to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and are classified as tubers, while
  tomatoes are classified as fruits (berries) and also belong to the nightshade family.
  These differences in classification and usage make them separate entities in the
  Edible Vegetable class.
