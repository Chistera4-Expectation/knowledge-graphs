text: ' "Vegetables and Plant-Based Foods" or simply "Vegan-Vegetarian Foods" would
  be an appropriate class name that includes all the given options (Bread, Breakfast
  Cereal, Edible Fruit, Edible Mushrooms, Edible Seaweed, Edible Seeds, Edible Vegetables,
  Edible Vegetable Oils, Pasta Types, Rice) as they are all food items commonly consumed
  in vegetarian diets. However, if you specifically want to focus on the non-animal
  protein sources, then "Edible Vegetarian Proteins" could also work.'
