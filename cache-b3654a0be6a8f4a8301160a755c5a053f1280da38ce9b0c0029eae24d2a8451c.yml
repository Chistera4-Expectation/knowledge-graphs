text: No, Hibiscus Tea and White Tea should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of tea, they are distinct and unique
  in their properties, flavors, and origins. Hibiscus Tea is made from the dried calyces
  of the Hibiscus sabdariffa flower, often has a tart and fruity flavor, and is known
  for its potential health benefits like lowering blood pressure. White Tea, on the
  other hand, is made from the young leaves and buds of the Camellia sinensis plant,
  has a delicate and subtle flavor, and is often praised for its antioxidant properties.
  Merging these two types of tea would not accurately represent their individual characteristics
  and uses.
