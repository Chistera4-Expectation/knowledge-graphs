  The term "fresh" in "Fresh guava slices" implies that the guava slices are recently
  cut and have not undergone any preservation methods, whereas "other fruit slices"
  could refer to sliced fruit that has been dried, canned, frozen, or preserved in
  some other way. These two instances are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  because they describe different states of the fruit.'
