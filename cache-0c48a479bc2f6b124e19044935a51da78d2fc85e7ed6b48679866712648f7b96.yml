text: No, they should not be merged as they have different purposes. 'Optional ingredients'
  refers to additional ingredients that can be added to a recipe to customize it,
  while 'Optional toppings' refers to items that can be added on top of a finished
  dish for additional flavor or texture. Although they may overlap in some cases,
  they are distinct concepts.
