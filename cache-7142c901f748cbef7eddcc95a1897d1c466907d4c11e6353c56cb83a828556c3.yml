  While chili oil and peanut oil may both fall under the category of edible vegetable
  oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different ingredients
  (chili oil is made with chilis while peanut oil is made from peanuts), flavors,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  them as duplicates.'
