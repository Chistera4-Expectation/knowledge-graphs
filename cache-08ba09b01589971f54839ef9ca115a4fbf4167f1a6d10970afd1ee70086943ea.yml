  While both cooked white rice and short-grain rice are types of rice, they have distinct
  characteristics that make them different from each other. Cooked white rice refers
  to any type of rice (including short-grain) that has been processed to remove the
  outer husk, bran layer, and germ, leaving just the starchy endosperm. This results
  in a fluffy, tender grain with little flavor or aroma. On the other hand, short-grain
  rice is a specific variety of rice characterized by its small, plump grains that
  become sticky when cooked due to their high amylopectin content. Short-grain rice
  is often used in dishes like sushi, risotto, and paella. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
