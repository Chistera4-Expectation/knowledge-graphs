text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Quail Drumsticks' and 'Quail Soup' are derived from quails, they are distinct food
  items with different preparation methods, textures, and culinary uses. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the variety within the Poultry-derived Food class.
