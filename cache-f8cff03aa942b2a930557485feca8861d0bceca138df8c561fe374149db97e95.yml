text: No, 'Crab' and 'King Crab' should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although both are crustaceans and crabs, they are different species
  within the Crab family. King Crab, specifically, belongs to the genus Paralithodes
  and is a distinct species with its own unique characteristics. Therefore, they should
  be treated as separate instances in the Edible Crustaceans class.
