text: No, Purified Water and Spring-fed Water should not be merged together as they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. While both are types of drinking water,
  they have different sources and production methods. Purified Water is treated to
  remove impurities, while Spring-fed Water comes from an underground formation from
  which water flows naturally to the surface.
