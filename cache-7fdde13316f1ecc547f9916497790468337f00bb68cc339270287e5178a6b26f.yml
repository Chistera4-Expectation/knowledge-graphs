text: No, the instances 'Turkey Meatballs' and 'Turkey Tenders' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from turkey,
  they are different food preparations with distinct characteristics and uses. Merging
  them would not accurately reflect the differences between these two food items.
