  Buckwheat honey is a type of honey that has a distinct flavor profile and nutritional
  content compared to other types of honey. It is made from the nectar of buckwheat
  flowers and has been found to have higher levels of antioxidants and phenolic compounds
  than other types of honey. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two instances as they represent different products with unique characteristics.'
