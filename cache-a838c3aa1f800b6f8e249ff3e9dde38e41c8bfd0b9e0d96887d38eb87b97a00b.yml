text: ' No. Curry leaves (Murraya koenigii) and bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina)
  are two distinct types of edible vegetable that belong to different plant families
  and have different tastes, appearances, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, they
  should not be merged as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
