text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both Guinea Fowl Tenders and Turkey Tenders are poultry-derived food items,
  they are derived from different types of poultry (Guinea fowl and turkey, respectively),
  and therefore have distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, and textures. Keeping
  them as separate instances allows for more accurate representation of the differences
  between the two in a knowledge base or ontology.
