  While pork belly does contain a significant amount of fat, it is not accurate to
  merge the two as semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer to distinct
  food products with different culinary uses. Pork belly typically refers to a cut
  of meat from the belly of a pig that contains layers of lean meat and fat, which
  can be cooked in various ways (e.g., roasted, braised, grilled) to yield a flavorful
  dish. On the other hand, pork fat specifically refers to the fatty tissue extracted
  from the pig, often used for cooking purposes such as frying or baking, but not
  typically consumed on its own. Therefore, while related, these terms are not interchangeable
  and serve unique functions within their respective contexts.'
