text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct species with different
  characteristics, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Mitten Crab (Eriocheir
  sinensis) and Snow Crab (Chionoecetes opilio) are two different types of edible
  crustaceans, and should be kept as separate instances in the classification.
