text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are types of juice, they are distinct in their ingredients and nutritional content.
  Carrot juice is made from carrots, while orange juice is made from oranges. They
  have different flavors, colors, and nutritional profiles. Merging them would not
  accurately represent the unique characteristics of each juice.
