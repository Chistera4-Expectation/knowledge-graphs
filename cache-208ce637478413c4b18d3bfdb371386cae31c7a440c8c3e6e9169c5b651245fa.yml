  While safflower oil is a type of vegetable oil (as it is derived from plants), not
  all vegetable oils are safflower oil. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They each have distinct properties and uses, so they
  should remain separate entities within the category of edible vegetal oils.'
