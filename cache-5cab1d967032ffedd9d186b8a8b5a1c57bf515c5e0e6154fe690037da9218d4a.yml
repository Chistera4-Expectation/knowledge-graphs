text: No, Clover Honey and Orange Blossom Honey should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the Honey class, they are distinct
  types of honey with different flavors, characteristics, and source plants. Clover
  Honey is made from the nectar of clover flowers, while Orange Blossom Honey is made
  from the nectar of orange tree blossoms. Merging them would disregard the unique
  qualities and differences between the two types of honey.
