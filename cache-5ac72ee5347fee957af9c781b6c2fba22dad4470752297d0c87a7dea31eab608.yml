text: No, Tupelo Honey and Wildflower Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are distinct types of honey with different flavors, textures, and
  nutritional profiles due to the nectar sources of the flowers the bees gather from.
  Tupelo Honey comes from the nectar of Tupelo trees, while Wildflower Honey comes
  from the nectar of various wildflowers. These differences make them unique and should
  be recognized as separate entities.
