text: ' It is difficult to determine the most adequate class for "Cream" based on
  just this information, as all of these foods (butter, cheese, milk, and yogurt)
  contain cream in various forms. However, if we are talking about dairy products
  that consist primarily of cream, then the most appropriate class name would be simply
  "Cream."'
