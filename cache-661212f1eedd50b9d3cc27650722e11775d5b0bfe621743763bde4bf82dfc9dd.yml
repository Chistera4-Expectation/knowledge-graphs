text: No, the instances 'Spreadable Butter' and 'Unsalted Butter' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of butter
  with distinct characteristics and uses. Spreadable butter is designed to be easily
  spreadable at room temperature, while unsalted butter is simply butter without added
  salt. They have different ingredients, nutritional values, and purposes in cooking
  and baking.
