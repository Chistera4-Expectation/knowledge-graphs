text: No, "Duck Sausage" and "Duck Soup" are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although both are derived from duck, they are different food items with distinct
  preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Therefore, they should be treated
  as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
