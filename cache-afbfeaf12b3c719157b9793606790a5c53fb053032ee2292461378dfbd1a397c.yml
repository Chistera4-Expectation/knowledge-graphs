text: No, Strawberry juice and Tomato juice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different types of juices with distinct flavors,
  nutritional profiles, and origins. While they both fall under the broader category
  of "juice," they have unique characteristics that warrant separate instances.
