text: No, the instances 'King Oyster Mushroom' and 'Portobello Mushroom' should not
  be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the Edible
  Mushrooms class, they are distinct species with unique characteristics, appearances,
  and culinary uses. Merging them would obscure these differences and hinder accurate
  classification and information sharing about these mushrooms.
