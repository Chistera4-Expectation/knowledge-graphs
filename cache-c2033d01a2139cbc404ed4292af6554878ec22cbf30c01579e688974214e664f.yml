text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both quail and turkey sausages are derived from poultry, they are distinct food
  items with different nutritional profiles, flavor profiles, and preparation methods.
  Merging them as duplicates would not accurately represent the variety of options
  available in the Poultry-derived Food class.
