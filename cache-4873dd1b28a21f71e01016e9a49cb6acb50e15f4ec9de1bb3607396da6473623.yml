text: No, Hemp Seeds and Sesame Seeds should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of edible seeds, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, properties, and uses. Merging them would result in
  a loss of important information and could lead to confusion.
