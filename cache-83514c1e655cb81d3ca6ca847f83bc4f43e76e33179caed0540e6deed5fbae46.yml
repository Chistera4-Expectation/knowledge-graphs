text: No, Rice noodles and Shirataki noodles should not be merged as they are two
  distinct types of noodles with different ingredients and characteristics. Rice noodles
  are made from rice flour, while Shirataki noodles are made from the konjac yam.
  Although they may share some similarities in texture and usage, they are still different
  types of pasta.
