text: No, Hype Energy and XS Energy should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they may both be energy drinks, they are distinct brands with
  unique ingredients, flavors, and marketing strategies. Merging them would lead to
  a loss of information about each individual brand.
