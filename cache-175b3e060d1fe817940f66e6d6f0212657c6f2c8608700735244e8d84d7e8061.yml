text: No, the instances 'Drinkable Yogurt' and 'Greek Yogurt' should not be merged
  together as they have distinct characteristics and properties. Drinkable Yogurt
  is a liquid form of yogurt, while Greek Yogurt is a thicker, strained yogurt with
  a higher protein content. These differences make them separate entities within the
  Yogurt class.
