text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are types of tea, they have distinct characteristics and flavors. Darjeeling Tea
  is a black tea grown in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal, India, known for
  its floral and muscatel notes. On the other hand, Earl Grey Tea is a black tea infused
  with bergamot oil, giving it a citrusy flavor. Therefore, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
