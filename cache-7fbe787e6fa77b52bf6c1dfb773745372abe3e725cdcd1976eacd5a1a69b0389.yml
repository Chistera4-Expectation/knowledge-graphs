text: As a dietician, I would not give a simple yes or no answer to this question,
  as it depends on the context and purpose of the Sauce class. Merging instances 'Sauce'
  and 'Sriracha sauce' as semantic and ontologic duplicates could be a valid approach
  if the class is designed to be a general representation of sauces, and 'Sriracha
  sauce' is just one example. However, if the class is specifically designed to represent
  different types of sauces, then it would be better to keep them as separate instances,
  as they have distinct characteristics. Ultimately, the decision should be based
  on the intended use and design of the class.
