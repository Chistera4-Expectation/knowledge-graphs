text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of tea, they have
  distinct characteristics and flavors. Darjeeling tea is a black tea from the Darjeeling
  region of India, while ginger tea is a tea infused with ginger, which provides a
  different taste and potential health benefits. Therefore, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
