text: No, Assam Tea and Herbal Tea should not be merged together as they are different
  types of tea. Assam Tea is a black tea from the Assam region of India, while Herbal
  Tea is an infusion of various herbs and spices and does not contain any actual tea
  leaves. Although both are types of beverages that can be considered "tea" in a colloquial
  sense, they have different properties, origins, and compositions, making them distinct
  entities in a semantic and ontological context.
