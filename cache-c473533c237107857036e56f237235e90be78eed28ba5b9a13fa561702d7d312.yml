text: ' No. While shrimp and shrimp-like creatures may share many similarities, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Shrimp is a specific type of crustacean,
  while shrimp-like creatures can refer to any organism that resembles shrimp but
  belongs to a different taxonomic group. Merging them would result in loss of important
  distinctions between different species.'
