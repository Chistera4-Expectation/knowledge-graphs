  Although Arborio rice and Idli rice may both fall under the general category of
  "rice," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different
  properties and uses. Arborio rice is an Italian short-grain rice that is commonly
  used in risotto dishes due to its high starch content, which gives it a creamy consistency
  when cooked. On the other hand, Idli rice is a type of parboiled rice that is typically
  used in South Indian cuisine to make steamed cakes called idlis. The two types of
  rice have distinct nutritional profiles, cooking methods, and cultural significance,
  so they cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
