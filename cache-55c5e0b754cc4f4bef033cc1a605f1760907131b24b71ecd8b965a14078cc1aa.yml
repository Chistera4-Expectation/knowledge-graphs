  Apple seeds and quinoa seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Although
  they both contain the word "seeds," apple seeds come from apples and belong to the
  Rosaceae family, while quinoa seeds come from quinoa plants and belong to the Amaranthaceae
  family. They have different nutritional profiles and uses in food preparation.'
