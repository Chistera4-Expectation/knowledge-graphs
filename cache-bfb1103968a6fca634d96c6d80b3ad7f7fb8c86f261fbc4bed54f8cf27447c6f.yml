text: No, "Pheasant Meatballs" and "Pheasant Tenders" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from poultry, they
  are different types of food preparations. Meatballs are formed by combining ground
  meat with other ingredients, while tenders refer to strips of meat taken from the
  pheasant's breast. The preparation methods, cooking techniques, and nutritional
  values may vary for these two dishes, so they should be treated as separate entities
  in the Poultry-derived Food class.
