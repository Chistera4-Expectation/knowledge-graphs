text: No, Ostrich Eggs and Ostrich Gravy should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from ostriches, they are different
  types of food items. Ostrich Eggs are a type of egg, while Ostrich Gravy is a sauce
  made from ostrich meat. These items belong to different categories and serve different
  purposes in a diet.
