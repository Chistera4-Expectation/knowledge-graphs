text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct properties and uses in culinary
  contexts. Red pepper flakes typically refer to crushed dried red chili peppers and
  are used for their heat and flavor, while Sichuan peppercorns are a type of citrus-scented
  spice with a numbing effect and are used in Sichuan cuisine for a unique flavor
  profile. Although they both fall under the category of spices, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
