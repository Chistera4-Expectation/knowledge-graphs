text: ' "Yogurt" would be the most adequate class for yogurt among the options you
  provided. This is because it specifically refers to the fermented milk product,
  whereas "butter," "cheese," and "milk" refer to different dairy products with distinct
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. By using the class name "Yogurt," you can
  more accurately describe and categorize this food item.'
