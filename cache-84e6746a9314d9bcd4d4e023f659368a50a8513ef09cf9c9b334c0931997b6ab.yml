text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of chili peppers with
  different characteristics and nutritional profiles. Red bell pepper is a mild pepper,
  while other chili peppers can vary in heat levels. Additionally, they may have different
  nutritional values, making them distinct entities in a dietician's perspective.
