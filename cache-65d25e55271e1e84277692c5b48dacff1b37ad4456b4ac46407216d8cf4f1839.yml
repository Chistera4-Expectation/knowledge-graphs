text: "As a dietician, my answer is no. Although \"Additional seasonings\" and \"\
  Italian seasoning\" both fall under the category of food seasonings, they are not\
  \ semantic or ontologic duplicates. \n\n\"Italian seasoning\" refers to a specific\
  \ blend of herbs and spices commonly used in Italian cuisine, typically including\
  \ basil, oregano, thyme, and rosemary. On the other hand, \"Additional seasonings\"\
  \ is a more general term that can encompass a wide variety of herbs, spices, and\
  \ condiments used to enhance the flavor of food, and can include Italian seasoning\
  \ as one of the options.\n\nMerging these two instances would result in a loss of\
  \ specificity and would not accurately represent the distinct differences between\
  \ them. It is essential to maintain the distinction between these two seasonings\
  \ to ensure accurate and meaningful categorization."
