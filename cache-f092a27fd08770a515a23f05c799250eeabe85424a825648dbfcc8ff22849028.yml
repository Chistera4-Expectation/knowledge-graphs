text: ' No. Goat meat and meat are not semantic and ontological duplicates because
  they do not refer to the same thing. While goat meat is a type of meat, it has its
  own specific properties and uses that distinguish it from other types of meat. Therefore,
  it is important to maintain them as separate instances in order to accurately represent
  their distinct characteristics.'
