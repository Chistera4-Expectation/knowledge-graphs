text: As a dietician, I would say that "Flaxseed Milk" and "Hemp Milk" are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. While they both belong to the broader category of plant-based
  milk alternatives, they have distinct nutritional profiles and are derived from
  different plant sources (flaxseeds and hemp seeds, respectively). They may share
  some similarities, but they are not exact duplicates.
