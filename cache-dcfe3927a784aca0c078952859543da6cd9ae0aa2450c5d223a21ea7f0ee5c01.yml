  While both hot peppers and Sichuan peppercorns are used for adding flavor to food,
  they belong to different botanical families and have distinct taste profiles and
  uses in cooking. Hot peppers (Capsicum spp.) contain capsaicin which gives them
  their spicy heat, while Sichuan peppercorns (Zanthoxylum bungeanum) have a unique
  numbing effect on the tongue due to the presence of sanshools. Therefore, it is
  not appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
