text: No, 'Guinea Fowl Broth' and 'Guinea Fowl Wings' should not be merged as they
  are distinct food items. Guinea Fowl Broth is a liquid derived from cooking the
  bird, while Guinea Fowl Wings are a specific part of the bird that can be prepared
  and consumed. Although they both come from the same animal, they have different
  culinary uses and nutritional properties.
