  While diced onion and green onions are both types of onions, they have distinct
  characteristics and uses in cooking. Diced onion typically refers to mature bulb
  onions that have been cut into small cubes, while green onions (also known as scallions)
  refer to young plants with long, thin white bulbs and bright green tops that can
  be used whole or chopped. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge these two terms
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
