text: No, Marinara sauce and Piri Piri sauce should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates because they are distinct types of sauces with different
  ingredients, flavors, and cultural origins. Merging them would result in a loss
  of specificity and potentially confuse users.
