  While both "palm nut soup base" and "palm oil" are related to the same tree species
  (the palm tree), they have different uses and properties. Palm oil is an edible
  vegetable oil derived from the pulp of the fruit of the oil palms, while palm nut
  soup base typically refers to a mixture that includes pureed palm nuts, which contain
  the oil along with other ingredients such as spices and seasonings. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
