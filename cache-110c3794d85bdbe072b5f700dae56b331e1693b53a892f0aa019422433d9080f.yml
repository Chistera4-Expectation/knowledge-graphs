text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of yogurt with
  distinct characteristics. Fruit-Flavored Yogurt refers to a yogurt with added fruit
  flavor, while Low-Fat Yogurt refers to a yogurt with a reduced fat content. These
  two types of yogurt can be made independently or combined in various ways, so they
  are not duplicates.
