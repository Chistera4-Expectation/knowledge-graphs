  While both chicken breasts and chicken pot pie are poultry-derived foods, they have
  different nutritional profiles due to their unique preparation methods. Chicken
  breasts are typically a lean source of protein with minimal fat and calories, while
  chicken pot pie is often higher in fat and calories because it contains added ingredients
  such as butter, cream, and crust. Therefore, merging these two instances would not
  accurately reflect their distinct nutritional properties.'
