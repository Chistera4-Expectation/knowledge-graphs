text: No, Beef shank and beef patties should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both derived from beef, they have different cuts and
  preparation methods, resulting in distinct culinary uses and nutritional profiles.
  Beef shank is a tougher cut of meat that requires slow cooking, while beef patties
  are ground beef formed into patties for grilling or pan-frying.
