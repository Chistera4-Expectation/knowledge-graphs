  While "Creamy Garlic Dressing" and "Poppy Seed Dressing" may have some similarities
  (they are both types of salad dressings), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Semantically, they convey different concepts with unique ingredients and flavors
  - garlic vs poppy seeds. Ontologically, they belong to distinct categories based
  on their composition and usage. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate
  instances for clarity and accuracy.'
