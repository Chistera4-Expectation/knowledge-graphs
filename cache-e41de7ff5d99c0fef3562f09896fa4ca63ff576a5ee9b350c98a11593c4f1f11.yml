  While blue cheese dressing and Italian dressing are both types of food dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients and flavors, making them separate concepts. Blue
  cheese dressing is typically made with blue cheese, mayonnaise, vinegar or lemon
  juice, garlic, and seasonings, while Italian dressing usually contains olive oil,
  red wine vinegar, water, lemon juice, spices (such as oregano, basil, and garlic),
  and sometimes Parmesan cheese. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
