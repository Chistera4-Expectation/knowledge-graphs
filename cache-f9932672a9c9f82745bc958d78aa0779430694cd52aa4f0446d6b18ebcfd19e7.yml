text: As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspects of teas
  but not make decisions on ontology or semantics. However, from a nutritional perspective,
  Chai Tea and Pu-erh Tea have differences in their ingredients and preparation methods,
  so they are not duplicates. Chai Tea is a blend of black tea, spices, and milk or
  cream, while Pu-erh Tea is a fermented tea from China that can be aged for years
  to develop a unique flavor. Both have their unique nutritional benefits and flavor
  profiles.
