text: ' No. Russian dressing and Tahini dressing are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They have distinct ingredients and flavors, with
  Russian dressing typically made from mayonnaise, ketchup, and various seasonings,
  while Tahini dressing is made from sesame seed paste, lemon juice, garlic, and other
  spices. Therefore, they belong to separate categories of food dressings.'
