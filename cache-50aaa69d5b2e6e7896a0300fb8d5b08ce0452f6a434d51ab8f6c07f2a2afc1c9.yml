text: " No.\n\nWhile both avocado oil and safflower oil are types of edible vegetable\
  \ oils, they have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, taste,\
  \ smoke points, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge\
  \ them as semantic and ontological duplicates.\n\nAvocado oil is rich in monounsaturated\
  \ fats, particularly oleic acid, which has been linked to various health benefits\
  \ such as improved heart health and reduced inflammation. It also contains vitamins\
  \ A, D, E, and K, as well as antioxidants like beta-carotene and lutein. Avocado\
  \ oil has a high smoke point (around 520\xB0F) making it suitable for high-heat\
  \ cooking methods like grilling, searing, and roasting. Its mild flavor makes it\
  \ versatile and ideal for salad dressings, drizzling over dishes, or using as a\
  \ substitute for butter or margarine.\n\nOn the other hand, safflower oil is primarily\
  \ composed of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), with linoleic acid being its\
  \ most abundant type. Safflower oil can help reduce bad cholesterol levels and improve\
  \ insulin sensitivity. However, it has a lower smoke point compared to avocado oil\
  \ (around 450-510\xB0F depending on whether it's refined or unrefined). Due to this,\
  \ safflower oil may not be suitable for certain high-temperature cooking techniques\
  \ but works great in low-to-medium heat applications like stir-frying, baking, and\
  \ saut\xE9ing. Additionally, safflower oil has a light, neutral flavor that allows\
  \ it to blend seamlessly into many recipes without altering the original taste profile\
  \ significantly."
