text: No, 'Eggplant' and 'Fried Plantains' should not be merged together as they are
  different types of edible vegetables. Eggplant is a type of fruit (technically a
  berry) from the nightshade family, while fried plantains are a type of starchy fruit
  from the banana family that are typically cooked and served as a side dish or snack.
  Although they are both edible and from the plant kingdom, they have distinct characteristics
  and uses.
