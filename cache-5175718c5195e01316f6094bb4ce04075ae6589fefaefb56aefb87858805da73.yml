  No, the instances ''Kefir Yogurt'' and ''Yogurt'' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct types of fermented dairy
  products with some similarities but also differences in their production process,
  taste, and probiotic cultures. Kefir Yogurt is a type of yogurt that incorporates
  kefir grains, resulting in a unique taste and texture. While they both belong to
  the broader category of yogurt, they have enough differences to warrant separate
  instances in a classification system.'
