text: ' No. Chicken pot pie and grilled chicken are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both belong to the poultry-derived food class. They differ significantly
  in terms of their ingredients, preparation methods, nutritional profiles, and consumption
  contexts, among other factors. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate
  instances for accurate representation and understanding within any knowledge graph
  or database related to food and nutrition.'
