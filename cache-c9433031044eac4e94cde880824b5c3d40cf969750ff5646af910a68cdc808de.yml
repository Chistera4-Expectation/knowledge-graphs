text: ' No. While both fiber and protein are nutrients, they serve different purposes
  in the human body and have different recommended intake levels. Therefore, it is
  important to track them separately rather than merging them together. Fiber helps
  maintain a healthy digestive system, while protein is essential for building and
  repairing tissues. Additionally, from an ontological perspective, fiber and protein
  are distinct concepts with their own properties and relationships, so they should
  not be merged.'
