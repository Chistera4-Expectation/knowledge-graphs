text: No, Acacia Honey and Dandelion Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they both are types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and plant sources, which make them unique and not duplicates.
  Merging them would result in a loss of valuable information and accuracy in classification.
