  While both "rice paper wrappers" and "sushi rice" are related to food preparation
  involving rice, they serve different purposes and functions in cooking. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Rice paper wrappers are thin sheets made from rice flour that are commonly used
  for rolling up fillings in Vietnamese cuisine, such as summer rolls. They do not
  contain any actual cooked rice grains like sushi rice does.


  On the other hand, sushi rice is short-grain Japanese rice that has been seasoned
  with vinegar, sugar, and salt, and is often used as the base for various types of
  sushi dishes. It has a sticky texture that helps hold the sushi ingredients together.


  Therefore, while they may share some similarities in their use of rice, they have
  distinct differences in their culinary applications and usage.'
