  The instance ''Calories per teaspoon'' refers to the amount of energy present in
  a given quantity (teaspoon) of a particular food item or substance. It is a measurable
  value that varies depending on the type of sweetener being considered.


  On the other hand, ''Monk fruit extract, another natural low-calorie sweetener''
  describes a specific kind of natural low-calorie sweetener derived from monk fruits.
  This information pertains more to its origin, composition, and properties rather
  than an exact caloric measurement like ''Calories per teaspoon.'' Therefore, these
  two instances are not semantically or ontologically equivalent and do not need to
  be merged.'
