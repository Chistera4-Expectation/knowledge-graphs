  While both "chicken pot pie" and "fried chicken" are poultry-derived foods containing
  chicken, they have distinct ingredients, preparations, and nutritional profiles.
  Merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates would not accurately represent
  their unique culinary identities. Chicken pot pie typically consists of diced or
  shredded chicken, vegetables, and gravy inside a pastry crust, while fried chicken
  is made by coating chicken pieces in seasoned flour before deep-frying them.'
