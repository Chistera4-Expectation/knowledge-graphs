  While both "chicken tacos" and "grilled chicken" contain poultry meat, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates because they represent different dishes with
  unique ingredients and preparation methods. Chicken tacos usually include tortillas,
  salsa, vegetables, and seasonings, whereas grilled chicken is typically prepared
  by itself without additional components. Merging them would result in loss of information
  about their distinct culinary identities.'
