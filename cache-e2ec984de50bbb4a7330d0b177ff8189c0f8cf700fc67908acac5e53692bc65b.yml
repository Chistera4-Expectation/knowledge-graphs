text: No, they should not be merged together. While they both involve duck, they are
  different types of food items with distinct nutritional properties and culinary
  uses. Duck broth is a liquid made by simmering duck bones, meat, and vegetables,
  while 'Duck' typically refers to the meat from the duck. These differences make
  them separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
