  While both "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Chicken Nuggets" are poultry-derived foods,
  they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they have
  different ingredients, preparation methods, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses.
  A Chicken Caesar Salad typically includes romaine lettuce, croutons, parmesan cheese,
  dressing, and grilled chicken; it is often served as a light meal or appetizer.
  In contrast, Chicken Nuggets are usually made from ground chicken meat mixed with
  various binders and seasonings, then breaded and deep-fried; they are commonly consumed
  as finger food or part of fast-food meals. Therefore, these two items serve distinct
  purposes and cater to varying dietary preferences and needs.'
