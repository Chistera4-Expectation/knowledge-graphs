text: No, "Pheasant Nuggets" and "Pheasant Wings" should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from poultry, they are
  different products with distinct preparation methods and possibly nutritional values.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived food
  options available.
