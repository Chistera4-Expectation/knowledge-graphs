  While both "dipping sauce" and "tomato sauce" can be categorized under the broader
  term of "sauces," they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates because they
  refer to distinct types of sauces with different uses and ingredients. Dipping sauces
  typically refer to thicker, flavorful condiments that are used for dipping foods
  like chicken fingers, fries, or egg rolls. Tomato sauce, on the other hand, is a
  specific type of thin sauce made primarily from tomatoes, often used in Italian
  cuisine for dishes such as pasta or pizza.'
