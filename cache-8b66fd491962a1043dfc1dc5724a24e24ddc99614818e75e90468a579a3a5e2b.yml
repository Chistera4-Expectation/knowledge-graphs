  While both fresh basil leaves and fresh parsley are types of herbs that can be used
  in similar ways (such as garnishing or adding flavor to dishes), they have distinct
  tastes, appearances, textures, nutritional profiles, and cultural uses. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. It is
  essential to maintain their unique identities within the Edible Vegetable class
  for proper categorization and understanding of these ingredients.'
