text: No, 'Pheasant Broth' and 'Pheasant Gizzards' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from poultry, specifically
  pheasant, they are different types of food. Pheasant Broth is a liquid dish made
  by boiling pheasant meat and bones, while Pheasant Gizzards are a specific organ
  meat of the pheasant. They are distinct food items and should be treated as such
  in a dietary classification system.
