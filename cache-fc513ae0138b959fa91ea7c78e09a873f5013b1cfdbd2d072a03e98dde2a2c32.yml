  While both "Honey" and "Raspberry Honey" are types of honey, they cannot be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates because they have different defining properties.
  "Honey" is a general term for a sweet substance produced by bees from the nectar
  of flowers, while "Raspberry Honey" specifically refers to honey made primarily
  from the nectar of raspberries. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between
  them based on their unique characteristics and uses.'
