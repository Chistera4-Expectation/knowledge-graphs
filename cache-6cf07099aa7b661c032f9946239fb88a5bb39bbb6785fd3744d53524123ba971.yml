text: ' No. While both stockfish and dry fish are types of preserved fish, they undergo
  different preservation methods: stockfish is unsalted and dried by cold air, while
  dry fish can be preserved through various means including salt curing, smoking,
  or sun drying. Therefore, they have distinct nutritional profiles and gastronomical
  uses, making them non-duplicate entities within the Edible Fish class from both
  semantic and ontological perspectives.'
