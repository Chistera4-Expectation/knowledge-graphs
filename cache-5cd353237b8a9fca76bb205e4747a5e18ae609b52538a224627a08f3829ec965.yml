text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are poultry-derived foods, they are different types of food with distinct properties
  and preparations. "Pheasant Meatballs" are a specific dish made from ground pheasant
  meat, while "Quail Meat" refers to the meat of quail birds, which can be used in
  various dishes or consumed on its own.
