text: No, the instances 'Crab' and 'Mitten Crab' should not be merged together as
  they are separate species within the Edible Crustaceans class. While they both belong
  to the same class, they are distinct species with unique characteristics and should
  be treated as separate entities in a semantic and ontologic context.
