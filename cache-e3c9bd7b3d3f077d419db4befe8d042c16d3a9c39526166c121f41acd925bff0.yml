text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both 'Ground Pork' and 'Pork Schnitzel' are derived from pork, they are different
  pork-based food items with distinct culinary preparations and appearances. Ground
  pork is a minced or ground form of pork, while pork schnitzel is a breaded and fried
  pork cutlet. They have different nutritional values and cooking methods, so they
  should not be considered as the same entity.
