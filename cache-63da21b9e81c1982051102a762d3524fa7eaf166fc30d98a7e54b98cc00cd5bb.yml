  The terms "fresh mozzarella" and "mozzarella" refer to different types of cheese
  with distinct characteristics, even though they share some similarities. Fresh mozzarella
  is a type of mozzarella that has not been aged or dried, whereas regular mozzarella
  may have undergone aging or drying processes. These differences in production methods
  result in variations in taste, texture, and nutritional content. Therefore, it is
  appropriate to keep them separate rather than merging them as duplicates.'
