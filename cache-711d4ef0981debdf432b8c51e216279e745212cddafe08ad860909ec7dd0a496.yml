  The two instances, "Lactose-free milk" and "Sheep''s milk," are not duplicate entries.
  They refer to different types of milk with distinct characteristics and nutritional
  profiles. Lactose-free milk is cow''s milk that has had its lactose removed, whereas
  sheep''s milk is derived from sheep and has a unique fatty acid profile compared
  to other types of milk. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
