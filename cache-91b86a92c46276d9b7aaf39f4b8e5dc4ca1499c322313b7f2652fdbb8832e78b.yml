text: No, these two instances should not be merged together. While both are types
  of beef, they have different properties and uses in cooking. "Beef cubed steak"
  is a cut of beef that has been tenderized by mechanical means, while "Corned beef
  brisket" is a cured and brined beef brisket. These differences in preparation and
  culinary use make them distinct entities.
