text: No, they should not be merged together. While both pickled mustard greens and
  pickles involve preserving vegetables through pickling, they are distinct types
  of food. Pickled mustard greens specifically refer to preserved mustard greens,
  while pickles can refer to a variety of pickled vegetables, such as cucumbers, carrots,
  and onions. Merging them together would lead to confusion and incorrect classification
  of the specific types of pickled vegetables.
