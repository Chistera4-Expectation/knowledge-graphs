  duplicates. They are different types of edible vegetable oils with distinct properties,
  nutritional profiles, and uses. Pistachio Oil is derived from pistachio nuts, while
  Safflower Oil comes from the seeds of the safflower plant. They have different fatty
  acid compositions, flavors, and applications in cooking and food preparation.
