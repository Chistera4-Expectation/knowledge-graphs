text: No, Manuka Honey and Raspberry Honey should not be merged together as they are
  different types of honey with distinct properties and flavors. Manuka Honey is a
  specific type of honey produced in New Zealand and Australia, known for its unique
  antibacterial properties, while Raspberry Honey is made from the nectar of raspberry
  flowers. Although they are both types of honey, they have different characteristics
  that make them unique and valuable in their own right.
