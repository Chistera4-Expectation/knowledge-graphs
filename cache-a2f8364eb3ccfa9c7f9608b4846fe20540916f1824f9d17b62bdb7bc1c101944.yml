text: No, Clover Honey and Manuka Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they both belong to the Honey class, they have different properties
  and characteristics. Clover Honey is produced by bees that feed on clover blossoms,
  while Manuka Honey is produced by bees that feed on the nectar of the manuka tree,
  which is native to New Zealand. These differences in their production and source
  result in distinct flavors and nutritional profiles.
