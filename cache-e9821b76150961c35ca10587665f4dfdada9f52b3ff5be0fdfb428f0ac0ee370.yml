text: No, they should not be merged. 'Soy sauce for seasoning' is a specific type
  of seasoning, while 'seasoning' is a broader term that includes various types of
  flavor enhancers, such as herbs, spices, and sauces like soy sauce. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the distinction between general seasoning and a specific
  type of seasoning.
