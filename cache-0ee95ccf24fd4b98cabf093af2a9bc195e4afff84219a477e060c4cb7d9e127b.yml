text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of milk, they
  have distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. Coconut milk is a plant-based
  milk alternative, while milk typically refers to dairy milk from animals like cows.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between these types
  of milk.
