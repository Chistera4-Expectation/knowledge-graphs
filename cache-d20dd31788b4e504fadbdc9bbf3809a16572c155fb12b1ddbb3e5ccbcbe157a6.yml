  While both Greek yogurt dressing and Italian dressing can be categories of salad
  dressings, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different
  ingredients, flavors, and textures, and represent distinct culinary traditions (Greek
  vs. Italian). Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions and confuse
  users.'
