  While both Blackberry Honey and Organic Clover Honey fall under the category of
  honey, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct
  characteristics that set them apart. Blackberry Honey is made from the nectar of
  blackberry flowers and has a unique flavor profile, while Organic Clover Honey is
  made from clover plants and also has its own distinctive taste. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two types of honey as duplicates.'
