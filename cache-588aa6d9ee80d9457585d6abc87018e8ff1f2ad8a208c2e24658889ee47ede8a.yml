text: No, Black Rice and Glutinous Rice should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of rice with different characteristics. Black Rice is a type of rice
  with a deep black or purple color, often used for its high nutritional value and
  antioxidant properties. Glutinous Rice, also known as sticky rice, has a high starch
  content and is used in various Asian cuisines for its unique texture. Although they
  may be both considered as types of rice, they have different properties and uses,
  and therefore should not be considered as semantic or ontologic duplicates.
