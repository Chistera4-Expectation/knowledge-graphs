text: As a dietician, my answer is no. While both 'Hoisin sauce' and 'Sauce' are related,
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Hoisin sauce' is a specific type
  of sauce, whereas 'Sauce' is a broader category that includes various types of sauces,
  such as hoisin sauce, tomato sauce, soy sauce, etc. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the hierarchy and relationships between different types of sauces.
