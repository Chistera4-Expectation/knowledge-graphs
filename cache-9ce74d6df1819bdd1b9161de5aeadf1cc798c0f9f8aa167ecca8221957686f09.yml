  While both "thinly sliced meat" and "turkey slices" refer to types of poultry-derived
  food that have been sliced thinly, they are not necessarily semantic nor ontological
  duplicates. Thinly sliced meat can refer to any type of meat that has been sliced
  thinly, including beef, chicken, lamb, etc., whereas turkey slices specifically
  refer to thinly sliced pieces of turkey meat. Therefore, it is important to maintain
  these distinctions when categorizing different types of foods.'
