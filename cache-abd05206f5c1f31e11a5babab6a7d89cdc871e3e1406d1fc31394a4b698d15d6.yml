text: As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspects of pork
  chops and pork cutlets, but the decision to merge or not merge instances in a Pork-derived
  Food class would be determined by the specific context and purpose of the classification
  system being used. In general, pork chops and pork cutlets are distinct cuts of
  meat, with different shapes and cooking methods, so they would not be considered
  exact duplicates in terms of culinary use. However, they do share the same primary
  ingredient (pork) and can be similar in nutritional content. Ultimately, the decision
  to merge or not merge these instances would depend on the specific needs and goals
  of the classification system being used.
