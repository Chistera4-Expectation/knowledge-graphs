  While red pepper flakes and habanero peppers are both types of peppers, they have
  different characteristics and uses in cooking. Red pepper flakes typically consist
  of dried and crushed red chili peppers and are used to add heat and flavor to dishes.
  On the other hand, habanero peppers are fresh or dried fruits of the Capsicum chinense
  plant that are known for their fruity, slightly sweet flavor with intense heat.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
