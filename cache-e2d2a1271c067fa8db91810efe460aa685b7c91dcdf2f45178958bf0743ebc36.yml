  While peanut oil is an edible vegetable oil that is extracted from peanuts (also
  known as groundnuts), palm nut soup base is not an edible vegetable oil but rather
  a type of cooking ingredient made by blending together various components including
  palm nuts, water, and sometimes other ingredients like spices or seasonings. Therefore,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.'
