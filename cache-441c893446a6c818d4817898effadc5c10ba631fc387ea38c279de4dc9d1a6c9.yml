  While both chili oil and palm oil are types of oils used in cooking, they have different
  compositions and uses. Chili oil is typically made from vegetable oil that has been
  infused with chili peppers, while palm oil is extracted directly from the fruit
  of the oil palms. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
