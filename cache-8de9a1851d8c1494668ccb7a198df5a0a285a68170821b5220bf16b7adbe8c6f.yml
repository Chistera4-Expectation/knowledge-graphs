  While blue cheese dressing and sesame ginger dressing may both fall under the category
  of "food dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they
  have distinct ingredients, flavors, textures, and uses. Blue cheese dressing is
  typically made with blue cheese, mayo, sour cream, vinegar or lemon juice, garlic,
  salt, and pepper, while sesame ginger dressing usually consists of soy sauce, rice
  vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, sugar, and sometimes garlic. They serve different culinary
  purposes and appeal to varying taste preferences. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as duplicates.'
