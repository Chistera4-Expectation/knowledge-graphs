  While fenugreek seeds and sunflower seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and health benefits. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. Maintaining
  separate entries for each type of seed allows for more accurate and detailed information
  about their unique characteristics and applications.'
