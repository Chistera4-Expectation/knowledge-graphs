text: "Sure, here's an example of an instances list for a class Sweetener with concise\
  \ names:\n\n```python\nclass Sweetener:\n\n    def __init__(self, name, sweetness,\
  \ calorie_per_gram):\n        self.name = name\n        self.sweetness = sweetness\n\
  \        self.calorie_per_gram = calorie_per_gram\n\nsweetener_instances = [\n \
  \   Sweetener(\"Honey\", 8, 64),\n    Sweetener(\"Maple Syrup\", 6, 60),\n    Sweetener(\"\
  Brown Sugar\", 5, 36),\n    Sweetener(\"Powdered Sugar\", 4, 30),\n    Sweetener(\"\
  White Sugar\", 3, 40)\n]\n```\n\nThis code defines a class called Sweetener with\
  \ three attributes: name, sweetness, and calorie_per_gram. It then creates an instances\
  \ list called sweetener_instances with five instances of the Sweetener class. Each\
  \ instance has a unique name, sweetness, and calorie_per_gram value.\n\nThis code\
  \ is concise and easy to read. It uses a single class definition and a single instances\
  \ list to store all the information about the sweeteners. The names of the sweeteners\
  \ are short and descriptive. The code is also modular, which makes it easy to add\
  \ new sweeteners to the list."
