text: No, Assam Tea and Mint Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although both are types of tea, they are distinct in their flavor profiles and origins.
  Assam Tea is a black tea from the Assam region of India, while Mint Tea is a herbal
  tea flavored with mint leaves. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences
  between the two types of tea.
