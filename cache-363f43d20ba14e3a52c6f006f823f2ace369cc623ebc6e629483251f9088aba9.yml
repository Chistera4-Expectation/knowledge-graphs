text: No, Kiwi Seeds and Papaya Seeds should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are seeds from edible fruits, they belong to
  different plant species and have different nutritional profiles and uses. They should
  be treated as separate entities within the Edible Seeds class.
