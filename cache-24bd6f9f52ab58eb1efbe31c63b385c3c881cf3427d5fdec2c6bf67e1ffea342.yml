text: No, the instances 'Pita Bread' and 'Soda Bread' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of bread, they
  have distinct characteristics, ingredients, and preparation methods. Merging them
  together would not accurately represent the differences between these two types
  of bread.
