  Stevia is one type of sweetener, but it has unique characteristics that distinguish
  it from other types of sweeteners. Therefore, Stevia and Sweeteners cannot be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates. It would be more appropriate to consider Stevia
  as a subclass of Sweeteners, rather than merging them together.'
