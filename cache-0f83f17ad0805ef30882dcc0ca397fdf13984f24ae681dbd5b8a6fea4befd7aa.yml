text: As a dietician, my answer is no. While Chinese cabbage and Napa cabbage are
  closely related, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Chinese cabbage
  is a broader term that includes different varieties, including Napa cabbage, which
  is a specific type of Chinese cabbage. Therefore, they should not be merged together
  as they are distinct but related types of vegetables.
