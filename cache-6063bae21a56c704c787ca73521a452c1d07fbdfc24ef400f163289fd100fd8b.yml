  While both Portobello mushrooms and sliced Shiitake mushrooms are types of edible
  mushrooms, they have different characteristics and uses in cooking. Portobello mushrooms
  are larger and meatier than Shiitake mushrooms, with a more earthy flavor and a
  firmer texture that makes them suitable for grilling or stuffing. Sliced Shiitake
  mushrooms, on the other hand, are thinner and more delicate, with a rich, smoky
  flavor that is often used in stir-fries and soups. They can be used interchangeably
  to some extent, but they are not identical and their differences make them better
  suited for different dishes. Therefore, it would not be accurate to merge them as
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
