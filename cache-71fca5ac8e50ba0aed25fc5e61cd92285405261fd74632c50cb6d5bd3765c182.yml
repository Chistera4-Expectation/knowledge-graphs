text: No, the instances 'Velvet Pioppini Mushroom' and 'White Button Mushroom' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both
  types of edible mushrooms, they have distinct characteristics, appearances, and
  nutritional profiles. Merging them together would not accurately represent the differences
  between the two mushrooms.
