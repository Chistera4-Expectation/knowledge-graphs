  Blackberry honey and creamed honey are not semantic nor ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of honey. Blackberry honey is a varietal honey made primarily
  from the nectar of blackberry flowers, while creamed honey (also known as whipped
  honey) is any type of honey that has been processed to control crystallization,
  resulting in a smooth, spreadable texture. Therefore, they represent distinct concepts
  within the domain of honey and should not be merged together.'
