text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. While both Alfredo sauce and Mole sauce
  are types of sauces, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. They have different
  ingredients, flavors, and cultural origins. Merging them together would not accurately
  represent their unique characteristics and uses in culinary contexts.
