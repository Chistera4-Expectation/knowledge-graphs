  While avocado oil and canola oil may share some similarities as edible vegetable
  oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come from different
  plant sources (avocados vs. rapeseed), have distinct nutritional profiles, and their
  uses in cooking might vary due to differences in smoke points, flavors, and other
  properties. Therefore, it is essential to maintain separate categories for these
  two types of oils.'
