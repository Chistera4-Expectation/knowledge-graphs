text: No, "Bluefish" and "Redfish" should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are two distinct species of fish with different characteristics,
  appearances, and culinary uses. Bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) and Redfish (also
  known as Red Drum, Sciaenops ocellatus) are different species and should be treated
  separately in a classification system.
