  While both Blueberry Honey and Raw Wildflower Honey fall under the general category
  of honey, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct
  characteristics that set them apart. Blueberry Honey is made from the nectar of
  blueberry flowers, which gives it a unique flavor profile and color. On the other
  hand, Raw Wildflower Honey is unprocessed honey collected from various wildflowers,
  resulting in a diverse taste and composition depending on the floral sources. Therefore,
  these two types of honey possess different properties and deserve separate designations.'
