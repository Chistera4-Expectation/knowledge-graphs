text: No, Parboiled Rice and Sticky Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have distinct processing
  methods and characteristics. Parboiled Rice is partially boiled in the husk, resulting
  in a firmer texture and faster cooking time, while Sticky Rice, also known as glutinous
  rice, is a type of rice that has a high starch content, making it sticky when cooked.
