text: ' No. Catfish fillets and fresh raw fish are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though catfish is a type of fish. They have different physical properties,
  preparation methods, nutritional values, and uses in recipes. Therefore, they should
  remain separate instances within the Edible Fish class.'
