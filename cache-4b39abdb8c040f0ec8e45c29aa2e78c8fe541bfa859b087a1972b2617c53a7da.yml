text: ' No. While both lobsters and squat lobsters are crustaceans that are often
  eaten, they belong to different taxonomic families (Nephropidae for true lobsters
  and Galatheidae for squat lobsters) and have distinct physical characteristics,
  behaviors, and habitats. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
