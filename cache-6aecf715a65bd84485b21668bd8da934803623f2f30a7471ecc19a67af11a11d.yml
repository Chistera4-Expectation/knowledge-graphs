  While both Chicken Pot Pie and Rotisserie Chicken are poultry-derived foods, they
  have different preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is not
  appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Chicken Pot Pie typically consists of diced or shredded cooked chicken, mixed with
  vegetables (such as peas, carrots, and celery) in a creamy sauce, all enclosed in
  a pastry crust and baked until golden brown. It can vary in calorie content depending
  on factors such as the type of crust used and portion size, but generally has higher
  calories compared to rotisserie chicken due to the added fats from the crust and
  sauce.


  On the other hand, Rotisserie Chicken is simply a whole chicken that has been seasoned
  and slow-cooked on a spit, resulting in tender, juicy meat. This cooking method
  allows for minimal added fat during preparation, making rotisserie chicken a leaner
  protein source than chicken pot pie. The caloric content depends primarily on the
  weight of the bird, with an average roasted chicken providing around 165 calories
  per 3 oz serving without skin.


  Given these differences, it would not be accurate to consider "Chicken Pot Pie"
  and "Rotisserie Chicken" as semantic and ontological duplicates in this context.'
