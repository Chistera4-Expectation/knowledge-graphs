text: No, the instances 'Swiss cheese' and 'crumbled feta cheese' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of cheese, they
  have distinct characteristics, flavors, and textures that make them unique from
  each other. Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of cheeses available.
