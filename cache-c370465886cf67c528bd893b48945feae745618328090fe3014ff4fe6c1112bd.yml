  While peanut oil and sunflower oil may both fall under the category of edible vegetable
  oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come from different
  plants (peanuts vs. sunflowers) and have distinct nutritional profiles, flavors,
  and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
