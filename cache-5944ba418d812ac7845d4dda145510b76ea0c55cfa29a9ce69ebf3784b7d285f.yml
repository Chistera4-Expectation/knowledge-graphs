  While blackberry honey and fireweed honey are both types of honey, they come from
  different floral sources (blackberries vs. fireweed) and have distinct flavor profiles,
  nutritional content, and other properties. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates. They should be treated as separate
  categories within the "honey" class due to their unique characteristics.'
