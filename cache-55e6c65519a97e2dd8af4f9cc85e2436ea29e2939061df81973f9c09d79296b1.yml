text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both involve vegetables, they
  serve different purposes and have distinct properties. Vegetable oil is a type of
  fat used for cooking, while vegetable stock is a liquid used as a base for soups
  and other dishes. They are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
