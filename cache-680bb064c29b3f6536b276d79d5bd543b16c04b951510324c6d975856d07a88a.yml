  While "cinnamon" can refer to both the bark of the Cinnamomum tree and its ground
  form, they are not identical in terms of their physical properties and uses. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to distinguish between them as separate instances in a food seasoning
  class. This allows for more accurate and specific information about each type of
  cinnamon.'
