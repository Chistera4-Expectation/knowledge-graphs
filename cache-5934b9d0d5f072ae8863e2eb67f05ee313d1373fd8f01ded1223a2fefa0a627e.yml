text: No, the instances 'Ground Pork' and 'Pork' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of pork-derived food,
  with 'Ground Pork' being ground meat from pigs, and 'Pork' referring to the meat
  in general. They have distinct properties and uses in recipes.
