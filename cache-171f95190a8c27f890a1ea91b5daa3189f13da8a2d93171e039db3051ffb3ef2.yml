text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Alkaline
  water and distilled water are distinct types of drinking water with different properties
  and production methods. Alkaline water typically has a higher pH level, while distilled
  water is purified by boiling and condensing the steam, removing most impurities.
  These differences justify their separate classifications.
