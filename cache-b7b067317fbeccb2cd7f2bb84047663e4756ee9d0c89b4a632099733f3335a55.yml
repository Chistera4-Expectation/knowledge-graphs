  While both refer to sauces, they represent different concepts and serve distinct
  purposes within the context of a recipe or menu. "The base ingredient of the sauce"
  refers to the primary component that forms the foundation of a particular sauce,
  while "Optional dipping sauce" is an additional condiment served alongside a dish
  for added flavor, if desired. Merging these two would not accurately reflect their
  unique roles and meanings.'
