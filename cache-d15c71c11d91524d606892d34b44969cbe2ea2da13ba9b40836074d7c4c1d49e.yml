  While both "Calories per serving" and "Sugar per serving" provide information about
  the nutritional content of cheese, they measure different aspects of it and are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates. Calories refer to the amount of energy obtained
  from consuming food, while sugar specifically refers to simple carbohydrates that
  can affect blood glucose levels. Therefore, it is important to keep these two attributes
  separate for accurate nutrition tracking and analysis.'
