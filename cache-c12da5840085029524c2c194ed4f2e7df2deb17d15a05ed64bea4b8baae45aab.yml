  Breadcrumbs and bread for serving have different meanings and uses, so they should
  not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Breadcrumbs refer to small pieces of bread that are used as a trail or navigation
  aid, typically on a website, to help users understand their location within the
  site hierarchy. They do not necessarily involve actual bread, but rather represent
  a digital metaphor using the concept of physical breadcrumbs.


  On the other hand, "bread for serving" refers to actual edible bread served alongside
  food dishes, often during meals. It is meant for consumption by people, unlike breadcrumbs
  which serve an informational purpose. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge these two concepts as they belong to distinct categories with unique applications.'
