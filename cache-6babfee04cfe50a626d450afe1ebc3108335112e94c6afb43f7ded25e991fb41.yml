text: No, Glacier Water and Spring Water should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they both refer to types of drinking water, they are sourced differently.
  Glacier Water comes from melting glaciers, while Spring Water comes from natural
  underground springs. This difference in source can impact the mineral content, taste,
  and purity of the water. Therefore, they should be treated as distinct instances
  in the Drinking Water class.
