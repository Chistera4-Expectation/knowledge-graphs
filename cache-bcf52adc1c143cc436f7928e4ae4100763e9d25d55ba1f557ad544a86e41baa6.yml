text: As a dietician, I can provide insights into the culinary and nutritional aspects
  of these spices. From a nutritional standpoint, cumin powder and ground cumin are
  essentially the same thing, as they both contain the same spice in a ground form.
  However, from a semantic and ontologic perspective, they might not necessarily be
  considered duplicates, as 'Cumin powder' and 'Ground cumin' could potentially be
  different products produced by different brands or have slight variations in their
  processing methods or purity. Therefore, my answer is no, they should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates without further information about the specific
  products in question.
