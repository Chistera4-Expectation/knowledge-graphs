  Naan bread and Panko breadcrumbs are two different types of bread products with
  distinct textures, tastes, and uses in cooking. Naan bread is a leavened flatbread
  popular in Indian cuisine, while Panko breadcrumbs are Japanese-style crumbs made
  from crustless white bread. They have different nutritional profiles and serve different
  purposes in recipes. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
