text: ' "Seafood" would be the most appropriate class for fish, as it is a category
  that includes various types of marine life consumed as food. This category allows
  for clear differentiation from other types of meat such as beef, pork and poultry.
  Fish offers numerous health benefits including being high in protein, low in saturated
  fat, and rich in omega-3 fatty acids making it an excellent choice for those looking
  to maintain a healthy diet.'
