text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of poultry-derived
  foods. Pheasant meatballs are a specific dish made from ground pheasant meat, while
  pheasant stock is a liquid broth made by simmering pheasant bones and meat. These
  items have distinct properties and uses, so they should be treated as separate entities
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.
