  the listed items, considering its primary component, chilli peppers, are rich in
  vitamins C and A, antioxidants, and fiber. However, the selection could be further
  narrowed down to more specific foods that are derived from red chilli powder:

  which are rich in capsaicin, a spice with health benefits.

  - **Edible Vegetable:** Red chilli powder can be made from dried or powdered red
  chilli peppers, which are a good source of vitamin C and fiber.

  - **Food Seasoning:** Red chilli powder is a common seasoning used in many Indian
  dishes and contains a variety of spices, including cumin, coriander, turmeric, and
  ginger.


  Therefore, the most adequate class for Red Chilli Powder among the listed items
  would be either **Edible Seeds**, **Edible Vegetable**, or **Food Seasoning**, depending
  on the specific components used in the powder.'
