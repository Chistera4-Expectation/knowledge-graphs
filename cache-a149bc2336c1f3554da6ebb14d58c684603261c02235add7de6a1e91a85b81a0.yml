text: ' No. While cantaloupe seeds and watermelon seeds are both types of edible seeds,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they come from different
  types of fruits and have their own distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it
  is important to distinguish between them when discussing edible seeds.'
