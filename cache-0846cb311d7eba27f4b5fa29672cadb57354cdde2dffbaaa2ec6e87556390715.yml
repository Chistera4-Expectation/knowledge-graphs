text: No, Enoki mushrooms and White Button mushrooms should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both edible mushrooms, they have distinct
  characteristics, appearances, and uses in cooking. They belong to different species
  and should be treated as separate entities in a classification system.
