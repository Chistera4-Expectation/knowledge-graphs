text: ' Simply ''Drink'' would be the most appropriate classification for soda. This
  is because soda doesn''t fit into any of the more specific categories like ''Alcoholic
  Drink,'' ''Coffee,'' ''Drinking Water,'' ''Energy Drink,'' ''Infusion Drink,'' ''Juice,''
  ''Milk,'' or ''Tea.'' It contains carbonated water, sweeteners, and flavorings,
  but no alcohol or caffeine, so it isn''t an energy drink or alcoholic beverage either.'
