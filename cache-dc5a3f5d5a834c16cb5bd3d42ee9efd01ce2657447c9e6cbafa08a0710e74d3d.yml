text: No, they should not be merged as they are different parts of the ostrich and
  have different nutritional profiles. Ostrich gizzards are a muscle found in the
  digestive system of the ostrich, while ostrich tenders are a cut of meat from the
  breast or upper leg of the ostrich. Both have unique characteristics and uses in
  cooking, so they should be considered separate entities in the Poultry-derived Food
  class.
