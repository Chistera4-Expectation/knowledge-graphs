  While pork chops and pork spareribs are both derived from pigs and can be classified
  under the broader category of "pork," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They have different cuts, flavors, textures, and cooking methods, making them distinct
  food items that require separate categorization. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances.'
