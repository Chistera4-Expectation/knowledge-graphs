text: ' Sparkling water is most closely related to the category of "Carbonated Beverages".
  However, if we have to choose one from your list, it would be closest to an "Energy
  Drink", as both contain added elements (carbonation in sparkling water and caffeine
  in energy drinks) that make them different from plain drinking water. But keep in
  mind this comparison isn''t perfect due to their distinct characteristics.'
