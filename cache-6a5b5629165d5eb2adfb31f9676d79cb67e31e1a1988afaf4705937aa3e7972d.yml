  While avocado oil and corn oil can both be classified under the broader category
  of edible vegetable oils, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They
  have distinct chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, extraction methods, uses,
  flavors, and origins. Avocado oil is richer in monounsaturated fats (mainly oleic
  acid) compared to corn oil, which has more polyunsaturated fatty acids (primarily
  linoleic acid). Merging them as duplicates would disregard their unique characteristics
  and potential health benefits.'
