text: ' No. Coconut oil and safflower oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of edible vegetable oils. They have different nutritional
  profiles, chemical structures, culinary uses, and sources. Therefore, it is important
  to maintain them as separate entries with distinct information.'
