  Coconut water and Herbal Infused Water are two different types of drinks with distinct
  nutritional profiles and uses. While they may be similar in some ways, such as being
  refreshing and hydrating, they differ in their composition, health benefits, and
  cultural associations. Therefore, they should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates.'
