text: No, 'Pork Cutlet' and 'Pork Tenderloin' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are different cuts of pork with distinct characteristics
  and cooking methods. Pork cutlet is typically a thin, boneless slice of meat, often
  breaded and fried, while pork tenderloin is a lean, long, and narrow cut of meat
  that can be grilled, roasted, or pan-seared.
