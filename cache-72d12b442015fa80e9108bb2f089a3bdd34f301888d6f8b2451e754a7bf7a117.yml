text: As a dietician, my answer is no. Although both instances refer to a type of
  dressing, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. 'Dressing' is a general
  term for a sauce or condiment used to flavor or enhance the appearance of food,
  while 'Thousand Island dressing' is a specific type of dressing with a particular
  recipe and flavor profile. Merging them together would not accurately represent
  the differences between various types of dressings.
