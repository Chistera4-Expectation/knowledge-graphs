  While chili peppers and white peppers may share some similarities, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates and should not be merged together. They belong
  to different species of plants, with chili peppers coming from Capsicum annuum and
  white peppers being made by removing the outer skin of black peppers (Piper nigrum).
  As such, they have distinct flavors, appearances, and uses in cooking.'
