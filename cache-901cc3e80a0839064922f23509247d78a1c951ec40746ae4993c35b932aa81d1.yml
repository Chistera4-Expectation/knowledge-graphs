  While both grapeseed oil and safflower oil are types of vegetable oils that are
  often used in cooking, they have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses. Grapeseed oil is high in polyunsaturated fats, particularly
  vitamin E, and has a mild flavor that makes it suitable for salad dressings and
  drizzling over finished dishes. Safflower oil, on the other hand, contains primarily
  monounsaturated fats and has a higher smoke point than grapeseed oil, making it
  ideal for high-heat cooking methods such as stir-frying and deep-frying. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
