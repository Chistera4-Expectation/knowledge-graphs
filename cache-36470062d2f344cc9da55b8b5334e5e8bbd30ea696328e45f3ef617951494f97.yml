text: "As a dietician, I can provide a perspective based on the nutritional content\
  \ and properties of these two types of butter. However, the decision to merge them\
  \ or not would ultimately depend on the context and purpose of the classification\
  \ system. \n\nLactose-free butter and spreadable butter have different properties.\
  \ Lactose-free butter is made for those who are lactose intolerant, and it has lactase\
  \ enzyme added to break down lactose. Spreadable butter, on the other hand, is designed\
  \ to be easily spreadable at room temperature, often achieved by blending it with\
  \ other ingredients like vegetable oil.\n\nFrom a nutritional standpoint, they can\
  \ be considered similar in terms of fat content and calories. However, if the classification\
  \ is based on functional properties or dietary restrictions, they may not be considered\
  \ duplicates.\n\nIn conclusion, based on nutritional content, they can be considered\
  \ similar, but if the classification is based on functional properties or dietary\
  \ restrictions, they should not be merged as duplicates."
