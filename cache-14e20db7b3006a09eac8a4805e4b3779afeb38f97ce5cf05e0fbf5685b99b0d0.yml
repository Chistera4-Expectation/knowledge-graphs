text: No, Dungeness Crab and Stone Crab should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are crustaceans, they belong to different
  species and have distinct characteristics, such as habitat, appearance, and culinary
  uses. Merging them would lead to loss of specific information and incorrect categorization.
