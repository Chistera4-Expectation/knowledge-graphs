  While both "grass-fed beef" and "beef back ribs" refer to types of beef, they are
  not semantic nor ontological duplicates. Grass-fed beef is a term used to describe
  how cattle were raised (on grass), while beef back ribs are a specific cut from
  a cow. They belong to different categories within the hierarchy of beef products.'
