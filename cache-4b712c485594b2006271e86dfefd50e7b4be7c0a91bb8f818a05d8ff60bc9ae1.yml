text: No, "Duck Gizzards" and "Quail Gizzards" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both gizzards from poultry, they come
  from different bird species and may have slightly different nutritional profiles
  and preparation methods. Thus, they should be treated as distinct instances within
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
