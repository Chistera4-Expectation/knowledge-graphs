text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both 'Crab' and 'Sand Crab' are edible crustaceans, they are different species and
  should be treated as distinct instances in a classification system. 'Crab' is a
  more general term that encompasses various species, while 'Sand Crab' is a specific
  species, also known as Emerita Analoga.
