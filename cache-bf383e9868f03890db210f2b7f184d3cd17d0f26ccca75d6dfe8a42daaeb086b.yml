text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of beef. "Beef"
  is a general term for meat from cattle, while "Corned beef brisket" is a specific
  cut of beef that has been cured with salt and other seasonings. Although they are
  related, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
