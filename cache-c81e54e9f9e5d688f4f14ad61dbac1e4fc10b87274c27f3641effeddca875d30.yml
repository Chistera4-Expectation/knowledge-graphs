  Grain-finished beef and ground beef are not semantic nor ontological duplicates,
  although they refer to different aspects of beef production and consumption. Grain-finished
  beef is a term used for cattle that have been fed grain-based feeds during the finishing
  phase of their growth, which impacts the flavor, texture, and marbling of the meat.
  In contrast, ground beef refers to any raw beef product made by grinding lean finely
  chopped meat from one or more cuts or trim. Therefore, these two terms represent
  distinct concepts within the domain of beef production and do not serve as duplicate
  labels.'
