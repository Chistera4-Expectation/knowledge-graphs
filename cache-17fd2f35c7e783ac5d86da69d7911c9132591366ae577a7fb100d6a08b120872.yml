text: No, Rain Water and Tap Water should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both types of drinking water, they have different
  characteristics and sources. Rain Water is naturally occurring, while Tap Water
  is treated and distributed by water utilities. They may have similar uses, but they
  are not the same thing.
