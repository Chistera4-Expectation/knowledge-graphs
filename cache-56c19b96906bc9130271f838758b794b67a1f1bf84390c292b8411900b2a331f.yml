  While avocado dressing and creamy garlic dressing may share some similarities (e.g.,
  both are typically used to add flavor to salads), they have distinct ingredients
  and characteristics that make them unique. Avocado dressing is usually made with
  mashed avocados, oil, vinegar or lemon juice, and seasonings like salt, pepper,
  and sometimes garlic. On the other hand, creamy garlic dressing often contains dairy
  products such as sour cream or yogurt, along with garlic, herbs, and spices for
  added flavor. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  as semantic and ontological duplicates since they represent different food items.'
