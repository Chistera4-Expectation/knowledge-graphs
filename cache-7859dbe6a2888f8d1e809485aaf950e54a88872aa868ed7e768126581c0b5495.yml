text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food. Ostrich Broth is a liquid food made from simmering ostrich meat or bones,
  while Ostrich Gizzards are a specific part of the ostrich's digestive system that
  is typically consumed as a meat product. Although they both come from ostriches,
  they are different in terms of their form and usage in cooking.
