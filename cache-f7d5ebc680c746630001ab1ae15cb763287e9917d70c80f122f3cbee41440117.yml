  While both dipping sauces and toppings can serve similar functions (i.e., adding
  flavor to food), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer
  to different culinary concepts with distinct uses. Dipping sauces typically involve
  foods that are meant to be dipped into them before consumption, such as chicken
  wings, fries, or egg rolls. On the other hand, toppings are ingredients placed on
  top of a dish for added texture and flavor after it has been cooked, like shredded
  cheese on chili or sliced bananas on pancakes. Merging these two concepts would
  oversimplify their unique roles in cooking and meal preparation.'
