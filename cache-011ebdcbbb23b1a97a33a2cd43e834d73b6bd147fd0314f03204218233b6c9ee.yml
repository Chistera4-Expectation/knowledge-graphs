text: No, 'Black Rice' and 'Short-grain Rice' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they are both types of rice, they have distinct characteristics,
  nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking. Black Rice, also known as Forbidden Rice,
  is high in antioxidants and has a nutty flavor, while Short-grain Rice is typically
  stickier and used in dishes like sushi and risotto. Merging them would not accurately
  represent their unique properties.
