text: No, Vegetable Broth and Vegetable Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different types of edible vegetable products
  with distinct properties, uses, and nutritional values. Vegetable Broth is a liquid
  made by simmering vegetables in water, while Vegetable Oil is a fat extracted from
  vegetables and used for cooking or other purposes.
