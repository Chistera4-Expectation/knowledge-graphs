text: No, the instances 'Hermit Crab' and 'Sand Crab' should not be merged as they
  are distinct species with different characteristics, habitats, and nutritional profiles.
  Hermit crabs are decapod crustaceans, while sand crabs are omnivorous crustaceans.
  Merging them would result in a loss of specific information and potentially lead
  to confusion or misinformation.
