text: No, Russian dressing and Thousand Island dressing should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they share some similarities, such as being creamy
  dressings with a combination of mayonnaise, ketchup or chili sauce, and pickle relish,
  they have distinct differences in ingredients and flavor profiles. Russian dressing
  typically includes horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, and paprika, while Thousand
  Island dressing includes sweet pickle relish, onion, and often includes a touch
  of sugar. These differences in ingredients and flavor make them separate dressings
  with unique identities.
