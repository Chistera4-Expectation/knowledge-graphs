text: No, Enoki Mushroom and Reishi Mushroom should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they are both edible mushrooms, they have distinct
  characteristics, nutritional profiles, and uses in culinary and medicinal applications.
  Merging them together would result in a loss of important information and distinctions
  between the two.
