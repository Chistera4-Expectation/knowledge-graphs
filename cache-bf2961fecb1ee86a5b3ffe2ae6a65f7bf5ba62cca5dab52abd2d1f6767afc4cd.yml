text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of edible mushrooms
  with different characteristics, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Portobello
  mushrooms are large, brown, and have a meaty texture, while Velvet Pioppini mushrooms
  are small, velvety, and have a more delicate flavor. Merging them would result in
  a loss of specific information and categorization.
