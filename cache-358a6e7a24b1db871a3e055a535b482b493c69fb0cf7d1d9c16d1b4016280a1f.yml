  While both ''Beef'' and ''beef back ribs'' are types of beef, they refer to distinct
  cuts and have different nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is not appropriate to
  merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Keeping these terms separate
  allows for more accurate tracking and comparison of their individual nutritional
  values.'
