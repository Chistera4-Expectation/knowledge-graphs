text: As a dietician, I would say no, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both instances are related to tomatoes, they represent different
  forms or presentations of the vegetable. 'Tomato slices' implies that the tomato
  is sliced, which can affect its nutritional value and texture. 'Tomato' is a more
  general term that can refer to the whole fruit or other forms of the vegetable.
  In a food database or dietary context, it is useful to differentiate between these
  forms.
