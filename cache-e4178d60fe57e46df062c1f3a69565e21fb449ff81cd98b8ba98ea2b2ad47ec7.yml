text: ' No. While "Chicken curry" is a specific dish that includes chicken as an ingredient,
  it cannot be considered a duplicate of "chicken." Chicken refers to the meat from
  a domesticated bird of the genus Gallus gallus domesticus, while chicken curry is
  a prepared food made with chicken and various spices. Therefore, these two concepts
  have distinct meanings and serve different purposes in a knowledge graph about poultry-derived
  foods.'
