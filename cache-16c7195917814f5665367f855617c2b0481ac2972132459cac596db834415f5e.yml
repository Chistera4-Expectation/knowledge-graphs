  While both chili oil and rice bran oil are types of edible oils, they have different
  characteristics and uses, so they should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Chili oil is typically made by infusing vegetable oil with chili peppers
  and has a spicy flavor, while rice bran oil is extracted from the germ and inner
  husk of rice grains and is known for its mild flavor and high smoke point. Therefore,
  they belong to distinct categories within the broader classification of edible oils.'
