text: As a dietician, my answer is no, they should not be merged. 'Grapefruit juice'
  and 'Juice' are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Grapefruit juice' is a specific
  type of juice made from grapefruits, while 'Juice' is a more general term that can
  refer to any fruit juice. Merging them would result in a loss of information and
  specificity.
