text: ' The most adequate class for Thai basil is "Food Seasoning." Thai basil, also
  known as Asian basil or holy basil, is an herb commonly used in Southeast Asian
  cuisine to add flavor and aroma to various dishes. It belongs to the food seasoning
  category due to its use as a seasoning agent rather than being a main ingredient
  in any of the classes mentioned above.'
