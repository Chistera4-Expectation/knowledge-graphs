text: No, coconut oil and extra virgin olive oil should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  chemical compositions, nutritional properties, and culinary uses. Coconut oil is
  high in saturated fats and has a high smoke point, while extra virgin olive oil
  is high in monounsaturated fats and has a lower smoke point, making them different
  in terms of health benefits and cooking applications.
