text: No, Cornbread and White Bread should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they both fall under the category of bread, they have distinct
  ingredients, nutritional profiles, and cultural associations, making them unique
  entities. Merging them would lead to loss of specific information and context.
