text: ' No. Canola oil and Vegetable oil are not exact synonyms, and they have different
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. While they share some similarities, they
  are distinct edible vegetable oils with their own unique characteristics. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
