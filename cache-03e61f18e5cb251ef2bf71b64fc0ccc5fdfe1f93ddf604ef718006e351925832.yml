text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Ostrich Meatballs" and "Ostrich
  Patties" are derived from ostrich meat and belong to the Poultry-derived Food class,
  they are different dishes with distinct preparation methods and possibly different
  nutritional profiles. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within
  the class.
