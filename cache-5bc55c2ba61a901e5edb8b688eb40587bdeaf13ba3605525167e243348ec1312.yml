text: No, Five-spice powder and Onion Powder should not be merged together as they
  are distinct seasonings with different compositions and uses in cooking. Five-spice
  powder typically contains a mix of five spices (such as star anise, cloves, cinnamon,
  Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds), while Onion Powder is made from dehydrated onions
  and used as a seasoning to add onion flavor to dishes.
