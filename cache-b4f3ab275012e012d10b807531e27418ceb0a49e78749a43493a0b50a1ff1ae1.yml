  Although black-eyed peas and snow peas are both types of edible vegetables, they
  belong to different species and possess unique nutritional profiles. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. Black-eyed
  peas (Vigna unguiculata) are legumes with a higher protein content, while snow peas
  (Pisum sativum var. saccharatum) are actually considered pod peas, richer in vitamin
  C and fiber compared to black-eyed peas.'
