text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food items. Pheasant Broth refers to a liquid dish made from pheasant meat and bones,
  while Pheasant Nuggets are a solid, bite-sized dish made from pheasant meat. Although
  they both come from the same bird, they serve different culinary purposes and have
  distinct properties.
