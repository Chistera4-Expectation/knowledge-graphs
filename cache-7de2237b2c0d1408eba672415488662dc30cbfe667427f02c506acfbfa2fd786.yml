  While Maggi seasoning cubes and Old Bay seasoning may both fall under the category
  of food seasonings, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different
  ingredients, flavors, uses, and brand associations. Merging them would result in
  loss of important distinctions between these two distinct seasoning products.'
