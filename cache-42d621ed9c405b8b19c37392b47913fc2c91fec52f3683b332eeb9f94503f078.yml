  While both "Maggi seasoning cubes" and "optional seasonings" may serve similar functions
  (i.e., adding flavor to food), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Maggi seasoning cubes refer to a specific brand of seasoning product with a pre-determined
  set of ingredients and flavors. On the other hand, optional seasonings can include
  any type of seasoning that is added at the discretion of the cook, which could encompass
  a wide range of spices, herbs, sauces, etc. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two concepts as identical entities within a Food Seasoning class.'
