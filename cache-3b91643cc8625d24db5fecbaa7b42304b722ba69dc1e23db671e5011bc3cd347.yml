  While "cooked white rice" and "long grain white rice" are related, they do not mean
  the same thing and cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates. Cooked
  white rice refers to any type of white rice that has been cooked, while long grain
  white rice is a specific variety of white rice characterized by its long grains.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
