text: No, Coconut Milk and Hemp Milk should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both considered milk alternatives, they
  have distinct nutritional profiles, tastes, and sources. Merging them would lead
  to a loss of specific information about each type of milk.
