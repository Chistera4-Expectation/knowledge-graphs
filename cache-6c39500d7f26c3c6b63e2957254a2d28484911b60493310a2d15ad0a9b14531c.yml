  While both "chicken curry" and "low-sodium chicken broth" are poultry-derived foods,
  they do not represent semantic and ontological dupicates. They differ significantly
  in their ingredients, preparation methods, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking.
  Merging them would lead to confusion and loss of important information regarding
  these distinct food items.'
