text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from poultry,
  specifically chicken, they are distinctly different cuts of meat with different
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Boneless chicken refers to chicken without
  bones, typically breast or thigh meat, while chicken gizzards are a specific organ
  meat with different nutritional values.
