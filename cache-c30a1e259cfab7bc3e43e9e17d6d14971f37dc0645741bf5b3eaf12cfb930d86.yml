text: No, Brown Rice and Forbidden Rice (also known as Black Rice) are not semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have distinct
  characteristics, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Therefore, they should
  not be merged together as instances in the Rice class.
