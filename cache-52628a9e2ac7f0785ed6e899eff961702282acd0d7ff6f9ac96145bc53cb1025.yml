text: No, Pheasant Eggs and Pheasant Soup should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from pheasants, they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional profiles and culinary applications. Pheasant
  Eggs are a source of protein and other nutrients, while Pheasant Soup is a prepared
  dish that may include various ingredients and cooking methods. They should be treated
  as separate entities in the Poultry-derived Food class.
