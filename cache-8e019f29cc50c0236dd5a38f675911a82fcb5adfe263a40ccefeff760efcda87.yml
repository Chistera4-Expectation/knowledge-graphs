text: No, Black Rice and Japonica Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are distinct varieties of rice with different properties,
  appearances, and uses. Black Rice is known for its dark color and high nutritional
  value, while Japonica Rice is a short-grain variety commonly used in Japanese and
  Korean cuisine. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between
  these types of rice.
