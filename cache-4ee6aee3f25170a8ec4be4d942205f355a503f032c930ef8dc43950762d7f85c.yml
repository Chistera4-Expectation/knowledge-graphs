  While both cantaloupe seeds and poppy seeds come from plants and can be classified
  under "edible seeds," they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They differ
  in their nutritional content, taste, texture, culinary uses, and sources. Merging
  them would result in loss of important distinctions between these two types of edible
  seeds.'
