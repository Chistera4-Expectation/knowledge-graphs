  Although Adobo seasoning and Jamaican Jerk Seasoning may have some ingredients in
  common, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they represent distinct
  cultural blends with unique combinations of spices and flavors that give each their
  own distinctive taste and purpose in cooking. Adobo seasoning is typically associated
  with Filipino cuisine and has ingredients like garlic powder, onion powder, oregano,
  turmeric, and bay leaves, while Jamaican Jerk Seasoning features allspice, Scotch
  bonnet peppers, nutmeg, cinnamon, and thyme, which gives it a completely different
  flavor profile. Therefore, these two seasonings should not be merged as duplicates.'
