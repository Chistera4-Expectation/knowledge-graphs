text: ' The most adequate class for infused waters would be "Beverages" or specifically,
  "Non-Alcoholic Beverages". Infused waters are not Alcoholic Drinks, Coffee, Edible
  Vegetable Oils, Energy Drinks, Honey (though sometimes honey is used as an ingredient),
  Milk, or Tea. They fall under the category of flavored water or enhanced water drinks.'
