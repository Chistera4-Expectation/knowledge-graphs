text: ' No. Rice vinegar and sherry vinegar have different tastes, ingredients, and
  uses in cooking. Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged. Rice vinegar is made from fermented rice and has a milder
  flavor compared to sherry vinegar which is made from aged sherry wine and has a
  more robust and complex taste.'
