text: 'As a dietician, I can provide some insight into the nutritional aspects of
  Greek and Turkish coffee. While they are similar in preparation and ingredients,
  there may be slight variations in the brewing process and the amount of sugar added.
  However, from a purely dietary perspective, they can be considered similar in their
  nutritional content.


  From a programming and ontology standpoint, the decision to merge the instances
  ''Greek Coffee'' and ''Turkish Coffee'' would depend on the specific requirements
  of the Coffee class and the broader context of the program. If the focus is strictly
  on nutritional content and the brewing process is not a significant factor, merging
  the instances could be a valid option. However, if the program requires distinguishing
  between the two types of coffee for other purposes, such as cultural or regional
  aspects, it may be more appropriate to keep them separate. Ultimately, the decision
  should be based on the specific needs of the program and its users.'
