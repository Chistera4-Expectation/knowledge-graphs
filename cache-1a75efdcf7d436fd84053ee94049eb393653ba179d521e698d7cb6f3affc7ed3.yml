text: ' "Spice" or "Fruit & Vegetable" could be appropriate classes for antioxidants,
  as certain spices (such as cinnamon and turmeric) contain high levels of antioxidants,
  and fruits and vegetables are also well-known sources. However, it is important
  to note that not all spices or plant-based foods necessarily contain antioxidants,
  so the context in which this classification is being used would need to be considered.
  Additionally, there are other food groups beyond those listed that can provide antioxidants,
  such as whole grains and nuts.'
