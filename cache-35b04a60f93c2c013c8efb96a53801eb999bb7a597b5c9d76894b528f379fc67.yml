text: ' Yes. In general, "cooked white rice" and "white rice" can be considered semantic
  and ontological duplicates since they refer to the same thing: rice that has been
  processed to remove its husk, bran, and germ, leaving only the starchy endosperm,
  which is then cooked. However, it is important to note that there may be slight
  variations depending on cultural contexts or specific preparation methods (e.g.,
  some people might use "white rice" to refer specifically to uncooked grains), so
  caution should be exercised when merging these terms in certain situations.'
