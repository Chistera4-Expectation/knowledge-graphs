text: ' No. Although ice water and water are closely related (with ice water being
  simply water that has been cooled to the freezing point and had ice crystals formed),
  they have different physical and sensory properties which can affect hydration and
  nutrition. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate instances for
  accuracy and specificity in a dietary context.'
