  While canola oil and olive oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they have
  different nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses, so they cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates. Canola oil is high in monounsaturated fats,
  has a neutral flavor, and is often used for cooking at high temperatures due to
  its stability. Olive oil, on the other hand, contains mostly monounsaturated fat
  (specifically oleic acid), has a distinctive taste, and is commonly associated with
  Mediterranean cuisine. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate categories
  for these two distinct types of oils.'
