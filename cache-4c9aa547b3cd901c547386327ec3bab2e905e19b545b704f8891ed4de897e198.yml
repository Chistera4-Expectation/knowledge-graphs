text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they are both types of bell peppers, they can be distinguished by their color
  and possibly taste. Bell peppers can be green, red, yellow, orange, or even purple,
  and each color may have slight variations in flavor and nutritional content. Therefore,
  it's essential to keep them as separate instances in the Edible Vegetable class.
