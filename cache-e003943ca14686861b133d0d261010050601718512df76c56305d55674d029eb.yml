text: No, the instances 'Hedgehog Mushroom' and 'Shiitake Mushroom' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, appearances, and culinary
  uses. Hedgehog mushrooms (Hydnum repandum) have a spiny underside and a mild, nutty
  flavor, while shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes) have a brown cap, a meaty texture,
  and a rich, savory taste. These differences make them unique and separate within
  the Edible Mushrooms class.
