text: ' No. Calories per serving and Protein per serving provide distinct and separate
  information about a cheese product. While they both relate to nutritional content,
  they measure different aspects of it: calories represent the energy provided by
  the food, while protein is a specific macronutrient that plays various roles in
  the body. Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates and serve unique
  purposes for individuals monitoring their nutrition intake.'
