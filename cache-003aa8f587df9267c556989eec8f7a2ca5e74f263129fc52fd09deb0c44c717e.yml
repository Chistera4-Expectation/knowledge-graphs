  Cooked rice and rice flour are not semantic and ontological duplicates, despite
  both being derived from rice. They have different nutritional profiles, culinary
  uses, and preparation methods:


  1. Nutritional profile: Cooked rice is higher in water content compared to rice
  flour. Additionally, cooked rice provides more carbohydrates, proteins, fiber, and
  some micronutrients like B vitamins per serving than rice flour due to its intact
  bran layer (in whole grain varieties). On the other hand, rice flour has lower moisture
  content but contains more starch since it''s made by grinding milled rice grains
  into a fine powder. Therefore, they cater differently to various dietary needs and
  goals.

  2. Culinary uses: Cooked rice serves as a primary source of carbs for many dishes
  worldwide, including stir-fries, soups, pilafs, casseroles, sushi rolls, and desserts.
  It can also function as a side dish on its own. Meanwhile, rice flour plays an essential
  role in gluten-free baking and cooking, thickening sauces, making breadings, dumpling
  wrappers, crepes, and pasta. Both forms serve unique purposes within their respective
  categories.

  3. Preparation methods: To prepare cooked rice, you need to cook raw rice kernels
  with water until softened; this process takes about 15-40 minutes depending on the
  variety and method used (boiling, steaming, absorption, etc.). In contrast, preparing
  rice flour involves dry grinding or wet milling of dehulled rice grains. These distinct
  processing techniques result in dissimilar textures, flavors, and applications for
  each product.'
