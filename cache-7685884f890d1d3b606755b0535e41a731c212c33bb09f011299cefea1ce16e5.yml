text: No, Lion's Mane Mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) and Maitake Mushroom (Grifola
  frondosa) should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  they are both edible mushrooms, they belong to different genera and have different
  properties and uses in cuisine and medicine.
