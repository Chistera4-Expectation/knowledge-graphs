  From a semantic perspective, "long grain white rice" is a more specific type of
  "long-grain rice." Both terms refer to varieties of rice that have long grains,
  but "long grain white rice" has been further processed to remove the bran and germ
  layers, resulting in its characteristic white color. Therefore, it would make sense
  to merge them as they are related concepts with some overlap.


  From an ontological perspective, merging these two instances would help eliminate
  redundancy and improve data consistency by ensuring that all references to long-grain
  rice use a single term. This could simplify queries, reporting, and analysis involving
  this concept.'
