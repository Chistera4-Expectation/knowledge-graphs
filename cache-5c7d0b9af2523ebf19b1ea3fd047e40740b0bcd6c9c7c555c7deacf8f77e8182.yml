text: No, the instances 'Goat meat' and 'Guinea Fowl Meat' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from animals and
  classified as meats, they come from different animal sources (goat and guinea fowl)
  and have distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Therefore, they should
  be considered as separate entities within the Poultry-derived Food class.
