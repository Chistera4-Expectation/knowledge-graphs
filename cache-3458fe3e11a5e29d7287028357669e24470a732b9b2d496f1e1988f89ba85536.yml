  While both canola oil and chili oil are types of edible vegetable oils, they have
  different physical properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Canola oil is derived
  from rapeseed plants and has a neutral flavor, making it suitable for various cooking
  applications such as frying, baking, and salad dressings. It contains healthy monounsaturated
  and polyunsaturated fats along with some saturated fat.


  On the other hand, chili oil is made by infusing vegetable oil (commonly soybean
  or sesame) with dried red chilies and spices. This results in an oil with a strong
  peppery taste that is commonly used to add heat and flavor to dishes like stir-fries,
  dumplings, and noodles. The nutritional profile of chili oil will depend on its
  base oil but may contain higher amounts of certain vitamins due to the added spices.


  Given their distinct differences, canola oil and chili oil should not be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
