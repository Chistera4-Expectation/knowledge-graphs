text: No, 'Duck Gravy' and 'Duck Soup' should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from ducks, they are distinct food
  items with different ingredients, preparation methods, and culinary uses. Duck gravy
  is a sauce made from the drippings of cooked duck, while duck soup is a liquid dish
  containing pieces of cooked duck and other ingredients, typically served hot.
