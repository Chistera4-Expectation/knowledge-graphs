  While brown rice and short-grain rice can both fall under the general category of
  "rice," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct characteristics
  that make them unique. Brown rice is a type of whole grain rice with a chewy texture
  and nutty flavor, which is higher in fiber and nutrients compared to white rice.
  Short-grain rice, on the other hand, has a high starch content, making it sticky
  when cooked, and it''s commonly used in dishes like sushi and risotto. Therefore,
  merging these two instances would result in a loss of important distinctions between
  different types of rice.'
