text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are forms of water, they
  have different properties and sources. Boiling water is water that has reached its
  boiling point, which kills most microorganisms, making it safer for consumption.
  Glacier water is water sourced from glaciers and may contain natural minerals and
  nutrients. Merging them would not accurately represent their distinct characteristics.
