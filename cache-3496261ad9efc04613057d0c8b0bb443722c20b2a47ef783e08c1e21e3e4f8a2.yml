text: No, the instances 'A2 Butter' and 'Cultured Butter' should not be merged together
  as they have distinct characteristics and properties. A2 Butter refers to milk that
  contains the A2 type of beta-casein protein, while Cultured Butter is made from
  fermented cream, giving it a tangy flavor. These differences in composition and
  production methods make them separate entities in the context of a butter classification.
