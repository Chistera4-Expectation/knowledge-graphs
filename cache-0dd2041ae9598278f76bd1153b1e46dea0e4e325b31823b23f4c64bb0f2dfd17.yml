text: No, they should not be merged together. While both instances involve water,
  they serve different purposes and have different properties. Tap water is used for
  general consumption and is regulated for safety, while water for egg wash is specifically
  used for coating food items before cooking or baking and does not necessarily need
  to be potable.
