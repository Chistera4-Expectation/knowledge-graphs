text: ' No. Extra virgin olive oil and safflower oil are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, despite both being types of edible vegetable oils. They have different
  nutritional profiles, tastes, uses, and origins, making them distinct from one another.
  Merging these two concepts would result in loss of valuable information about their
  unique characteristics and properties.'
