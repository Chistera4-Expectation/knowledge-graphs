text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates because they
  represent different types of bread with distinct characteristics. 'Grilled Bread'
  refers to bread that has been cooked or heated on a grill, while 'White Bread' refers
  to a specific type of bread with a lighter color and different ingredients compared
  to other types of bread. Although they both fall under the category of "bread,"
  they have different attributes and preparation methods.
