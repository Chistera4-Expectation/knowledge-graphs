text: "No, the instances 'Grilled Bread' and 'Multigrain Bread' should not be merged\
  \ together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They represent different types\
  \ of bread with distinct characteristics: \n\n1. 'Grilled Bread': This refers to\
  \ bread that has been cooked on a grill, typically resulting in a slightly charred\
  \ and crispy texture on the surface.\n2. 'Multigrain Bread': This refers to bread\
  \ made from a mixture of different grains, providing additional nutrients and fiber\
  \ compared to traditional white bread.\n\nThese two types of bread have different\
  \ properties and are not duplicates in terms of their semantics or ontology."
