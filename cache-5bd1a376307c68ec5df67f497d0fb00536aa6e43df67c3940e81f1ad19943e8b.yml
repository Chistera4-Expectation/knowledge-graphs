  The two instances, "Sunflower oil" and "Vegetable oil for frying," are not exact
  duplicates. Although they share some similarities, they have distinct differences
  in terms of their specific characteristics, production processes, and uses in cooking.
  Sunflower oil is a specific type of vegetable oil that is extracted from sunflower
  seeds and has a high smoke point, making it suitable for frying. On the other hand,
  "Vegetable oil for frying" is a more general term that can refer to any vegetable
  oil that is used for frying purposes, including sunflower oil but also other types
  like peanut oil, canola oil, or blends. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them
  as separate instances in the Edible Vegetal Oil class.'
