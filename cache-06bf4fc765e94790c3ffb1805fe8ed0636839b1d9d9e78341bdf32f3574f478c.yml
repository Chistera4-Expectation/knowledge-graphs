  While blue cheese dressing and ranch dressing may have some similarities and overlap
  in terms of their ingredients and uses, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They represent distinct types of food dressings with unique flavors, textures, and
  histories. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate categories for accurate
  identification and description purposes.'
