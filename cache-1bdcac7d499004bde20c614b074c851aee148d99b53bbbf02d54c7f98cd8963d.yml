text: 'No, they should not be merged together. While both instances relate to cheese,
  they serve different purposes in a recipe or context. Mozzarella cheese is a specific
  type of cheese, while "Optional: additional cheese for topping" indicates a choice
  to add more cheese as a topping. They are distinct concepts and should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
