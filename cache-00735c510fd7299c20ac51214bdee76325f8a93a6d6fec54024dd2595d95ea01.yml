text: No, they should not be merged. Although both instances are derived from ostrich
  meat, they are different food items with distinct characteristics, preparation methods,
  and uses in recipes. 'Ostrich Gravy' is a sauce made from ostrich meat, while 'Ostrich
  Tenders' are pieces of ostrich meat prepared as a dish or ingredient. They serve
  different purposes in a meal and should be considered separate entities in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
