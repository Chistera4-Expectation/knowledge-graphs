text: No, they should not be merged together. While both instances involve pickled
  vegetables, 'Pickled mustard greens' refers specifically to a dish made from mustard
  greens, while 'Pickled vegetables' is a more general term for various vegetables
  that have been pickled. They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
