  While both Red Pepper Flakes and Scotch Bonnet Peppers are types of peppers, they
  have different properties and uses in cooking. Red Pepper Flakes typically refer
  to crushed red chili peppers that contain seeds and can vary in heat level. On the
  other hand, Scotch Bonnet Peppers are a specific variety of chili pepper known for
  their fruity flavor and intense heat level. Therefore, they cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates.'
