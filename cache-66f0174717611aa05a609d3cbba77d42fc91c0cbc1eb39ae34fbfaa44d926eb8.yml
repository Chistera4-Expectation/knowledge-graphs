text: No, 'Coral Shrimp' and 'Ghost Shrimp' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are two different species of edible crustaceans,
  with distinct characteristics, appearances, and culinary uses. Coral Shrimp, also
  known as Caridina cf. cantonensis, is a popular aquarium shrimp species native to
  Taiwan, while Ghost Shrimp, also known as Palaemonetes paludosus, is a freshwater
  shrimp species native to North America. Merging them as duplicates would not accurately
  represent their unique attributes and classification in the Edible Crustaceans class.
