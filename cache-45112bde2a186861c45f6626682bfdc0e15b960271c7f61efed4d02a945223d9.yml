text: No, the instances 'Amaranth Seeds' and 'Papaya Seeds' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible seeds, they belong
  to different plant species and have different nutritional profiles. Amaranth seeds
  come from the Amaranthus genus, while papaya seeds come from the Carica papaya plant.
  Merging them would create confusion and misrepresent the unique properties and uses
  of each seed.
