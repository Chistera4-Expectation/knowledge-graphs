text: No, Quail Gizzards and Quail Meatballs should not be merged as they are not
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Quail Gizzards are a specific part of the quail
  (the gizzard), while Quail Meatballs are a dish made from ground quail meat, which
  can include various parts of the quail. They are distinct food items with different
  nutritional profiles and culinary applications.
