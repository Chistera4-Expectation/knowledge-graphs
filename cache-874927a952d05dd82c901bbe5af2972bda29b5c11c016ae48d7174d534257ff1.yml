text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of tea, they have
  distinct flavors and characteristics. Earl Grey tea is flavored with bergamot oil,
  giving it a citrusy taste, while English Breakfast tea is a blend of black teas
  with a robust, malty flavor. They are not semantic or ontological duplicates, as
  they represent different types of tea with unique properties.
