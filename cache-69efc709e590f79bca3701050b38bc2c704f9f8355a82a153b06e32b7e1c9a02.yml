text: ' No, Cannellini beans and Green beans are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They belong to different categories of vegetables: Cannellini beans are part of
  the legume family while Green beans are considered fruits (though often prepared
  like vegetables) that belong to the Fabaceae family. Therefore, they should not
  be merged together.'
