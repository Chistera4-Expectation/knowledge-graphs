text: No, these two instances should not be merged together. While both are types
  of yogurt, they differ in their composition (fat content and dairy base). Low-Fat
  Yogurt is a dairy product with reduced fat content, while Non-Dairy Yogurt is made
  from non-dairy alternatives, such as plant-based milks. They serve different dietary
  needs and preferences.
