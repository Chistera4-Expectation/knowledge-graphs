text: ' "Tea" would be the most appropriate class for "Flavorings," as tea leaves
  themselves have many natural flavor profiles and can be infused with various herbs,
  fruits, spices, and other plants to create an array of flavors. Coffee and infusion
  drinks also have their own unique flavors but are often enhanced or modified with
  additives such as sugar, milk, and syrups. Tea offers more inherent diversity in
  terms of flavor without requiring additional ingredients.'
