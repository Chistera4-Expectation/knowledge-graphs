text: ' No. Basmati rice and short-grain rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They belong to different categories of rice based
  on their physical characteristics, taste, and usage. While Basmati rice is long-grained
  with a nutty flavor and used primarily for aromatic dishes, short-grain rice has
  a sticky texture when cooked and is commonly used in dishes like sushi and risotto.'
