text: No, Basmati Rice and Long-grain Rice should not be merged as they have distinct
  differences in terms of origin, aroma, and texture. While both are long-grain rice
  varieties, Basmati Rice has a distinct aroma and is typically grown in India and
  Pakistan, whereas Long-grain Rice refers to a broader category of rice that includes
  various types of rice with long grains, such as American long-grain rice and Thai
  Jasmine rice.
