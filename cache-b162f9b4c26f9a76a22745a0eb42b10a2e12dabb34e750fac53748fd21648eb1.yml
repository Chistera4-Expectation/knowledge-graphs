text: No, Almond Oil and Cooking Oil are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While
  both are edible oils, they have distinct properties, uses, and compositions. Almond
  Oil is derived from almond nuts, while Cooking Oil can be derived from various sources,
  including plant seeds, nuts, or even animal fats. These differences make them separate
  entities in terms of semantics and ontology.
