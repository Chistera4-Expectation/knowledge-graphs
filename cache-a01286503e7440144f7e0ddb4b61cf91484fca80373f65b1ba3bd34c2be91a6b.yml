text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from guinea fowl, they are different dishes with distinct preparation
  methods, ingredients, and nutritional values. Guinea Fowl Gravy is typically a sauce
  made from the drippings of roasted guinea fowl, while Guinea Fowl Soup is a broth-based
  dish that may contain other ingredients like vegetables and herbs.
