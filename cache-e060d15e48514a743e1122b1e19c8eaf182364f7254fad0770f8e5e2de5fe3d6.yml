text: ' No. Feta cheese and Parmesan cheese are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together as the same instance. While both are types
  of cheese, they have distinct characteristics, origins, textures, flavors, uses,
  and production methods that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it is
  important to keep these two instances separate in any classification system for
  cheeses.'
