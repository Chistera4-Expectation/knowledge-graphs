  Eucalyptus honey and strawberry honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they come from different sources: eucalyptus flowers for eucalyptus honey
  and strawberries for strawberry honey. They also have distinct flavor profiles,
  color, and other properties that make them unique. Therefore, it is important to
  keep these two types of honey separate rather than merging them together as duplicates.'
