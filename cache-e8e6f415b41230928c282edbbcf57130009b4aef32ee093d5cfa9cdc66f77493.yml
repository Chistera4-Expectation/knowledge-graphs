  While both brown rice and long-grain rice can belong to the category of "rice,"
  they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They have distinct characteristics:


  1. Brown rice is a type of whole grain rice that includes the bran layer, providing
  more fiber and nutrients compared to other types of rice. It has various forms such
  as short-, medium-, and long-grain brown rice.

  2. Long-grain rice refers to any variety of rice with grains longer than their width
  (typically above 3:1 length-to-width ratio). Examples include basmati, jasmine,
  and American long-grain rice. These varieties generally cook up dry and fluffy with
  separate grains due to lower starch content.


  Merging them would result in loss of essential distinctions between these two categories.'
