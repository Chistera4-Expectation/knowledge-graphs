text: "No, they should not be merged. Boiling water and hydrogen water have different\
  \ properties and uses, so they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Boiling\
  \ water is simply water heated to its boiling point (212\xB0F or 100\xB0C), while\
  \ hydrogen water is water that has had hydrogen gas added to it, which can have\
  \ potential health benefits. They are distinct concepts and should be treated as\
  \ separate instances."
