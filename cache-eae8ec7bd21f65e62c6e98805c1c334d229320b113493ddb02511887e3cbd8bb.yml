text: No, Hazelnut Oil and Pistachio Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetal oils, they have
  distinct properties, flavors, and uses in cooking and other applications. Merging
  them would lead to a loss of important information about each oil.
