text: ' The most adequate class for "Salted fish" would be "Edible Fish." Salted fish
  is a type of preserved fish that has been cured with salt, and it falls under the
  category of edible seafood. Other categories such as food seasonings or sauces may
  also include some types of salted fish products, but the primary ingredient in these
  foods is still fish, so the most appropriate classification is "Edible Fish."'
