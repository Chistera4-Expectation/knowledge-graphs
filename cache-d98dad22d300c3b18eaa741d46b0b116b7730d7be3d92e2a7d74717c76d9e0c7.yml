text: "No, B\xE9chamel sauce and Dark soy sauce should not be merged together as they\
  \ are different types of sauces with distinct ingredients and uses. They may have\
  \ the term \"sauce\" in common, but they belong to different cuisines and categories.\
  \ Merging them would create confusion and incorrect associations in the data structure."
