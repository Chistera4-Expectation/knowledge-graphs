  Kombucha tea and Rooibos tea are two different types of teas with distinct origins,
  flavors, and nutritional profiles. Kombucha is a fermented tea drink made from sweetened
  black or green tea, while Rooibos tea is an herbal tea made from the leaves of the
  Rooibos plant, which is native to South Africa. They have different taste profiles,
  with Kombucha having a tangy, fizzy taste and Rooibos tea being naturally caffeine-free
  and slightly sweet. Additionally, they have different nutritional content - Kombucha
  contains probiotics and some vitamins and minerals, whereas Rooibos tea is rich
  in antioxidants. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.'
