  While rice flour and rice paper wraps are both made from rice, they serve different
  purposes in cooking and have distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is not
  appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Rice flour is ground up rice that can be used as a gluten-free alternative to wheat
  flour for baking and thickening sauces. It has a mild flavor and contains carbohydrates,
  protein, and some fiber.


  On the other hand, rice paper wrappers are thin sheets made from rice flour, water,
  and sometimes tapioca starch. They are often used to make Vietnamese spring rolls
  or fresh summer rolls and do not contain any significant amount of nutrients beyond
  carbohydrates.


  Therefore, while there may be overlap in their usage due to being derived from rice,
  they cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates since they play unique
  roles in various dishes and possess diverse nutritional properties.'
