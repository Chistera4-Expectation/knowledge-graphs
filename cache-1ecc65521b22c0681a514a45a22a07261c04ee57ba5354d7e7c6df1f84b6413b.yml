  While Heather honey and Sage honey can both be classified under the general category
  of "honey," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they come from
  different botanical sources (heather flowers vs sage plants) and have distinct flavor
  profiles, properties, and potentially therapeutic benefits. Therefore, it is important
  to maintain them as separate entries with unique identifiers within a well-structured
  ontology for accurate information representation and data integration.'
