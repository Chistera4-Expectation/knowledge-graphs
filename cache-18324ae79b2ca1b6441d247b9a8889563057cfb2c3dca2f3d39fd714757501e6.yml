  The terms "browned butter" and "cultured butter" refer to different types of butter
  with distinct characteristics and production processes. Browned butter is made by
  cooking butter until it turns golden brown and develops a nutty flavor, while cultured
  butter is made by adding bacterial cultures to the cream before churning it into
  butter. These differences in production and taste justify keeping them as separate
  instances in the Butter class.'
