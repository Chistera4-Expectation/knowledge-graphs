text: As a dietician, I would recommend not merging 'Chicken Breast' and 'Turkey Breast'
  as they are different types of poultry and have distinct nutritional profiles. While
  they share some similarities, they also have differences in terms of protein content,
  fat content, and other nutrients. Therefore, merging them as duplicates would not
  be accurate or useful in a dietary context.
