text: "No, 'B\xE9chamel sauce' and 'Mole sauce' should not be merged together as they\
  \ are distinct types of sauces with different ingredients, preparation methods,\
  \ and uses. While both are sauces, they have unique characteristics and purposes,\
  \ making them separate entities in terms of semantics and ontology."
