  Peanut sauce and remoulade sauce are not semantic or ontological duplicates, as
  they have distinct ingredients and uses. Peanut sauce is typically made from peanuts,
  water, garlic, ginger, chili, sugar, and sometimes tamarind paste or soy sauce,
  while remoulade sauce usually consists of mayonnaise, mustard, capers, herbs like
  parsley or tarragon, and occasionally anchovies or Worcestershire sauce. These sauces
  also serve different culinary purposes: peanut sauce is often used in Southeast
  Asian dishes, particularly those with vegetables, tofu, or tempeh, whereas remoulade
  sauce is commonly found in French and New Orleans cuisine, accompanying seafood
  or sandwiches. Therefore, these two sauces should not be merged into one category
  based on their unique characteristics and applications.'
