text: No, Canola Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  different origins, compositions, and properties. Canola Oil is derived from rapeseed,
  while Wheat Germ Oil is extracted from the germ of the wheat kernel. They have distinct
  nutritional profiles and are used for different purposes in cooking and other applications.
