text: ' No. Arborio rice and wild rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. Although they share the common category of "rice,"
  they have distinct characteristics that make them unique from one another.


  Arborio rice is a type of Italian short-grain rice used for making risotto due to
  its high starch content, which gives it a creamy texture when cooked slowly with
  frequent stirring. In contrast, wild rice is actually an aquatic grass seed native
  to North America and Canada, known for its long, slender grains and nutty flavor.
  It has a higher protein and fiber content than most types of rice and requires longer
  cooking time. Therefore, merging these two instances would result in loss of important
  information about their differences.'
