  While Horseradish Dressing and Russian Dressing may have some similarities (such
  as containing horseradish), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  each have unique ingredients that set them apart from one another. For example,
  traditional Russian Dressing contains mayo, ketchup, and pickle relish, while Horseradish
  Dressing typically consists of mainly sour cream and grated horseradish. Therefore,
  it is important to keep these two dressings separate and distinct.'
