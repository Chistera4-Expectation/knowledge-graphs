text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Ostrich Meatballs' and 'Ostrich' are poultry-derived food items, they have different
  properties and usages. Ostrich Meatballs are a specific dish made from ostrich meat,
  while 'Ostrich' refers to the bird itself, which can be used in various other preparations,
  not just meatballs.
