text: No, they should not be merged together as they represent different parts of
  the ostrich and have different nutritional profiles. Ostrich gizzards are a specific
  organ, while ostrich meat refers to the muscle tissue of the bird. Although both
  are derived from ostriches, they should be treated as separate instances in the
  Poultry-derived Food class.
