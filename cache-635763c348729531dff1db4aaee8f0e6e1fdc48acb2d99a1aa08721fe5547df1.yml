text: No, 'Chestnut Honey' and 'Orange Blossom Honey' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they
  have distinct flavors and characteristics due to the different flowers the bees
  primarily collect nectar from. Chestnut honey has a strong, slightly bitter flavor,
  while orange blossom honey has a delicate, sweet, and citrusy flavor. Therefore,
  they should remain separate instances in the Honey class.
