text: No, the instances 'Dried Cameroon Pepper' and 'Red pepper flakes' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types
  of peppers, they are different in origin, appearance, and possibly flavor. Dried
  Cameroon Pepper is a specific type of pepper from Cameroon, while Red pepper flakes
  are a mix of dried and crushed red chili peppers. They have distinct properties
  and uses in culinary contexts.
