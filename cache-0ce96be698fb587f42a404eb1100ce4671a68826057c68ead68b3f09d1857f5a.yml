text: No, Avocado Oil and Palm Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different properties,
  nutritional values, and sources. Avocado Oil is derived from the fruit of the avocado
  tree, while Palm Oil is derived from the fruit of the oil palm tree. They have distinct
  compositions, uses, and impacts on health and the environment.
