text: No, 'Fresh Thyme' and 'Fresh cilantro' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both herbs, they have distinct flavors,
  uses, and botanical classifications. Merging them would not accurately reflect the
  differences between these two edible vegetables.
