text: No, Arborio Rice and Glutinous Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics
  and uses. Arborio Rice is an Italian short-grain rice used in risotto, while Glutinous
  Rice is a type of sticky rice used in various Asian dishes. They are not semantically
  or ontologically the same.
