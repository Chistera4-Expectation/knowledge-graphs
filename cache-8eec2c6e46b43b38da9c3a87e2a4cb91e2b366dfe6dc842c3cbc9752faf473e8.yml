  While both fresh ginger and fresh chili peppers belong to the broader category of
  edible vegetables, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They have distinct
  physical properties, flavors, uses, and nutritional profiles. Merging them would
  result in loss of essential information about each food item.'
