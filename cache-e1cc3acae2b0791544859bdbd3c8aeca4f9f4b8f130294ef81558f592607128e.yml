text: No, "Pheasant Nuggets" and "Pheasant Tenders" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from poultry (pheasant),
  they represent different forms or preparations of the food, and therefore, they
  should be treated as distinct instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
