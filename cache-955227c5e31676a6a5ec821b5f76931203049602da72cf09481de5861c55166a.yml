text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of yogurt with distinct
  characteristics. Drinkable yogurt is typically thinner in consistency and designed
  to be consumed as a beverage, while whole milk yogurt has a thicker consistency
  and typically contains more fat due to using whole milk as its base.
