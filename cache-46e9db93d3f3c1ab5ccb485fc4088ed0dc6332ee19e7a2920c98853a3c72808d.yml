  The two teas have different ingredients and preparation methods, resulting in distinct
  flavors and nutritional profiles. Berry Bliss Tea contains fruit juice and herbs,
  while Oolong Tea is made from leaves. They are not identical products and do not
  share all similarities, so they shouldn''t be combined as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
