text: No, Flaxseed Milk and Goat's Milk should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of milk with different nutritional profiles and origins. Flaxseed
  Milk is a plant-based milk alternative made from flaxseeds, while Goat's Milk is
  an animal-based milk derived from goats. These differences make them unique and
  not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
