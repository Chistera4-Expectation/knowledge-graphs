text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they both come from the same
  animal source (chicken), they are distinctly different types of food with different
  nutritional compositions and uses in cooking. Chicken liver is an organ meat with
  a specific nutrient profile, while chicken soup is a liquid dish that may or may
  not contain liver, and can vary in its ingredients and nutritional content.
