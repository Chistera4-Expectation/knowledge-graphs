text: No, they should not be merged. While they both belong to the Rice class, they
  have different preparation methods and uses. Steamed white rice typically refers
  to plain, cooked white rice, while Sushi Rice is specifically prepared with rice
  vinegar, sugar, and salt for use in sushi rolls. These differences in preparation
  and usage make them distinct instances within the Rice class.
