  While both olive oil and safflower oil are types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, taste, smoke points,
  and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. It is important to maintain separate categories for
  each type of oil to accurately reflect their unique properties and applications.'
