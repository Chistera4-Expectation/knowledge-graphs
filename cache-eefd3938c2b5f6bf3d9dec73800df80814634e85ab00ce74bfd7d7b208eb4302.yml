text: No, they should not be merged as they are two distinct types of juice with different
  nutritional profiles and characteristics. Although they both fall under the general
  category of "juice," they are unique in terms of their flavors, nutrient composition,
  and potential health benefits. Maintaining separate instances allows for more accurate
  and specific information about each type of juice.
