text: ' No. While both "Chicken tacos" and "Chicken" are related to poultry, they
  cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer to different
  food items with distinct nutritional profiles. Chicken is a type of poultry meat,
  while chicken tacos are a dish made using chicken meat along with other ingredients
  such as tortillas, vegetables, spices, etc., which contribute differently to overall
  nutrition.'
