text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates because
  they are distinct types of sauces with different ingredients, flavors, and uses.
  Mustard sauce typically consists of mustard, vinegar, and other seasonings, while
  Scotch bonnet pepper sauce is made with Scotch bonnet peppers and other ingredients
  for a spicy flavor. Although both are sauces, they have unique characteristics that
  differentiate them from each other.
