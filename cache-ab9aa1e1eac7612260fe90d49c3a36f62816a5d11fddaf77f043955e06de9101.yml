text: No, Dungeness Crab and Snow Crab should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they are both edible crustaceans, they are distinct
  species with different characteristics, habitats, and nutritional profiles. Merging
  them would lead to a loss of specific information and could be misleading for consumers
  and dietitians.
