text: ' No. Unsalted butter and bitter leaf are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They belong to different categories of food - unsalted butter is a dairy product
  made from churning cream, while bitter leaf is a type of vegetable commonly used
  in certain cuisines for its distinctive taste. Therefore, they cannot be merged
  together as duplicates.'
