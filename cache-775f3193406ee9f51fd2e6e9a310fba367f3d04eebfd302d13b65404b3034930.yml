text: "No, they should not be merged as they have distinct ingredients, preparation\
  \ methods, and uses. B\xE9chamel sauce is a white sauce made with milk, butter,\
  \ and flour, while sour sauce typically contains vinegar or citrus juice and is\
  \ used as a condiment or marinade. These sauces are not semantic or ontologic duplicates."
