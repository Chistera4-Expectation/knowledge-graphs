text: No, the instances 'Lotus Leaf Rice' and 'other leafy greens' should not be merged
  as they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. 'Lotus Leaf Rice' is a dish made
  with lotus leaves, while 'other leafy greens' refers to a broader category of green,
  leafy vegetables. They are different in nature and should be kept as separate instances
  in the Edible Vegetable class.
