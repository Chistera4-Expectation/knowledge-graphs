text: No, the instances 'Flavored Water' and 'Rain Water' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the broader category
  of drinking water, they have distinct differences in terms of their composition,
  sources, and uses. Flavored water is typically tap or bottled water with added natural
  or artificial flavors, while rainwater is collected directly from rainfall and may
  or may not be treated before consumption.
