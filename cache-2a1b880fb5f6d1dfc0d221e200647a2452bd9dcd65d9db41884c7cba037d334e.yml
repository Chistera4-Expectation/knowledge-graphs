text: ' The most appropriate category for goat meat would be ''Edible Meat.'' However,
  since this option is not listed in the given categories, it could also fit under
  ''Pork-derived Food'' or ''Poultry-derived Food,'' as both of these options include
  various types of meats. But ideally, there should be an ''Edible Meat'' category
  to place goat meat accurately.'
