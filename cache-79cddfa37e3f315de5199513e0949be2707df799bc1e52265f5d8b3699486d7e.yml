  While cantaloupe seeds and grape seeds are both types of edible seeds, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come from different fruits, have different
  nutritional profiles, and may be used differently in cooking and nutrition. Therefore,
  it is important to maintain them as separate instances to preserve accurate and
  distinct information about each type of seed.'
