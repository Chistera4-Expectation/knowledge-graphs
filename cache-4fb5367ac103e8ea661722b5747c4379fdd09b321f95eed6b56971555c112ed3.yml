text: ' No. Corn oil and olive oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged together. While they are both types of edible vegetable oils,
  they come from different plants (corn vs. olives) and have different nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate
  entities in a classification system for edible oils.'
