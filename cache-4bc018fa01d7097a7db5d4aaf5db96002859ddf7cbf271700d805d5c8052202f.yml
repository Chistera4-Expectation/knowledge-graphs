text: ' No. Creamed honey and sage honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. They refer to different types of honey products with distinct
  characteristics.


  Creamed honey is regular honey that has been processed to create a smooth, spreadable
  consistency by controlling its crystallization. The creaming process involves seeding
  the honey with fine crystals and then churning it at controlled temperatures until
  it reaches the desired texture. It can be made from various kinds of honey, including
  clover, alfalfa, buckwheat, or wildflower honey.


  On the other hand, Sage honey is a specific type of honey produced primarily from
  nectar collected from the flowers of the Salvia officinalis plant (common sage).
  This monofloral honey originates mainly from regions around the Mediterranean basin
  such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Its color ranges from light amber to darker
  shades, depending on factors like soil composition, climate, and harvest time. Additionally,
  sage honey possesses unique flavor profiles characterized by herbal, floral, and
  slightly bitter notes, making it distinguishable from other honeys.'
