text: ' No. Fiber per serving and Total fat per serving are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While both provide information about the nutritional content of cheese,
  they measure different aspects: fiber is a type of carbohydrate that promotes digestive
  health, while fat is a macronutrient with a higher calorie density than fiber. Merging
  these two properties would result in loss of important distinctions regarding the
  composition of various cheeses.'
