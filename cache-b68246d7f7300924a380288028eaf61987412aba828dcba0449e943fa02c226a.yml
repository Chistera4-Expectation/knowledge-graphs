  While diced celery and diced onions may share some common characteristics (both
  are vegetables that can be diced), they have distinct nutritional profiles, flavors,
  textures, and uses in recipes. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate
  entities with their own specific properties and purposes. Merging them would result
  in loss of valuable information about each individual vegetable.'
