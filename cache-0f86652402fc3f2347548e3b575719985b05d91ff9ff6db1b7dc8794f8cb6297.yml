  While both chicken broth and chicken are derived from poultry, they serve different
  purposes nutritionally and culinarily. Chicken is a source of protein, while chicken
  broth is primarily a liquid that can be used for cooking and may contain some vitamins
  and minerals depending on how it is made. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
