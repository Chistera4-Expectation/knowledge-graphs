text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both instances are derived from the same animal, the preparation methods and resulting
  food items are different. "Guinea Fowl Patties" likely refers to ground or minced
  guinea fowl formed into patties, whereas "Guinea Fowl Soup" refers to a liquid-based
  dish containing pieces of guinea fowl. These are distinct food items and should
  be kept separate in the ontology.
