text: ' No. Avocado oil and peanut oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils. They come
  from different plant sources (avocados vs. peanuts) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles, production processes, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is essential
  to maintain them as separate entries with their unique properties and characteristics.'
