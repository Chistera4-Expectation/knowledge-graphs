text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Infused
  Tea and Pu-erh Tea are different types of tea with distinct characteristics. Infused
  Tea typically refers to any tea made by steeping tea leaves in hot water, while
  Pu-erh Tea is a specific variety of fermented and aged tea from China. Although
  both are types of tea, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates because they
  possess unique properties and classifications.
