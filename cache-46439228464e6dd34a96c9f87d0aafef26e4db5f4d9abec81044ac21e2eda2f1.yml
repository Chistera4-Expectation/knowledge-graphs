  Although chia seeds and watermelon seeds have some similarities (for example, they
  are both sources of nutrients), they belong to different categories of seeds with
  distinct characteristics and uses. Chia seeds come from the Salvia hispanica plant
  and are known for their high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and antioxidants.
  Watermelon seeds, on the other hand, originate from the Citrullus lanatus plant
  and contain essential minerals like magnesium, iron, and folate. Merging these two
  instances would not accurately reflect their unique properties and applications.'
