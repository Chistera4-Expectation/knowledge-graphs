text: 'As a dietician, my expertise is in nutrition and not in software development
  or information architecture. However, from a nutritional perspective, Cuban bread
  and Sourdough bread have distinct differences in ingredients, preparation methods,
  and nutritional values. Therefore, it would be appropriate to treat them as separate
  instances in a Bread class.


  In terms of semantics and ontology, if the Bread class is designed to capture the
  unique characteristics and properties of different types of bread, then Cuban bread
  and Sourdough bread should not be merged as duplicates. If they were merged, it
  would be difficult to accurately represent the differences between them, which could
  impact the usefulness of the class for those using it to understand the nutritional
  properties of various types of bread.'
