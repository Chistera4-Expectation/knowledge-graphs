text: No, "Boiling water" and "Well water" should not be merged together as they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates. Boiling water refers to the process of heating
  water to its boiling point, while well water refers to water sourced from a well,
  which can be consumed without boiling. They are distinct concepts with different
  properties and uses.
