text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct differences in preparation
  and nutritional value. Parboiled rice undergoes a steaming process before being
  dried and milled, which alters its nutrient profile compared to steamed white rice.
  Additionally, their cooking methods differ, with parboiled rice requiring less water
  and time to cook.
