text: No, while they both fall under the category of Poultry-derived Food and are
  gizzards, they come from different types of poultry (duck and turkey). As such,
  they have different nutritional profiles and preparation methods, so it would not
  be accurate to merge them as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
