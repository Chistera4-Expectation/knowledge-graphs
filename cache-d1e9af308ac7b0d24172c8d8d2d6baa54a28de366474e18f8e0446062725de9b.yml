text: ' No. While chili peppers and red pepper flakes are related, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Chili peppers are whole fruits from various Capsicum
  species, while red pepper flakes are made by crushing and drying these fruits into
  small flake-like pieces. Therefore, they have distinct culinary uses and nutritional
  profiles.'
