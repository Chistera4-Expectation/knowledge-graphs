text: No, Pumpkin Seed Oil and Rice Bran Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are vegetable oils, they have different
  nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses. Pumpkin Seed Oil is rich in antioxidants,
  unsaturated fatty acids, and essential minerals, while Rice Bran Oil has a high
  smoke point and is rich in vitamin E, antioxidants, and unsaturated fats. Merging
  them would disregard these important differences.
