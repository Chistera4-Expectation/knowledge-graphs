text: No, Chili oil and Coconut oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have different
  properties, flavors, and uses. Chili oil is made from chili peppers and has a spicy
  flavor, while coconut oil is made from the meat of coconuts and has a mild, nutty
  flavor. The two oils serve different purposes in cooking and food preparation.
