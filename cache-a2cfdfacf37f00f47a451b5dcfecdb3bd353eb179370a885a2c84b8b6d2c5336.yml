text: No, they should not be merged. "Savory Yogurt" and "Whole Milk Yogurt" are different
  types of yogurt with distinct characteristics. Savory Yogurt refers to yogurt flavored
  with savory ingredients, while Whole Milk Yogurt refers to yogurt made from whole
  milk. These two types of yogurt can be considered separate instances in the Yogurt
  class.
