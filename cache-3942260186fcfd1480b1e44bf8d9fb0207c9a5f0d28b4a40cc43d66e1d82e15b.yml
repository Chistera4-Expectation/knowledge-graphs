  While both Guajillo chiles and red chili powder may be used to add spice to dishes,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Guajillo chiles refer to specific
  type of dried chile pepper with a unique flavor profile, while red chili powder
  is a ground spice that can be made from various types of chilies, including guajillo
  peppers. Therefore, they represent different concepts and should not be merged.'
