text: No, Brown Rice and Jasmine Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the category of "Rice," they have
  distinct characteristics, such as taste, texture, and nutritional content. Brown
  Rice is a whole grain, while Jasmine Rice is a type of long-grain white rice. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate instances within the Rice class.
