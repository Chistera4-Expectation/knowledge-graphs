text: No, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Sesame Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of edible vegetable oils,
  they have distinct properties, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking and other
  applications. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
