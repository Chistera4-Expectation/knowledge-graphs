  While both "chicken pieces" and "low-sodium chicken broth" are derived from poultry,
  they serve different purposes nutritionally and culinarily. Chicken pieces consist
  of actual cuts of meat (such as breasts, thighs, or wings), while low-sodium chicken
  broth is a liquid made by simmering bones, vegetables, and seasonings to extract
  flavor. Merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates would not accurately
  reflect their distinct roles in food preparation and nutrition.'
