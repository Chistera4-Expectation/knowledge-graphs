text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Pumpkin Seeds and Seeds are
  related, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Pumpkin Seeds are a specific
  type of seed, whereas Seeds is a more general term that encompasses a wide variety
  of plant reproduction units. Merging them together would result in a loss of information
  and specificity.
