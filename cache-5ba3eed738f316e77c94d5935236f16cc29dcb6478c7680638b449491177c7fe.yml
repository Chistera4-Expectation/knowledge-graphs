text: No, Lavender Honey and Raspberry Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different types of honey derived from different
  sources, which affects their taste, aroma, and nutritional properties. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the distinct characteristics of each honey variety.
