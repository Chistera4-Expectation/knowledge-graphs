text: No, the instances 'Rock Crab' and 'Stone Crab' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are crustaceans and can be considered edible,
  they are different species with distinct characteristics and behaviors. Rock Crabs
  (Cancer irroratus) are smaller than Stone Crabs (Menippe mercenaria) and are typically
  found in the Atlantic Ocean, while Stone Crabs are larger and more commonly found
  in the Gulf of Mexico and along the southeastern coast of the United States.
