text: No, 'Chicken Thighs' and 'Duck Thighs' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are poultry-derived food items, they are distinct
  products with different nutritional profiles, tastes, and textures. They should
  be treated as separate instances in a dietary or nutritional classification system.
