text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are derived from poultry,
  specifically chicken, they are different types of food with distinct nutritional
  profiles and preparation methods. Chicken feet are typically used in various cuisines
  and contain high amounts of collagen and gelatin, while chicken nuggets are processed
  and often breaded or battered, with varying nutritional values depending on the
  ingredients and preparation methods.
