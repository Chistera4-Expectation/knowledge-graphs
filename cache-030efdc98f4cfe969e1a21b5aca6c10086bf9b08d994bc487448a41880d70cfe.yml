  Although acacia honey and comb honey may both belong to the broader category of
  "honey," they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. Acacia honey is a type
  of honey produced by bees that gather nectar from acacia trees, while comb honey
  refers to honey that is still contained within the hexagonal wax cells constructed
  by honeybees. Therefore, these two types of honey have distinct characteristics
  and uses, making them separate entities within the domain of honey classification.'
