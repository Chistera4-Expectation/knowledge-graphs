text: No, Catfish and Swordfish should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they both belong to the Edible Fish class, they have distinct
  characteristics, such as their physical appearance, habitat, and nutritional content.
  Merging them would disregard these unique features and create confusion.
