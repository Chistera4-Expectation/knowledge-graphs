  Cajun seasoning and seasoning cubes are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  despite sharing some similarities related to their use as food flavorings. Cajun
  seasoning is a blend of herbs and spices commonly used in Creole and Cajun cooking
  from the southern United States, which typically includes ingredients such as paprika,
  garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and oregano. On the other
  hand, seasoning cubes (also known as bouillon cubes) consist of dehydrated vegetables,
  meat, or seafood extracts, salt, and various spices, compacted into a solid form
  that dissolves when added to hot liquids for enhancing savory flavors in soups,
  stews, and sauces. Both have distinct uses, compositions, and purposes; thus, they
  should remain separate instances within the context of a Food Seasoning class.'
