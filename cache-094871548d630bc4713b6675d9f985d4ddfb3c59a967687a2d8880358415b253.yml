text: ' No. Corned beef and lean beef are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They refer to different types of beef products
  with distinct characteristics and uses in cooking. Corned beef is beef that has
  been preserved by dry-curing or pickling in a brine solution, often resulting in
  a salty flavor and tender texture. Lean beef, on the other hand, refers to cuts
  of beef that have minimal fat content, making them a healthier option for those
  watching their calorie intake. While both corned beef and lean beef come from cattle,
  they differ significantly in terms of preparation, nutritional value, and culinary
  applications, so it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as duplicates.'
