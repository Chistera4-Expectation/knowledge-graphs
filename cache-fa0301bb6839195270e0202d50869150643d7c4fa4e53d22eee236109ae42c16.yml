  In this context, "vegetable broth" refers to a savory liquid made by simmering vegetables
  in water, while "vegetable shortening" refers to a type of fat used in cooking and
  baking that is derived from vegetable oils. These are two distinct concepts with
  different culinary uses and properties, so they should not be merged as duplicates.'
