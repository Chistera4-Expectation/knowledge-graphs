text: ' No. Honey Lime Dressing and Honey Mustard Dressing are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While both dressings may contain honey as an ingredient, they have distinct
  flavors due to the addition of lime in Honey Lime Dressing and mustard in Honey
  Mustard Dressing. Therefore, they should be kept as separate entities.'
