text: ' No. Cherry Blossom Honey and Sage Honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they come from different botanical sources (cherry blossoms vs sage) and
  have distinct flavor profiles, properties, and potentially health benefits. Therefore,
  it is important to keep them separate and maintain their individual distinctions
  within the honey class.'
