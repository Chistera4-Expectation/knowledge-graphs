text: ' "Dairy" would be the most appropriate broad classification for these foods,
  but if we are looking for a single class name to differentiate cheese from butter,
  milk, and yogurt, I would suggest "Cheeses." Although it may seem redundant since
  all items in this list are dairy products, using the term "cheeses" allows you to
  specifically group and refer to various types of cheese while distinguishing them
  from other dairy options.'
