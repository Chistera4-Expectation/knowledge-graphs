text: No, Sesame Oil and Walnut Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  chemical compositions, flavors, and uses in cooking and other applications. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the differences between these two types of oil.
