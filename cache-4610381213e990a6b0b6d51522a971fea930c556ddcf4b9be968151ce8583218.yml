text: ' No. Fireweed honey and raw wildflower honey are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they are both types of honey. They have different taste,
  color, texture, and nutritional profiles due to the varying nectar sources from
  which the bees collect their pollen. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between
  these two varieties of honey when providing information about them.'
