  The instances "Chicken pieces" and "chicken sausages" are not exact duplicates,
  as they have different forms and textures. Chicken pieces refer to boneless, skinless
  chicken parts such as breasts, thighs, wings, and drumsticks, while chicken sausages
  are seasoned, ground chicken stuffed into casings, often with added ingredients
  like breadcrumbs and spices. They may share some similarities in terms of nutritional
  value, but their preparation methods and sensory characteristics differ. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate rather than merging them as duplicates.'
