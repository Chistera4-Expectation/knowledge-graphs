  While both cornmeal and instant oatmeal can be used as breakfast cereals, they are
  not semantic nor ontological duplicates. Semantically, they have different meanings
  and refer to distinct types of food products made from different grains (corn vs
  oats). Ontologically, they belong to separate categories: cornmeal is typically
  classified under grain foods or hot cereals, while instant oatmeal falls into the
  category of cooked cereals or oat-based products. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as duplicates.'
