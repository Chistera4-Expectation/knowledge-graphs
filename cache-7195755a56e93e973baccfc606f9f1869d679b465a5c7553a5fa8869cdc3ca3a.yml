text: ' The most adequate class for black-eyed peas would be "Edible Legumes" or simply
  "Legumes". However, since this option is not provided in the list, I will choose
  the closest relevant category. Therefore, based on the options given, the best choice
  for black-eyed peas would be "Edible Vegetables." Black-eyed peas are actually part
  of the legume family, but they can also be considered vegetables due to their edible
  seeds and pods.'
