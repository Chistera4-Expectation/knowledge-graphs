text: ' "ProteinSource"


  The rationale behind this classification is that crickets are an excellent source
  of protein, containing all nine essential amino acids required by the human body.
  They can be a healthy and sustainable alternative to traditional animal-based protein
  sources. Honey, on the other hand, belongs to the category of natural sweeteners
  or carbohydrates due to its high sugar content. By grouping crickets under "ProteinSource,"
  it highlights their nutritional benefits as a protein option in one''s diet.'
