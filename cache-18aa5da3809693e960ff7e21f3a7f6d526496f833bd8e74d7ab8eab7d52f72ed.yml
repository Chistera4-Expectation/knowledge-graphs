text: No, 'Raw Honey' and 'Tupelo Honey' should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have different characteristics
  and flavors. Raw honey refers to honey that is unheated, unpasteurized, and unprocessed,
  preserving its natural enzymes, vitamins, and minerals. Tupelo honey, on the other
  hand, is a specific type of honey derived from the nectar of Tupelo trees, known
  for its light color and unique flavor.
