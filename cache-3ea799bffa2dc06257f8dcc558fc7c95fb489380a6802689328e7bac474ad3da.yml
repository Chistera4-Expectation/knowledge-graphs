  While both chicken breasts and turkey are types of poultry and share some similarities,
  they have distinct nutritional profiles, taste, texture, and cultural uses. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate as different food items within the Poultry-derived
  Food class. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique characteristics
  and could lead to confusion regarding their specific properties.'
