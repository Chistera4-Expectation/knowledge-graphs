  While cooked rice and cooked white rice may seem similar, they are not exactly the
  same thing from both a semantic and an ontological perspective. Semantically, "cooked
  rice" is a more general term that can refer to any type of rice that has been cooked,
  while "cooked white rice" specifically refers to rice that has had its bran and
  germ removed (resulting in a white color) before being cooked. Ontologically, these
  two terms represent different subclasses within the broader category of "rice."
  Therefore, it would be incorrect to merge them as duplicates.'
