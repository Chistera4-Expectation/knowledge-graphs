text: ' I''m sorry, there seems to be a misunderstanding in your question. Honey is
  not a suitable class or category for earthworms. Earthworms are organisms that belong
  to the annelid phylum and live in soil, while honey is a sweet food substance produced
  by bees from nectar. Therefore, no concise class name can accurately represent both
  earthwoms and honey.'
