  While both "dipping sauce" and "oyster sauce" are types of sauces, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct properties and uses.
  Dipping sauce is a general term for any type of sauce that is used for dipping food
  into, while oyster sauce is a specific type of sauce made from oysters and typically
  used in Chinese cuisine. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two
  instances together.'
