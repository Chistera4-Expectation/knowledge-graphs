text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of honey, they
  are distinct in their characteristics and sources. Blueberry honey is a specific
  variety derived from blueberry flowers, while raw honey refers to honey that has
  not been heated or processed. They represent different categories within the classification
  of honey.
