  While blue cheese dressing and creamy garlic dressing may have some similarities
  (such as being types of salad dressings), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they contain different ingredients that give each their unique flavor and
  texture. Blue cheese dressing is made with crumbled blue cheese, while creamy garlic
  dressing typically contains pureed garlic and other seasonings mixed into a base
  like sour cream or yogurt. Therefore, merging these two instances would result in
  loss of specificity and accuracy regarding what distinguishes one from the other.'
