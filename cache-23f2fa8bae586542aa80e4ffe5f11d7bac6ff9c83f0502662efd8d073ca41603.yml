text: ' No. While both corn tortillas and tortillas can be considered types of edible
  vegetables (specifically grains), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they refer to different things. Tortillas is a more general term that includes
  all types of flatbreads commonly used in Mexican cuisine, while corn tortillas specifically
  refers to those made from ground cornmeal. Therefore, it would be incorrect to merge
  these two instances into one.'
