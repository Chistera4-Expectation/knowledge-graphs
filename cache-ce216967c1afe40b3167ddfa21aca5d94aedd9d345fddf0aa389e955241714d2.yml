text: ' The most adequate class for legumes would be "Edible Vegetables" or simply
  "Vegetables." While some people may categorize legumes as part of the "Pulses and
  Grains" group, they are technically considered vegetables due to their growth as
  seed-bearing plants in pods. However, it is worth noting that there can be overlap
  between categories depending on cultural definitions and culinary uses.'
