text: ' No. Extra virgin olive oil and vegetable oil are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged together. They have different nutritional profiles
  and come from distinct sources. Extra virgin olive oil is derived from the fruit
  of the olive tree (Olea europaea) and contains monounsaturated fats, antioxidants,
  and anti-inflammatory compounds. In contrast, vegetable oils are typically made
  by extracting fat from various plant sources like soybeans, corn, sunflower seeds,
  or safflower seeds. These oils usually contain polyunsaturated fats and may also
  provide some vitamin E and K depending on their specific source. Due to these differences,
  it is important to maintain separate categories for extra virgin olive oil and vegetable
  oil in an edible vegetal oil classification system.'
