  Although both chili oil and cottonseed oil are types of edible oils, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different physical properties,
  culinary uses, nutritional profiles, and sources. Chili oil is an infused oil made
  by steeping dried red chillies in vegetable oil such as sesame oil, while cottonseed
  oil is extracted from the seeds of cotton plants. They also differ in their flavor
  profiles, with chili oil having a spicy taste and cottonseed oil being relatively
  neutral in flavor. Additionally, they may contain varying amounts of saturated and
  unsaturated fats, which can impact their nutritional values. Therefore, it would
  be incorrect to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
