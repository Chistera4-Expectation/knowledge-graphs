text: No, Flaxseed Milk and Pea Milk should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the Milk class, they are derived
  from different plant sources (flaxseeds and peas, respectively) and have distinct
  nutritional profiles. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
