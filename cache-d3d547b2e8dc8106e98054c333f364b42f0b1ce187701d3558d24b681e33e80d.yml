text: No, Blackberry and Blueberry should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they may both be edible fruits, they are distinct species with
  unique characteristics, nutritional profiles, and taxonomic classifications. Merging
  them would lead to loss of specific information and misrepresentation of their individual
  properties.
