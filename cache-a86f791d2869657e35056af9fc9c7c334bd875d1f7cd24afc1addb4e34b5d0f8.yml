text: ' No. Eucalyptus honey and Tupelo honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While they may both fall under the category of
  "honey," they have distinct differences in terms of their source (the type of flower
  nectar used to make them), taste, color, consistency, and other properties. Therefore,
  it is important to maintain separate categories for these types of honey to accurately
  reflect their unique characteristics and uses.'
