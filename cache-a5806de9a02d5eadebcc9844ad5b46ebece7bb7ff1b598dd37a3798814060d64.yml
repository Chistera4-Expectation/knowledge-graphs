  The instances "Celery, sliced" and "Zucchini, sliced" are not duplicate entries.
  They represent two different vegetables that have been prepared in the same way
  (sliced). Each instance represents a unique combination of a specific vegetable
  and its preparation method, which justifies their separation into distinct instances
  in the Edible Vegetable class. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
