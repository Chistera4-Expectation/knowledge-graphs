  The two teas have different ingredients and nutritional profiles, so they should
  not be considered duplicates. Berry Bliss tea contains a blend of fruit juices and
  herbs, while Rooibos tea is made from the leaves of the Rooibos plant, which is
  native to South Africa. While both teas may share some similarities in terms of
  their antioxidant content, they are distinct products with unique characteristics
  and health benefits. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate rather than
  merging them as duplicates.'
