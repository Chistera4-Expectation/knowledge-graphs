text: No, "Pheasant Broth" and "Pheasant Eggs" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they both come from poultry, they are different
  types of food products with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Pheasant
  Broth is a liquid made by boiling pheasant meat and bones, while Pheasant Eggs are
  the reproductive cells laid by pheasants and are a source of protein and other nutrients.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived
  food options.
