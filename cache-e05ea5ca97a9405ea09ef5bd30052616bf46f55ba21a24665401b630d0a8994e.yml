text: ' Poultry-derived Food (specifically, "Poultry" instead of "Poultry-derived
  Food" would also be acceptable as the class name)


  Explanation: Chicken is a type of poultry. Therefore, it falls under the category
  of poultry-derived food. Beef and pork are types of meat from mammals, so they belong
  to different categories.'
