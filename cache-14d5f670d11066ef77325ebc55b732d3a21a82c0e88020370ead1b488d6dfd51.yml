text: ' No. Russian dressing and wasabi dressing are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They have different ingredients and flavors, with Russian dressing being creamy
  and tangy and wasabi dressing being spicy and pungent due to its use of horseradish.
  Therefore, they serve distinct purposes and cater to various taste preferences.'
