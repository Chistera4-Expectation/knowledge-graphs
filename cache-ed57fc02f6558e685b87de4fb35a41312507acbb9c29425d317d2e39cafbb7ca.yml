text: No, the instances 'Kiwi juice' and 'Tomato juice' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are juices, they are derived
  from different fruits and have distinct nutritional profiles and flavor characteristics.
  Maintaining them as separate instances allows for accurate representation of the
  differences between the two types of juice.
