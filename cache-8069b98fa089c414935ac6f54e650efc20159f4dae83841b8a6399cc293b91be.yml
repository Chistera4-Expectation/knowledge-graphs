text: ' No. Although poppy seeds and sesame seeds have some similarities (for example,
  they are both tiny seeds that can be used as toppings on bread), they also have
  many differences from a nutritional standpoint. Poppy seeds contain smaller amounts
  of fiber and healthy fats compared to sesame seeds, but higher levels of certain
  minerals like calcium and iron. They also contain different types of phytochemicals,
  which may have unique health benefits. Therefore, it is important to keep these
  two seed varieties separate when discussing their nutritional properties.'
