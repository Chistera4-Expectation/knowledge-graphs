text: No, they should not be merged together. Turkey Breast and Turkey Broth are different
  types of poultry-derived foods with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in recipes.
  Turkey Breast is a lean cut of meat, while Turkey Broth is a liquid made by simmering
  turkey bones and meat in water, which is rich in nutrients. Merging them together
  as duplicates would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
