text: ' No, Blueberries and Elderberries are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. While they are both types of berries, they belong to different
  genera (Vaccinium sect. Cyanococcus for blueberries and Sambucus for elderberries)
  and have distinct nutritional profiles, growth habits, and uses. Therefore, it is
  important to maintain them as separate categories to accurately represent their
  unique characteristics and properties.'
