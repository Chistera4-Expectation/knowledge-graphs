  While both instances are related to the topic of drinking water, they do not represent
  the same concept and therefore should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. "How often an individual is drinking water throughout the day" represents
  a behavior or action related to consuming water, while "Water" refers to the substance
  itself. Merging these two concepts would result in a loss of meaningful distinctions
  that could lead to confusion or incorrect interpretations.'
