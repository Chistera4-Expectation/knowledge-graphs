  The amounts of fat and protein in a juice are distinct nutritional components that
  provide different health benefits and contribute differently to overall nutrition
  goals. Therefore, it is appropriate for them to be represented separately rather
  than being combined as duplicate attributes. This allows more accurate tracking
  and analysis of individual macronutrients in the context of a healthy diet.'
