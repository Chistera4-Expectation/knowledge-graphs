  While both Achiote paste and Chili paste are used for seasoning food, they have
  different flavors, appearances, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Achiote paste is made from ground annatto seeds mixed with spices such as garlic,
  oregano, cumin, and salt. It has a mild flavor with earthy and slightly sweet notes
  and is commonly used in Mexican, Caribbean, and Central American cuisine. The paste
  gives dishes a vibrant orange-red color.


  On the other hand, chili paste can refer to various pastes made by grinding chilies
  into a smooth consistency, often combined with additional ingredients like vinegar,
  oil, sugar, and spices. Depending on the type of chili peppers used, the flavor
  profile of chili paste can range from mildly spicy to extremely hot, fruity, smoky,
  or tangy. Chili paste is widely utilized across many Asian and Latin American culinary
  traditions.'
