text: As a dietician, my answer is that it depends on the specific properties and
  ingredients of 'Infused Tea' and 'Lavender Tea.' If both are essentially the same
  in terms of their ingredients and preparation methods, they can be considered semantic
  and ontologic duplicates and may be merged. However, if they differ in their ingredients
  or preparation, they should be kept separate as distinct entities.
