text: ' No. Apple seeds and pomegranate seeds are not duplicate concepts. While both
  can be referred to as "seeds," they come from different types of fruits (apples
  and pomegranates) and have distinct nutritional profiles and characteristics. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate when discussing edible seeds.'
