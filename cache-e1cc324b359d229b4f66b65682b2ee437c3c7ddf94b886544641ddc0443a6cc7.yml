text: No, Amaranth Seeds and Sunflower Seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible seeds, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles and characteristics. Merging them would result in the loss
  of important information and make it difficult to accurately classify and compare
  the two types of seeds.
