text: No, while both chicken gizzards and pheasant gizzards are poultry-derived food
  items, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates as they come from different
  bird species and may have variations in nutritional content. Merging them together
  could lead to inaccuracies in dietary recommendations or analyses.
