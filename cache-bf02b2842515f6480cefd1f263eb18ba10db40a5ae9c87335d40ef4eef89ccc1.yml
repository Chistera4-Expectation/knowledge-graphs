  While both chicken wings and fried chicken are types of poultry-derived food, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct characteristics
  and properties. Chicken wings refer to a specific cut from the bird that can be
  prepared in various ways (grilled, baked, boiled, etc.). On the other hand, "fried
  chicken" is a preparation method for any part of the chicken, but it typically refers
  to breaded and deep-fried pieces. Merging them would result in losing this important
  distinction.'
