  While both flaxseed oil and olive oil are types of edible vegetable oils, they have
  different nutritional profiles, uses, and culinary properties that make them distinct
  from each other. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Flaxseed oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which makes
  it suitable for adding to smoothies or salad dressings as a supplement, while olive
  oil has a higher smoke point and is commonly used for cooking and frying due to
  its mild flavor and stability at high temperatures. Merging these two concepts would
  result in loss of important distinctions between them.'
