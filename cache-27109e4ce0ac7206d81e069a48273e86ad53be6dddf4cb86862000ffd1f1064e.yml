text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are types of honey, they have distinct characteristics and flavors. Blueberry honey
  is derived from blueberry flowers, while chestnut honey comes from chestnut tree
  flowers. They have different nutritional profiles and can be used in different culinary
  applications. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the
  Honey class.
