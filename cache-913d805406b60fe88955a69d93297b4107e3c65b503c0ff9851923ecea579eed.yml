text: No, Basmati Rice and Jasmine Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the rice class, they have
  distinct properties and characteristics such as aroma, texture, and taste. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate instances within the rice class.
