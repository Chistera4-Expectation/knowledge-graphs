text: 'No, the instances ''Optional: additional cheese for topping'' and ''Pecorino
  Romano cheese'' should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They serve different purposes: ''Optional: additional cheese for topping'' is a
  general description of an optional ingredient, while ''Pecorino Romano cheese''
  is a specific type of cheese that can be used for topping or other purposes. Merging
  them would create confusion and limit the flexibility of the class.'
