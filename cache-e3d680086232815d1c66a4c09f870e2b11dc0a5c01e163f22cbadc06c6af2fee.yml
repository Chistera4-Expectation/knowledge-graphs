text: ' No. Greek Dressing and Soy Sauce Dressing are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  While both may be used as dressings, they have distinct ingredients and flavors.
  Greek Dressing is typically made with olive oil, vinegar, garlic, and various herbs
  and spices, while Soy Sauce Dressing is primarily made from soy sauce and sometimes
  includes other ingredients such as sugar, rice vinegar, ginger, and garlic.'
