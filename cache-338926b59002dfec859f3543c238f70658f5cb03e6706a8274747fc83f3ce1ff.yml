text: No, Balsamic Glaze and Salsa should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are distinct food dressings with different ingredients, flavors,
  and uses. Balsamic Glaze is made from balsamic vinegar and is typically used as
  a sweet and tangy topping, while Salsa is made from a combination of vegetables,
  herbs, and spices, and is usually used as a spicy condiment.
