  While both "Optional dipping sauce" and "Tomato sauce" may appear to be related
  to sauces, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. An optional dipping
  sauce could refer to any type of sauce that is served on the side for dipping (such
  as ranch dressing or soy sauce), whereas tomato sauce specifically refers to a sauce
  made primarily from tomatoes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two instances.'
