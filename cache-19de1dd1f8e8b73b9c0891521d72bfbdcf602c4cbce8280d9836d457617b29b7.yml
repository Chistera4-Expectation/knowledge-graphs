  While both Hard Water and Spring-fed Water are types of drinking water, they have
  distinct characteristics and properties that differentiate them from each other.
  Hard Water is characterized by its high mineral content, specifically calcium and
  magnesium, while Spring-fed Water is naturally filtered groundwater that emerges
  from the earth. Merging these two instances would lead to a loss of important information
  and distinctions.
