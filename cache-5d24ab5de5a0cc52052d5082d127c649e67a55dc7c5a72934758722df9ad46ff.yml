text: No, 'Pork Sausage' and 'Pork' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both derived from pork, they represent different food
  items. Pork refers to the meat from a pig, whereas Pork Sausage is a specific preparation
  of pork combined with seasonings and stuffed into a casing. They have distinct nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses, so they should be considered separate entities in the
  Pork-derived Food class.
