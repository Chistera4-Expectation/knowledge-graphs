text: ' The most adequate class for habanero peppers would be "Spice." Habaneros are
  known for their intense heat and flavor, which makes them popular additions to various
  dishes as a way to spice things up. Other classes like "Edible Vegetables" or "Food
  Seasonings" could also work, but since habaneros have a very distinct use case (adding
  heat), the category of "Spice" is the best fit.'
