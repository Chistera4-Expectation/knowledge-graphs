  Fish sauce and hot sauce are distinct culinary concepts with unique flavors, ingredients,
  and uses in various cuisines. While they may share similarities in being sauces,
  they differ significantly in their flavor profiles, cultural associations, and culinary
  contexts. Merging them as semantic and ontologic duplicates would lose the distinct
  identities and cultural significance of each sauce.'
