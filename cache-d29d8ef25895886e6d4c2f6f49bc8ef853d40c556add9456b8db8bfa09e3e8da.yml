text: No, Canola Oil and Rice Bran Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both vegetable oils, they have different
  properties, origins, and uses. Canola Oil is derived from the seeds of the canola
  plant, while Rice Bran Oil comes from the germ and inner husk of rice. They also
  have distinct nutritional profiles and are used in different culinary applications.
