text: ' No. Turkey chili and turkey slices are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  because they refer to different types of food products with distinct ingredients,
  preparation methods, and uses. Turkey chili is a dish made by simmering ground turkey
  meat with various seasonings, vegetables, and sometimes beans, while turkey slices
  typically refer to thinly cut pieces of cooked turkey breast or other parts of the
  bird that can be used for sandwiches or salads. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances into one.'
