text: No, they should not be merged together. Artificial sweeteners and sweetened
  condensed milk are different types of sweeteners with distinct characteristics and
  uses. Artificial sweeteners are low-calorie, non-nutritive substitutes for sugar,
  while sweetened condensed milk is a high-calorie, nutritive sweetener made by evaporating
  water from milk and adding sugar. They belong to different categories and serve
  different purposes in food and beverages.
