text: No, the instances 'Coffee' and 'Drip Coffee' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. 'Coffee' is a general term for the beverage,
  while 'Drip Coffee' is a specific type of coffee preparation method. Although they
  both fall under the broader category of coffee, they are distinct entities with
  different characteristics and properties.
