text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of sauces with
  distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses. Tartar sauce typically consists of mayonnaise,
  capers, gherkins, and other seasonings, while Teriyaki sauce is a Japanese sauce
  made from soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients like ginger or
  garlic. These sauces have different culinary applications and should be treated
  as separate entities in the Sauce class.
