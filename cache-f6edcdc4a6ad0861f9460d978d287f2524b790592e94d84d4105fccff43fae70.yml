text: No, Hemp Seed Oil and Palm Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of edible vegetable oils with different
  properties, nutritional profiles, and sources. Hemp Seed Oil is derived from the
  seeds of the hemp plant, while Palm Oil is derived from the fruit of oil palm trees.
  They have different uses, nutrient compositions, and impacts on the environment
  and human health.
