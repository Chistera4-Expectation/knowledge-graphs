text: " No.\n\nIn the context of edible vegetable oils, \"vegetable oil\" generally\
  \ refers to a neutral-tasting oil that is suitable for use in a variety of dishes,\
  \ such as stir-fries, saut\xE9ed vegetables, and baked goods. \"Vegetable oil for\
  \ frying,\" on the other hand, typically refers to a specific type of vegetable\
  \ oil that has been formulated for deep-frying foods, such as French fries, chicken,\
  \ and doughnuts. These two types of oils may have different smoke points, flavor\
  \ profiles, and nutritional content, so it would not be appropriate to merge them\
  \ as semantic and ontological duplicates."
