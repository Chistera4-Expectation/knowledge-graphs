text: Yes, as a dietician, I would consider "Enoki Mushroom" and "Enoki mushrooms"
  to be semantic and ontological duplicates, as they refer to the same type of edible
  mushroom. It would be more appropriate to have a single entry in the Edible Mushrooms
  class to avoid confusion and redundancy.
