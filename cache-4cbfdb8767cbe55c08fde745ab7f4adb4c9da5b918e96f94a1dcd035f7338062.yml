  The amount of protein in a juice per serving is a factual attribute or property
  of the juice, not a duplicate of the concept "juice" itself. It would not be appropriate
  to merge these two concepts together. Instead, it makes more sense for them to remain
  separate entities within your ontology, with a relationship established between
  them (e.g., through an object property such as hasProteinContent) to indicate that
  a particular juice instance has a certain protein value associated with it.'
