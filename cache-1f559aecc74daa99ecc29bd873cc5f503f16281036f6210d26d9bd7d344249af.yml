  The two instances, "Red bell pepper, sliced" and "Sliced green onions," are not
  identical in their composition or nutritional content, even though they share some
  similarities in form (i.e., both being sliced). They belong to different vegetable
  categories and have distinct flavors, textures, and nutrient profiles. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate rather than merging them as duplicates.'
