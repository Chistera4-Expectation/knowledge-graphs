  While both Adobo seasoning and Optional seasonings may seem similar, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. Adobo seasoning refers to a specific blend of
  herbs and spices commonly used in certain cuisines, while Optional seasonings refer
  to any additional seasonings that can be added based on personal preference. Therefore,
  it is important to keep them separate to maintain clarity and accuracy in classification.'
