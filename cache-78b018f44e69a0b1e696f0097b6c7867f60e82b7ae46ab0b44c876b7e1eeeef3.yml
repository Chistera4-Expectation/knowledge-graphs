text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. Although they are both types of bell
  peppers, they have different colors and nutritional profiles. For example, yellow
  bell peppers generally have slightly higher levels of Vitamin C than red or green
  bell peppers. Merging them together would not accurately represent the distinct
  characteristics of each type of pepper.
