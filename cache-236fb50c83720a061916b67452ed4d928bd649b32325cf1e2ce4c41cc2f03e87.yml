  Breadcrumbs and gluten-free bread are two different types of bread products with
  distinct characteristics and purposes. Breadcrumbs are small pieces of bread that
  have been dried out and ground up into crumbs, often used as a topping for soups,
  salads, pasta dishes, and other foods. Gluten-free bread, on the other hand, is
  made from ingredients that do not contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley,
  and rye, and is designed for individuals who have celiac disease or prefer a gluten-free
  diet. These two types of bread products have different textures, tastes, and nutritional
  profiles, making them separate entities rather than duplicates.'
