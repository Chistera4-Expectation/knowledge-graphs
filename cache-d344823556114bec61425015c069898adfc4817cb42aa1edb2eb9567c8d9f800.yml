text: No, Blueberry Honey and Clover Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are different types of honey with distinct flavors and characteristics
  derived from the nectar of the respective plants (blueberry flowers and clover flowers)
  from which the bees collect nectar to produce the honey. While they share the commonality
  of being honey, they are not the same and should be classified as separate entities.
