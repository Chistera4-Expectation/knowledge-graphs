text: No, they should not be merged together. While both chicken wings and pheasant
  wings are poultry-derived foods, they are different species and may have different
  nutritional values, cooking methods, and cultural significance. Therefore, they
  should be treated as distinct instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
