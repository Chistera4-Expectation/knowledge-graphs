  While both coconut oil and cottonseed oil are types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have different nutritional profiles, sources, and uses. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Coconut oil is extracted from the meat of mature coconuts and has a high saturated
  fat content (around 90%). It also contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which
  may provide some health benefits such as improved cognitive function and weight
  loss. Coconut oil is commonly used for cooking and baking due to its high smoke
  point and mild flavor.


  On the other hand, cottonseed oil is obtained from the seeds of cotton plants and
  has a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fats compared to coconut oil (around
  52%). Cottonseed oil is often used as a salad dressing or for frying due to its
  light texture and neutral taste. However, there have been concerns about the potential
  presence of pesticide residues in cottonseed oil due to the widespread use of pesticides
  in cotton farming.


  Therefore, while coconut oil and cottonseed oil are both edible vegetable oils,
  they differ in their composition, properties, and applications. Hence, they should
  not be considered as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
