text: "As a dietician, I can provide an informed perspective on this topic. However,\
  \ the decision ultimately depends on the specific context and purpose of the Tea\
  \ class. \n\nBlack tea and infused tea are not semantic and ontologic duplicates,\
  \ as they differ in terms of processing, flavor, and potential health benefits.\
  \ Black tea undergoes a fermentation process, while infused teas usually involve\
  \ steeping herbs, fruits, or spices in hot water.\n\nIf the Tea class is meant to\
  \ represent a comprehensive list of tea types, it would be appropriate to have separate\
  \ instances for Black Tea and Infused Tea. If, however, the class is focused specifically\
  \ on tea types that involve fermentation, then it might be more appropriate to merge\
  \ Black Tea with other fermented teas and keep Infused Tea as a separate instance.\n\
  \nIn conclusion, the answer depends on the context and purpose of the Tea class."
