text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates because they
  have distinct properties and characteristics. Gluten-Free Bread is made without
  gluten, while Sourdough Bread contains gluten. These differences in ingredients
  and preparation methods would make it inaccurate to merge them as the same entity.
