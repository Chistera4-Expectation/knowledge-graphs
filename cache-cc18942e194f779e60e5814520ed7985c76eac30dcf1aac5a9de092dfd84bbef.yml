text: "As a dietician, my primary focus is on nutrition and health, not specifically\
  \ on the technical aspects of ontology or semantics. However, from a nutritional\
  \ and dietary perspective, camel milk and regular milk are not identical. They have\
  \ different nutritional compositions, and some people may have allergies or intolerances\
  \ to one type of milk but not the other. Therefore, from a practical standpoint,\
  \ it would be beneficial to keep them as separate instances within the Milk class.\
  \ \n\nThat being said, if you're referring to a specific ontological model or knowledge\
  \ base, the decision to merge or keep them separate would depend on the purpose\
  \ and design of that model."
