text: ' No. Catfish fillets and raw fish are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While catfish is a type of edible fish, not all raw fish are catfish fillets. They
  belong to the same broader category (edible fish), but they have distinct properties
  and uses. Therefore, they should not be merged together.'
