  While "diced onions" refers to a specific preparation of an onion (i.e., chopped
  into small cubes), "yellow onion" is a type of onion that varies from other types
  such as white, red, or sweet onions based on its flavor profile and color. Therefore,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates but rather different concepts related
  to the broader category of edible vegetables.'
