text: No, the instances 'Horseshoe Crab' and 'Sand Crab' should not be merged together
  as they belong to different taxonomic groups. Horseshoe crabs are part of the class
  Merostomata, while sand crabs belong to the class Malacostraca. Although they are
  both crustaceans, their classification and characteristics are distinct.
