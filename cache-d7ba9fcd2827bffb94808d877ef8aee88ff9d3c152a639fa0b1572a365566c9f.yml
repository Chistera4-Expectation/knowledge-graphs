text: No, Black Tea and Earl Grey Tea should not be merged as they are different types
  of tea. Earl Grey Tea is a type of black tea that is flavored with bergamot oil,
  while Black Tea refers to a broader category of tea that is fully oxidized and includes
  various types and flavors, such as Assam, Darjeeling, and Ceylon. Although they
  share some similarities, they are distinct and should not be merged as duplicates.
