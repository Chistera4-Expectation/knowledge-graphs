text: As a dietician, I would advise that these two sauces should not be merged together
  as they have distinct differences in flavor, ingredients, and uses. Teriyaki sauce
  is typically a sweet and salty sauce made from soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and sometimes
  ginger, while sour sauce is typically a tangy sauce made from vinegar, sugar, and
  other flavorings. Although they may have overlapping uses, they serve different
  purposes in cooking and have unique flavor profiles.
