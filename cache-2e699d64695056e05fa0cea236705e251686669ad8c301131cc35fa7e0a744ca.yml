text: As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on the nutritional aspects of these
  bread types, but I am not an expert in semantics or ontology. However, I can say
  that 'French Bread' and 'Soda Bread' are different types of bread with unique ingredients,
  preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, from a dietary perspective,
  they should not be merged together as duplicates.
