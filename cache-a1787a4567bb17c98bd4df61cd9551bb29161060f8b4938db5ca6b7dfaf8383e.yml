  While both "Fresh mozzarella cheese" and "Mascarpone cheese" are types of Italian
  cheese made from cow''s milk, they have different textures, flavors, and uses in
  cooking. Fresh mozzarella is a soft, white cheese with a mild flavor and a spongy
  texture, often used on pizzas and in salads. Mascarpone, on the other hand, is a
  rich, creamy cheese with a tangy, slightly sweet flavor, often used in desserts
  like tiramisu and cannoli. They are distinct products with their own unique characteristics,
  so they should not be merged as duplicates.'
