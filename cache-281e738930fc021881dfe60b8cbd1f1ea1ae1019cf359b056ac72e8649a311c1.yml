text: No, the instances 'Peach juice' and 'Strawberry juice' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are two distinct types of
  juice with different flavors, ingredients, and nutritional profiles. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the individual characteristics of each juice type.
