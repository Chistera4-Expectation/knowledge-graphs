text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although they are both types of onions, they have distinct characteristics in terms
  of flavor, appearance, and culinary uses. Red onions are milder in flavor and have
  a vibrant purple color, while yellow or white onions have a stronger flavor and
  are often used in cooking for their sweetness. Therefore, they should be considered
  separate instances within the Edible Vegetable class.
