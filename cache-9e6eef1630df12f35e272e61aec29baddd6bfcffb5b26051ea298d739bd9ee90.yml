  While both ground pork and roasted pork are types of pork, they have different preparation
  methods and characteristics that make them distinct from each other. Ground pork
  is made by grinding raw pork into small pieces, often used for making dishes like
  meatballs, sausages, or stir-fries. On the other hand, roasted pork involves cooking
  a whole piece of pork (like a pork loin or pork belly) at high heat, typically uncovered,
  to create a well-browned exterior and tender interior. Merging these two concepts
  would not accurately represent their unique culinary uses and properties.'
