text: No, Black Rice and Jasmine Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics,
  nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Black Rice is known for its high antioxidant
  content, while Jasmine Rice is prized for its fragrant aroma and slightly sticky
  texture. Merging them would result in a loss of valuable information about each
  type of rice.
