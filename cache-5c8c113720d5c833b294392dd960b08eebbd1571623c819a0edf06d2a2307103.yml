text: No, Greek Yogurt and Kefir Yogurt should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of yogurt, they have distinct
  characteristics, nutritional profiles, and fermentation processes. Greek Yogurt
  is strained to remove the whey, resulting in a thicker consistency and higher protein
  content. Kefir Yogurt is fermented using kefir grains and contains probiotics, making
  it beneficial for gut health. They are different enough to warrant separate classifications.
