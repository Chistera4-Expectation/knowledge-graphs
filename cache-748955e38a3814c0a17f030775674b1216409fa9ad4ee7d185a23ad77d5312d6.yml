text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of cheese with different
  nutritional profiles and uses. Cottage cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are
  different in taste, texture, and nutritional content, and therefore should be treated
  as separate instances within the Cheese class.
