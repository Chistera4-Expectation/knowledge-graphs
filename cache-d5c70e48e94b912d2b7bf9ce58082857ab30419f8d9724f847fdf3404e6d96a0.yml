text: No, the instances 'Lassi Yogurt' and 'Whole Milk Yogurt' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both are types of yogurt,
  they have distinct properties, such as different ingredients, textures, and nutritional
  profiles. Lassi Yogurt is typically made with yogurt, water, and various flavorings,
  while Whole Milk Yogurt is made with whole milk. They should be kept as separate
  instances in the Yogurt class.
