text: ' No. While "Lemon wedges" could be considered a type of edible fruit, it is
  not a duplicate for the attribute "name - the common name of the food item." The
  common name of this food item is still "lemon," but its form or preparation might
  be described as "wedges." Therefore, these two attributes provide different information
  and should not be merged as duplicates.'
