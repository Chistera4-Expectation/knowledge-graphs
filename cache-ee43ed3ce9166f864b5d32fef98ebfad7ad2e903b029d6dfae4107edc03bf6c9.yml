text: No, they should not be merged together as they are not semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of chili, Kashmiri chili powder and red chili flakes
  have distinct characteristics, such as color, heat level, and usage. Therefore,
  they should remain as separate instances in the Spice class.
