  While onion powder and bouillon powder are both types of food seasonings, they have
  different ingredients, uses, and flavors. Onion powder is made from dehydrated onions
  and has a strong onion flavor, while bouillon powder typically contains meat or
  vegetable stock, vegetables, herbs, spices, and sometimes MSG, providing a more
  complex and savory taste. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two concepts as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
