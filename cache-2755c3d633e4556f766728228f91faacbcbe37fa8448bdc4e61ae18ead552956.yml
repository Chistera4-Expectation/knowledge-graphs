text: No, 'Darjeeling Tea' and 'Lavender Tea' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates because they are distinct types of tea with different flavor
  profiles, origins, and possibly health benefits. While they may both belong to the
  same 'Tea' class, they are unique instances within that class.
