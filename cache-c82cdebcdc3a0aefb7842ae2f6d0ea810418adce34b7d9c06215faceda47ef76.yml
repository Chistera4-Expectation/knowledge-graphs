text: No, they should not be merged as they have different nutritional profiles and
  cooking methods. Boneless chicken typically refers to chicken breast or thigh meat
  without the bone, while chicken wings are a specific part of the chicken that includes
  the bone, skin, and meat. These differences impact the nutritional content and cooking
  methods, making them distinct instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
