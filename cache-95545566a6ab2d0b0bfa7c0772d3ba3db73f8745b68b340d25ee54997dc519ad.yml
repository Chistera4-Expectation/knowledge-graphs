  Cantaloupe seeds and flaxseeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates. While
  both are types of seeds, they come from different plants (cantaloupes vs. flax)
  and have distinct nutritional profiles. Merging them would result in loss of important
  distinctions between these two food items.'
