text: No, Avocado Oil and Chili Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different
  properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Avocado Oil is derived from the fruit
  of the avocado tree and is high in monounsaturated fats, while Chili Oil is made
  from chili peppers and contains a high concentration of capsaicin, which provides
  its spicy flavor.
