text: ' No. Cottonseed oil and walnut oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While they both fall under the category of edible
  vegetable oils, they come from different sources (cottonseeds vs. walnuts) and have
  distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important
  to maintain them as separate entries in an edible vegetable oil classification system.'
