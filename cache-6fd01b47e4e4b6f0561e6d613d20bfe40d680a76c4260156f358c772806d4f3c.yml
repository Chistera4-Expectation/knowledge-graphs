text: No, the 'Chanterelle Mushroom' and 'Chicken of the Woods Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as they are different types of edible mushrooms with distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and uses in cooking. Merging them would result in loss
  of specific information about each mushroom species.
