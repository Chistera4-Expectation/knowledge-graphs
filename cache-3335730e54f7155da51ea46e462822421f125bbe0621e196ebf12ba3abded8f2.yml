text: No, they should not be merged together. While both instances may be considered
  vegetables, they are different types of vegetables and serve different purposes
  in a recipe or diet. 'Vegetables of your choice' is a general category that allows
  for a variety of options, whereas 'other chili pepper' is a specific type of vegetable
  that adds heat and spice to a dish. Merging them would result in a loss of specificity
  and could lead to confusion in recipe instructions or dietary recommendations.
