  Although both "chicken breast" and "low-sodium chicken broth" are poultry-derived
  foods, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and physical properties. Chicken breast is
  a lean source of protein that can be cooked in various ways, while low-sodium chicken
  broth is a liquid made from simmering chicken bones and vegetables, which has lower
  sodium content than regular chicken broth. Therefore, these two food items serve
  distinct purposes in a healthy and balanced diet.'
