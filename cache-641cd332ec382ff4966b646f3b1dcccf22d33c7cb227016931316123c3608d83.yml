text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both "Guinea Fowl Meatballs" and "Guinea Fowl Patties" are derived from guinea fowl,
  they represent different food preparations with distinct shapes and cooking methods.
  Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
