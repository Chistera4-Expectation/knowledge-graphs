text: ' The most adequate class for "Chives" would be "Edible Vegetables." Chives
  are herbs that belong to the onion family and are used as a flavoring agent in various
  dishes. They have numerous health benefits, including being rich in vitamins A,
  C, and K, as well as antioxidants. Therefore, grouping chives with other edible
  vegetables is the most appropriate classification based on their nutritional content
  and culinary usage.'
