text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of peppers,
  they have distinct characteristics and uses in culinary and dietary contexts. Dried
  Cameroon Pepper and Scotch Bonnet Pepper are different species with unique flavor
  profiles and heat levels. Merging them would result in a loss of specific information
  and would not accurately represent the differences between the two.
