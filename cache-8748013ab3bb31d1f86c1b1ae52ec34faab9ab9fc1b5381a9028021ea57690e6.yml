text: No, the instances 'Lavender Tea' and 'White Tea' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are distinct types of tea with different
  flavor profiles, ingredients, and brewing methods. While they both fall under the
  broader category of tea, they are not semantically or ontologically equivalent.
