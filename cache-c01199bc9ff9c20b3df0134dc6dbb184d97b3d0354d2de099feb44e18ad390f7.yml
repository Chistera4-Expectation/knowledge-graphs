  Although both black pepper and chili pepper are types of spices, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they have distinct taste, flavor, origin, and
  uses in cooking. Black pepper is made from dried and ground peppercorns and has
  a milder heat with earthy undertones, while chili peppers come in various species
  (such as cayenne or jalapeno) that offer varying levels of pungency and fruity to
  smoky flavors. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions between
  these two popular spices.'
