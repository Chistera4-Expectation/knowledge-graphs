text: No, "Ostrich Meatballs" and "Ostrich Soup" should not be merged as they are
  distinct food items with different preparation methods and dish structures. While
  they both contain ostrich meat, they have different characteristics and should be
  treated as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
