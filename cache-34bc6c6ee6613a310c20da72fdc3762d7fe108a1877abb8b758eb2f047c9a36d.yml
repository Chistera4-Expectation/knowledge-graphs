text: No, Chicken Liver and Duck Liver should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the Poultry-derived Food class,
  they are distinct types of poultry liver with different nutritional profiles and
  characteristics. Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and accuracy
  in categorization.
