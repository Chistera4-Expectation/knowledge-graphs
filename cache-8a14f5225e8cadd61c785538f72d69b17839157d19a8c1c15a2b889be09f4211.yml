text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Australian
  Yogurt and Drinkable Yogurt are different types of yogurt with distinct characteristics.
  Australian Yogurt refers to yogurt originating from Australia, while Drinkable Yogurt
  refers to yogurt that is designed to be consumed as a beverage. Although both are
  types of yogurt, they have distinct attributes and should not be merged as duplicates.
