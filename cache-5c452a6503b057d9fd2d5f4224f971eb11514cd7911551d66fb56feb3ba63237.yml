text: No, Red Rice and Short-grain Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different types of rice with distinct characteristics,
  such as color and grain size. Red Rice is typically a whole grain rice with a reddish
  color, while Short-grain Rice has a shorter and rounder grain shape. These differences
  make them unique and not duplicates.
