text: No, 'Lemon Tea' and 'Mint Tea' should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they both belong to the Tea class, they are distinct
  types of tea with different flavors and ingredients. Merging them would not accurately
  represent their unique characteristics.
