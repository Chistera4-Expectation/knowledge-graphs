text: 'No, the instances ''Fat-Free Yogurt'' and ''Lassi Yogurt'' should not be merged
  together as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types
  of yogurt with distinct characteristics: Fat-Free Yogurt is yogurt with no fat content,
  while Lassi Yogurt is a drink made from yogurt, water, and various flavorings. Although
  both are types of yogurt, they have different properties and uses.'
