text: ' No. While both "Protein per serving" and "serving size of the cheese" provide
  information about a serving of cheese, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  The protein content is a measure of nutritional value, while the serving size describes
  the quantity being measured. Merging them would not accurately reflect their distinct
  roles in describing a cheese product.'
