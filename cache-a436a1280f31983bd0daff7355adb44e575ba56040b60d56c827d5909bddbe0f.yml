text: No, they should not be merged. Although they both fall under the category of
  drinking water, they serve different purposes. Spring Water is a type of bottled
  drinking water, while Water for egg wash is used in culinary applications as a liquid
  to help adhere breadcrumbs or other coatings to food items. They are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates.
