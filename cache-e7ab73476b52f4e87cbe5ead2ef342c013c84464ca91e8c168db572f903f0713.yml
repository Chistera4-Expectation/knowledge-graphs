  While both "Duck Patties" and "Duck" are poultry-derived foods, they are not the
  same thing. "Duck" refers to the entire animal, whereas "Duck Patties" are a specific
  preparation of duck meat, typically formed into a patty shape. They have different
  nutritional profiles and cooking methods, and therefore should be treated as separate
  entities in the Poultry-derived Food class.
