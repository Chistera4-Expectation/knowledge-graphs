  While both Chicken Caesar Salad and Chicken Tacos contain chicken and can therefore
  be considered poultry-derived foods, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates.
  They have different ingredients (for example, lettuce, croutons, and dressing for
  the salad; tortillas, salsa, and cheese for the tacos), cooking methods, cultural
  origins, and uses in cuisine. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them
  as such.'
