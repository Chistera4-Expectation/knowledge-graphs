text: No, 'Pheasant Stock' and 'Pheasant Thighs' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct poultry-derived food items
  with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Pheasant Stock refers to
  the liquid made by simmering pheasant bones, meat, and vegetables, while Pheasant
  Thighs are a specific cut of poultry meat.
