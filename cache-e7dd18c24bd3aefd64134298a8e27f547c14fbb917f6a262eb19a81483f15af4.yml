text: 'No, "Forbidden Rice" and "Japonica Rice" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct properties
  and characteristics.


  "Forbidden Rice," also known as black rice, is a variety of rice that has a dark
  purple color and a nutty flavor. It is rich in antioxidants, fiber, and other nutrients,
  and is often considered a "superfood."


  "Japonica Rice," on the other hand, is a short-grain rice variety that is commonly
  grown in Japan and other parts of Asia. It is characterized by its sticky texture
  and is often used in dishes such as sushi and risotto.


  Although both are types of rice, the differences in their appearance, taste, and
  nutritional content make them distinct entities in the context of a rice class.'
