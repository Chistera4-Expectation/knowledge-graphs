text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they are both types of butter,
  'Plant-based Butter' and 'Whipped Butter' have distinct differences in their ingredients
  and properties. Plant-based butter is made from plant-based ingredients, while whipped
  butter is made from traditional butter and has been whipped to incorporate air,
  making it lighter and fluffier. These differences make them separate and unique
  instances within the Butter class.
