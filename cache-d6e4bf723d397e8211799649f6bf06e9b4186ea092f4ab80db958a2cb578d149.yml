  While chicken breast and chicken soup both come from chickens and can be classified
  under the broader category of poultry-derived foods, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Chicken breast is a specific cut of meat with its own nutritional profile,
  while chicken soup is a prepared dish that typically includes chicken breast along
  with other ingredients like vegetables and broth. Merging these two instances would
  result in loss of important distinctions between them.'
