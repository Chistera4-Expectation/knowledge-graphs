text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. Although both 'Papaya juice' and 'Strawberry
  juice' are juices, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different
  types of juices with distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses. Merging them
  together would not accurately represent the variety and differences in juices.
