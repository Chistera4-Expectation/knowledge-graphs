  In the context of a Pork-derived Food class, "Ground pork" and "Pork belly" are
  not semantic and ontological duplicates. They refer to different types of pork products
  with distinct textures, flavors, and culinary uses. Ground pork is a processed product
  made from ground meat, while pork belly is a cut of meat that comes from the belly
  of the pig. These differences make them separate entities in the class hierarchy.
  Therefore, they should not be merged as duplicates.'
