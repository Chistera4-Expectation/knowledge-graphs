text: ' No. Chopped onions and green onions are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both fall under the category of "vegetables" and can be used in similar culinary
  contexts (e.g., cooking), they refer to different plant species: chopped onions
  typically come from Allium cepa (common onion) while green onions belong to the
  Allium fistulosum family (also known as Welsh onion). Merging them would lead to
  incorrect categorization and usage information for each instance.'
