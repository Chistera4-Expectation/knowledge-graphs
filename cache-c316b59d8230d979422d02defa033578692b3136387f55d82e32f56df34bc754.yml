text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of yogurt, "Creamy
  Yogurt" typically refers to dairy yogurt with a rich and smooth texture, while "Non-Dairy
  Yogurt" refers to yogurt made from plant-based alternatives, such as soy or almond
  milk, and does not contain any dairy products. These two types of yogurt serve different
  dietary preferences and needs, and therefore should not be considered semantic or
  ontologic duplicates.
