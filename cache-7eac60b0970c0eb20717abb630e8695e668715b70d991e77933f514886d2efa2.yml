text: No, Turkey Tenders and Turkey Thighs should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from turkey meat, they have
  distinct characteristics in terms of texture, taste, and nutritional content, making
  them unique instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
