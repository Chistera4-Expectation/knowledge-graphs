text: As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspects of these
  honeys. However, whether to merge the instances 'Dandelion Honey' and 'Sage Honey'
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates is a decision that depends on the specific
  context and purpose of the classification system. If the classification system focuses
  on the nutritional content and health benefits, it might be appropriate to merge
  them as they are both types of honey. But if the classification system focuses on
  the specific plant source, it would be more appropriate to keep them separate. Therefore,
  a simple yes or no answer is not sufficient to address this question.
