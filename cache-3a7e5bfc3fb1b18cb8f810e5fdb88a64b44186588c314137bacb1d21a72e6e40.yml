text: As a dietician, my answer is no. Although both Guinea Fowl Patties and Quail
  Patties are poultry-derived foods, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  They are distinct types of poultry and can have different nutritional profiles,
  preparation methods, and cultural significance. Therefore, they should be treated
  as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
