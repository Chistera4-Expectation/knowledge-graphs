text: As a dietician, I would recommend against merging the instances 'Vegetable'
  and 'Vegetables of your choice' together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they may seem similar, they serve different purposes in describing the variety
  of vegetables. 'Vegetable' is a general term, while 'Vegetables of your choice'
  allows for a more personalized selection of vegetables. Merging them would result
  in a loss of specificity and flexibility in describing various vegetable options.
