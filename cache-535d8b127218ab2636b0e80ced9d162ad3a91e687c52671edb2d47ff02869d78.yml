text: No, Lobster and Slipper Lobster should not be merged as they are different species
  with distinct characteristics, even though they belong to the Edible Crustaceans
  class. Lobster is a member of the Nephropidae family, while Slipper Lobster belongs
  to the Scyllaridae family. They have different morphological features and habitat
  preferences. Although they share some similarities, they are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
