text: No, Raspberry and Strawberry should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they both belong to the Edible Fruit class, they are distinct
  fruits with different characteristics, flavors, and nutritional profiles. Merging
  them would lose the specific information about each fruit and limit the ability
  to provide accurate dietary advice.
