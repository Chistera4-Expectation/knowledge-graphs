text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of pork-derived food
  with different properties and uses. Ground pork is finely chopped or minced pork,
  while pork belly is a cut of meat from the belly of the pig. These two items should
  be kept as separate instances in the Pork-derived Food class.
