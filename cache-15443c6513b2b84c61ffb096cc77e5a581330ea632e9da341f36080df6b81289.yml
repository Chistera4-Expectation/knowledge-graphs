text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different food products made
  from ostrich meat. Ostrich Gravy is a sauce made from ostrich meat, while Ostrich
  Sausage is a processed meat product made from ground ostrich meat. They may share
  the same protein source, but their preparation and usage are distinct.
