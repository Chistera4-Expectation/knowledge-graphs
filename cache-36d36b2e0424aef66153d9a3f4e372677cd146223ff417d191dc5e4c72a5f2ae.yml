text: No, Coconut Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both edible vegetal oils, they have distinct properties,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Coconut Oil is extracted from the kernel or meat
  of mature coconuts, while Wheat Germ Oil is extracted from the germ of wheat kernels.
  These differences make them separate entities in the context of dietetics and nutrition.
