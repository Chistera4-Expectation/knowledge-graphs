text: ' No. Linden honey and raw wildflower honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They have
  different taste, color, texture, and nutritional properties due to their unique
  plant sources and processing methods. Therefore, it is important to keep them separate
  for accurate classification and information retrieval purposes.'
