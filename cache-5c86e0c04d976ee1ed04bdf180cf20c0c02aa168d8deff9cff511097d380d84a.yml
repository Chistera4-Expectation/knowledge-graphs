text: ' No. While both "fiber per serving" and "serving size of the cheese" are related
  to nutrition and portion control, they serve different purposes and measure distinct
  aspects of food consumption. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.


  1. Fiber per serving: This refers to the amount of dietary fiber present in one
  recommended serving of the cheese. Dietary fiber has various health benefits, such
  as promoting digestive health and helping maintain stable blood sugar levels. It
  is essential to understand how much fiber a particular type or brand of cheese provides
  for proper nutritional planning.

  2. Serving size of the cheese: The serving size indicates the quantity of cheese
  that constitutes a single serving, which may vary depending on the specific product
  and its nutrient content. Knowledge about serving sizes helps individuals monitor
  their caloric intake and make informed decisions regarding portion control when
  consuming dairy products like cheese.


  By keeping these two pieces of information separate but closely linked, consumers
  can better assess the overall quality of their diets while understanding the contribution
  of each item within reasonable limits.'
