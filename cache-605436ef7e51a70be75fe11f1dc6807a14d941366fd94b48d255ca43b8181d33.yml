  While both "Grain-finished beef" and "beef back ribs" are types of beef products,
  they refer to different cuts and preparation methods. Grain-finished beef refers
  to cattle that have been fed grains during the finishing phase of their growth,
  resulting in specific marbling and flavor characteristics. On the other hand, beef
  back ribs are a particular cut from the animal, specifically the part of the ribcage
  between the chuck and loin sections. Therefore, these two terms cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates because they represent distinct concepts within
  the domain of beef production and consumption.'
