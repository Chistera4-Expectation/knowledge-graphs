text: ' No. Oyster sauce and tomato sauce are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  because they have different ingredients, flavors, appearances, uses, and origins.
  Oyster sauce is made from oysters, while tomato sauce is derived from tomatoes.
  They serve distinct purposes in cooking and contribute unique tastes to dishes.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
