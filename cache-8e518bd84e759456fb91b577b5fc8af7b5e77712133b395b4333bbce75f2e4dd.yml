text: As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspects of the
  drinks, but the decision to merge or not merge instances in a class would typically
  be made by a software engineer or data modeler. However, from a nutritional standpoint,
  the 'Apple Clove Infusion' and 'Orange Cinnamon Infusion' are different drinks with
  distinct flavors and potentially different nutritional profiles. They may share
  some commonalities as infusion drinks, but they are not exact duplicates. So, based
  on my understanding, the answer is no, they should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates.
