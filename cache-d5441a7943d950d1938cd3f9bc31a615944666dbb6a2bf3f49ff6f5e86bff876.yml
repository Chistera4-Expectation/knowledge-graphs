  While both carbohydrates and total fat are types of nutrients found in cheese (and
  other foods), they serve different functions and have different impacts on health.
  Carbohydrates provide energy to the body, while fat provides energy and supports
  various bodily functions such as vitamin absorption and hormone production. Therefore,
  it is important to track both separately rather than merging them into one category.'
