text: No, "Sheep's Milk" and "Soy Milk" should not be merged together as they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates. They are two different types of milk with
  distinct origins, nutritional profiles, and uses. "Sheep's Milk" is an animal-based
  milk from sheep, while "Soy Milk" is a plant-based milk derived from soybeans. These
  differences make them separate entities in a milk classification system.
