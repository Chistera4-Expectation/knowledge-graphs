text: No, they should not be merged. While both are types of edible vegetable oils,
  they have distinct properties and uses. Cooking oil is a general term for various
  types of oils used in cooking, while Rice Bran Oil is a specific type of cooking
  oil extracted from the bran or outer husk of rice.
