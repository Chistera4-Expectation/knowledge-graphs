text: No, Peanut Oil and Sesame Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates because they are distinct types of edible vegetal oils with different
  nutritional profiles, flavor profiles, and uses in cooking. While they both have
  a nutty aroma, their chemical compositions, nutrient content, and culinary applications
  differ.
