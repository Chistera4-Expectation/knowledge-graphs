  While both barbecue sauce and fish sauce are types of sauces, they serve different
  purposes and have unique ingredients. Barbecue sauce is typically used as a condiment
  for grilled or barbecued meats and has a sweet and tangy flavor profile with ingredients
  such as tomatoes, vinegar, sugar, and various spices. On the other hand, fish sauce
  is a pungent, savory liquid made from fermented fish that is commonly used in Asian
  cuisine to add depth of flavor to dishes like soups, stir-fries, and dipping sauces.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two distinct food items as
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
