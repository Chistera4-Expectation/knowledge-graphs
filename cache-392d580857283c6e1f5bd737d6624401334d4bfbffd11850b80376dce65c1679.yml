text: No, the instances 'Australian Yogurt' and 'Frozen Yogurt' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of yogurt
  based on their origin and processing methods. Australian Yogurt refers to yogurt
  made in Australia, while Frozen Yogurt is a type of yogurt that has been frozen
  and often has added toppings or mix-ins. They are distinct categories within the
  yogurt class.
