text: No, Castor Oil and Rice Bran Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have different
  chemical compositions, properties, and uses. Castor Oil is derived from the seeds
  of the castor oil plant (Ricinus communis) and is primarily used in industrial applications,
  while Rice Bran Oil is extracted from the bran or outer layer of rice grains and
  is used for cooking and as a dietary supplement.
