text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Broccoli' and 'Steamed broccoli'
  are related, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Broccoli' refers to
  the vegetable itself, while 'Steamed broccoli' refers to a specific preparation
  method for the vegetable. They are distinct concepts in terms of their semantics
  and ontology.
