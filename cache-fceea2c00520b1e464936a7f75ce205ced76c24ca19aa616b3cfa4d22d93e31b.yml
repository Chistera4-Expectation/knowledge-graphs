text: 'No, these instances should not be merged together. While both relate to cheese,
  they serve different purposes and provide distinct information. ''Blue Cheese''
  represents a specific type of cheese, while ''Optional: additional cheese for topping''
  is a suggestion for adding more cheese as a topping. These concepts are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.'
