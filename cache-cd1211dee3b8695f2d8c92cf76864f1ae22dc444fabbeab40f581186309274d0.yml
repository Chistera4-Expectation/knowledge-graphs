  While both "Fish sauce" and "Hot sauce" are types of sauces, they serve different
  purposes and have distinct ingredients. Fish sauce is typically made from fermented
  fish or fish paste, while hot sauce is usually made from chili peppers and vinegar.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
