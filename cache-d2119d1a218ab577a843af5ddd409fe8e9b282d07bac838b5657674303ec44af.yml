text: No, they should not be merged together. Rice milk and sheep's milk are different
  types of milk, with distinct nutritional profiles and origins. Rice milk is a plant-based
  milk alternative made from rice, while sheep's milk is an animal-based milk derived
  from sheep. They serve different dietary needs and preferences and should be considered
  separate entities in the Milk class.
