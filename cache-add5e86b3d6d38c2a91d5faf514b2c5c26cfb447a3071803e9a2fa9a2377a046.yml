text: No, Catfish and Fish stock should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While Catfish is a type of edible fish, Fish stock is a cooking ingredient
  made by simmering fish bones, trimmings, and other aromatics. They have distinct
  characteristics and uses, so they should be kept as separate instances.
