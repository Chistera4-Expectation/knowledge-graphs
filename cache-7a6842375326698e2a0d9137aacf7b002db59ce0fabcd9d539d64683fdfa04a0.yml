text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they
  both are derived from ostrich, they are different types of food products with distinct
  uses and preparation methods. Ostrich gravy is typically a sauce made from the drippings
  of cooked ostrich meat, whereas ostrich nuggets are bite-sized pieces of ostrich
  meat, often breaded and fried. These differences in form and preparation make them
  distinct entities within the Poultry-derived Food class.
