text: No, the instances 'Horseshoe Crab' and 'Rock Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different species and do not belong
  to the same class of edible crustaceans. Horseshoe Crabs are not even true crabs,
  belonging to a separate class called Merostomata, while Rock Crabs are true crabs,
  belonging to the class Crustacea and the order Decapoda.
