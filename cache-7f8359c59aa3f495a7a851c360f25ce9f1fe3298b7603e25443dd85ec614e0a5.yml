text: ' No. While both "Honey" and "Raw Wildflower Honey" are types of honey, they
  have distinct differences that warrant them to not be considered semantic or ontological
  duplicates. "Honey" is a broad term used to describe a sweet substance produced
  by bees from the nectar of flowers, while "Raw Wildflower Honey" refers to a specific
  type of unprocessed honey made from the nectar of various wildflowers. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances together.'
