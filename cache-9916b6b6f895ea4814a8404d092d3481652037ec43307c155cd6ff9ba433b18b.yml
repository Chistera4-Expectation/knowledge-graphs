text: As a dietician, my answer is no. Herbal Tea and Lemon Tea are not semantic or
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of tea, they have different ingredients
  and properties. Herbal tea typically refers to any tea made from the infusion of
  herbs, spices, or other plant materials, while Lemon Tea is specifically made with
  lemon as a primary ingredient. Merging them together would not accurately represent
  their unique characteristics.
