text: No, they should not be merged. While both Acacia Honey and Raw Honey are types
  of honey, they have distinct properties and characteristics. Acacia Honey is a specific
  type of honey derived from the nectar of the Acacia tree, while Raw Honey is unprocessed
  and unfiltered honey in its purest form. Although they are both forms of honey,
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
