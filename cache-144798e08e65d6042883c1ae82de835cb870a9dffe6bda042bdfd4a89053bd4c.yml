text: 'As a dietician, my primary focus is on nutrition and health, not on computer
  science or programming. However, I can provide some guidance based on the context.


  From a dietary perspective, ''Coffee'' and ''Vienna Coffee'' are not duplicates,
  as they refer to different types of coffee with distinct ingredients and preparation
  methods. ''Coffee'' generally refers to a beverage made from roasted coffee beans,
  while ''Vienna Coffee'' is a specific type of coffee that includes two shots of
  espresso and whipped cream.


  Regarding the Coffee class in programming, I would need more information to determine
  if the instances ''Coffee'' and ''Vienna Coffee'' should be merged or not. It depends
  on the context and purpose of the class and the overall design of the program. If
  the class is designed to represent different types of coffee and their properties,
  then it may make sense to keep them as separate instances. However, if the class
  is intended to represent a single type of coffee and its variations, then merging
  them might be appropriate. Ultimately, the decision should be based on the program''s
  requirements and the developer''s design choices.'
