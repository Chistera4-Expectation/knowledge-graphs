  While both "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Chicken Pieces" contain chicken, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates because they represent different food items
  with distinct ingredients and preparations. A serving of "Chicken Caesar Salad"
  typically consists of chopped romaine lettuce, croutons, parmesan cheese, dressing,
  and cooked chicken, while "Chicken Pieces" can refer to various cuts (e.g., breasts,
  thighs) served without any additional components or preparation. Merging these two
  instances would not accurately reflect their unique culinary identities.'
