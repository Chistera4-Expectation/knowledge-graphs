text: ' No. Although both Alfalfa honey and Raw Wildflower honey fall under the category
  of "honey," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct
  characteristics and origins that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it
  is appropriate to keep these two types of honey separate.'
