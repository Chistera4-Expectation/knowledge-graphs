text: ' No. Canned tuna and fresh/frozen tuna are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  even though they both belong to the same general category of "edible fish." They
  have different nutritional profiles due to processing methods (e.g., canned tuna
  may contain added salt), varying mercury levels depending on the type of tuna used,
  and distinct uses in recipes. Keeping them separate allows for more accurate tracking
  and comparison of their respective health benefits and drawbacks.'
