text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both 'Guinea Fowl Wings' and 'Quail Wings' are derived from poultry, they are distinct
  species with different nutritional profiles, flavors, and textures. Therefore, it
  is essential to keep them separate in a dietician's classification system.
