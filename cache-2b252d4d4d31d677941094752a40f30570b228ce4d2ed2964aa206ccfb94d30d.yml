text: No, they should not be merged together. Non-Dairy Yogurt and Skyr Yogurt are
  different types of yogurt with distinct characteristics and ingredients. Non-Dairy
  Yogurt is made from non-dairy milk alternatives, while Skyr Yogurt is a type of
  Icelandic yogurt made from cow's milk. They should remain separate instances in
  the Yogurt class.
