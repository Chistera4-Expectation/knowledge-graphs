text: ' No. While both Russian Dressing and Yogurt Dressing are types of dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients and characteristics. Russian Dressing is typically
  made with mayonnaise, ketchup, chili sauce, wine vinegar, onion, and other seasonings.
  Yogurt Dressing, on the other hand, is usually made with yogurt, oil, vinegar or
  lemon juice, garlic, herbs, and spices. They serve different culinary purposes and
  cannot be considered semantic or ontologic duplicates.'
