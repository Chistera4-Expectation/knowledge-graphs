text: 'No, the instances ''Duck Drumsticks'' and ''Duck'' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are related, they represent
  different parts of the duck: ''Duck Drumsticks'' refers to a specific cut of meat
  from a duck, while ''Duck'' refers to the entire bird.'
