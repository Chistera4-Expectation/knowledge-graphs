text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are derived from poultry
  (pheasant), they are different food products with distinct culinary preparations
  and nutritional profiles. Pheasant sausage is a processed meat product, while pheasant
  wings are a specific cut of meat from the pheasant. These differences warrant separate
  instances in a Poultry-derived Food class.
