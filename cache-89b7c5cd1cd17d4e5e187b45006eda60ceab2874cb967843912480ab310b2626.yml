text: As a dietician, my answer is that 'Cremini Mushroom' and 'Mushrooms' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While cremini mushrooms
  are a specific type of mushroom, the broader term 'Mushrooms' encompasses a wide
  variety of fungi species. By keeping these two instances separate, we can provide
  more accurate and specific information about each type of mushroom.
