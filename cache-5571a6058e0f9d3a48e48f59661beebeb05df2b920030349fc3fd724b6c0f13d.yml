text: ' The most adequate class for antioxidants would be "Food." Antioxidants can
  be found in various food groups, and restricting the search to specific categories
  like dressings, seasonings, sauces, spices, or sweeteners may limit the options
  unnecessarily. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, and even
  some animal-based foods (like fish and eggs) contain antioxidants. It is essential
  to have an overall balanced and nutritious diet that includes these antioxidant-rich
  foods rather than focusing on just one category.'
