  While both "chicken salad" and "rotisserie chicken" are poultry-derived foods, they
  have distinct differences in terms of their preparation, nutritional content, and
  usage. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.


  A rotisserie chicken is typically a whole chicken that has been seasoned and cooked
  on a spit over an open flame or in an oven. It can be served as a main dish with
  various sides, shredded for sandwiches, tacos, or salads, or used in recipes that
  call for cooked chicken. Rotisserie chickens often contain added salt, oils, and
  other ingredients depending on the specific recipe and cooking method.


  On the other hand, chicken salad usually consists of chopped or shredded cooked
  chicken combined with mayonnaise, celery, onions, and sometimes additional ingredients
  like grapes, almonds, or herbs. Chicken salad is often prepared as a cold dish and
  can be eaten on its own, used as a sandwich filling, or served alongside crackers
  or fresh vegetables. The nutritional content varies widely based on the ingredients
  included in each recipe.


  Given these distinctions, I would recommend keeping "chicken salad" and "rotisserie
  chicken" as separate entities within your Poultry-derived Food class.'
