text: No, the instances 'Assam Tea' and 'Infused Tea' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of tea, they
  have distinct characteristics and properties. Assam tea is a specific variety of
  black tea grown in the Assam region of India, while infused tea refers to any tea
  that has been steeped in water to extract its flavor and nutrients, and can include
  various types of tea (e.g., black, green, white, herbal). Therefore, they should
  be treated as separate instances within the Tea class.
