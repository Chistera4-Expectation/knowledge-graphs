text: ' No. Bean sprouts and sprouts are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they may seem similar at first glance. Sprouts can refer to any edible
  germinated seed, while bean sprouts specifically refer to the shoots of beans such
  as mung beans. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between the two terms due
  to their different nutritional profiles, growth processes, and potential uses in
  cooking.'
