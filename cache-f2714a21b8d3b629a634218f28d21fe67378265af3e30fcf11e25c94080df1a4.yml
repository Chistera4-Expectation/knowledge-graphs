  Although both are types of honey, they have distinct characteristics and come from
  different plant sources, which make them unique in terms of flavor, texture, and
  nutritional content. Clover honey is derived from the nectar of clover flowers,
  while sage honey comes from the nectar of sage flowers. Merging them together would
  disregard these distinctions.
