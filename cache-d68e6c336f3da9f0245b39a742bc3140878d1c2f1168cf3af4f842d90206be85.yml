  While "diced onion" is a specific form of preparation for an onion, it does not
  eliminate the distinction between different types of onions (e.g., yellow onions,
  white onions, red onions). Therefore, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates
  and should be treated as separate instances within the context of a vegetable classification
  system.'
