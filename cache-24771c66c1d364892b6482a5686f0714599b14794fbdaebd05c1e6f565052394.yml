  While both "chicken broth" and "rotisserie chicken" are poultry-derived foods, they
  serve different purposes and have distinct nutritional profiles. Chicken broth is
  primarily a liquid made by simmering chicken bones, vegetables, and seasonings to
  extract flavors and some nutrients. Rotisserie chicken, on the other hand, refers
  to a whole chicken that has been seasoned and cooked on a rotating spit, resulting
  in tender, juicy meat with crispy skin. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
