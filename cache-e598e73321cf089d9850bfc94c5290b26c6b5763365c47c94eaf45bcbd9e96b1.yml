text: "Among the dairy products listed, **Sour cream** is the most adequate class\
  \ for discussion.\n\nSour cream is a thick, creamy dairy product made from cow's\
  \ milk by adding bacteria, specifically Lactobacillus acidophilus, to the milk.\
  \ It has a high fat content, ranging from 10% to 30%, and a slightly sweet and tangy\
  \ flavor. \n\nButter, cheese, and milk are all dairy products, but they have different\
  \ fat and protein contents and different uses in cooking. Yogurt, on the other hand,\
  \ is a fermented dairy product made from milk, but it is higher in protein and lower\
  \ in fat than sour cream.\n\nTherefore, for a concise class on sour cream, it is\
  \ the most adequate choice among the listed dairy products."
