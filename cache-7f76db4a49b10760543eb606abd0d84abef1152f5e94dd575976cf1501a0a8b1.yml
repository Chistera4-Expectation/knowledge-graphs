text: ' No. Fireweed honey and organic clover honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They are two different types of honey with distinct characteristics
  and origins. While they may both fall under the broader category of "honey," merging
  them would result in loss of important distinctions between these specific varieties.'
