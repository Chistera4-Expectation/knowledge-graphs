text: No, Green onions and Yellow onions should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of onions, they have distinct characteristics
  and uses in cooking. Green onions (scallions) have a milder flavor and are often
  used as a garnish, while Yellow onions (sometimes called brown onions) have a stronger
  flavor and are typically used in cooking.
