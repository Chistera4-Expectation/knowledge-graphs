text: No, 'Flavored Water' and 'Purified Water' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  characteristics. Flavored water contains added flavors, while purified water has
  undergone a filtration process to remove impurities. These differences make them
  separate entities in terms of classification.
