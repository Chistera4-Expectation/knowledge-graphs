  While both walnut oil and palm oil are indeed edible vegetable oils, they belong
  to distinct categories with unique nutritional profiles, sources, production methods,
  and uses. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Here''s why:


  1. Nutritional profile: Walnut oil has a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty
  acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fats while being low in saturated fats. It also
  contains essential omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids along with antioxidants like
  vitamin E. On the other hand, palm oil consists mainly of saturated and monounsaturated
  fats; its content of PUFAs is much lower than that found in walnut oil. Moreover,
  palm oil naturally contains beta-carotene and vitamin E tocopherols but lacks omega-3
  and omega-6 fatty acids.

  2. Source: As their names suggest, walnut oil comes from cold-pressing ripe walnuts,
  whereas palm oil originates from the fruit of oil palms. These different plant sources
  result in varying chemical compositions and properties between these two types of
  oils.

  3. Production method: The extraction process for each type of oil differs significantly
  due to the differences in seed structure, size, and composition. Cold pressing is
  commonly used for extracting walnut oil without using chemicals or heat. Meanwhile,
  palm fruits undergo sterilization before their flesh is pressed to produce crude
  palm oil. Afterward, this crude oil goes through further refining steps involving
  degumming, bleaching, deodorizing, and fractionation.

  4. Uses: Due to their contrasting flavors, aromas, smoke points, and stabilities
  at higher temperatures, walnut oil and palm oil have different culinary applications.
  For instance, walnut oil serves well for salad dressings, drizzling over cooked
  foods, and baking at relatively low temperatures because of its delicate flavor
  and comparatively low smoke point. Conversely, thanks to its stability and high
  smoke point, palm oil is often utilized in deep-frying, confectionery manufacturing,
  and food processing industries. Additionally, palm oil plays an important role in
  non-food products such as cosmetics and biofuels.'
