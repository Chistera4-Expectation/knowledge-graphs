text: ' The most adequate class for protein would be "Meat and Dairy" which includes:
  Beef, Cheese, Edible Crustaceans, Edible Fish, Pork-derived Food, Poultry-derived
  Food. Milk, and Yogurt. These foods are considered complete proteins as they provide
  all nine essential amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own. However,
  it is worth noting that some plant-based sources such as edible seeds, edible vegetables,
  and edible vegetal oil also contain protein but may not provide all essential amino
  acids in one source.'
