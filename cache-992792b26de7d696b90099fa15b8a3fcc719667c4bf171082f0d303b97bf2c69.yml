  While chicken breast is a single ingredient that can be used to make chicken salad,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Chicken salad is a dish that typically
  includes chicken breast along with other ingredients such as mayonnaise, celery,
  onions, and seasonings. Therefore, chicken salad has additional meanings and properties
  beyond just being chicken breast.'
