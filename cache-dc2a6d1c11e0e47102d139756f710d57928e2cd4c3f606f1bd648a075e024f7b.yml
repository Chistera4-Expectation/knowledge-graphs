text: ' No. While cottage cheese and ricotta cheese are both types of fresh cheeses
  with similar nutritional profiles, they have distinct textures, flavors, and uses
  in recipes. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate from a semantic and
  ontological standpoint. Merging these terms would result in loss of important distinctions
  between two related but unique food items.'
