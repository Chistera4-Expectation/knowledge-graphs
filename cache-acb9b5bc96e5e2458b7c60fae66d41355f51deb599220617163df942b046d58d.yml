text: No, Guinea Fowl Soup and Ostrich Soup should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from poultry, they come from
  different types of birds, which can result in distinct nutritional profiles and
  culinary characteristics. Thus, they should remain as separate instances within
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
