text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are sauces, they have different
  ingredients, uses, and nutritional profiles. "Marinara sauce" is typically made
  from tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs, while "Soy sauce" is made from fermented
  soybeans, wheat, and salt. Merging them would result in loss of information and
  incorrect categorization.
