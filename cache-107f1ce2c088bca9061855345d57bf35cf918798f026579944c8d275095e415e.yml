  While chicken nuggets and chicken tacos both contain poultry meat, they are not
  semantic nor ontological duplicates because they have different preparation methods,
  ingredients, nutritional profiles, and cultural contexts. Chicken nuggets typically
  consist of ground and formed chicken pieces that may include additional fillers
  and breading, while chicken tacos involve cooked chicken placed inside a tortilla
  with various toppings and seasonings. Merging them would disregard these distinct
  characteristics and create confusion for consumers seeking specific information
  about each food item.'
