  ''Hot Sauce'' and ''Instances of the Sauce class'' are not semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They represent different concepts:


  * **Hot Sauce**: A specific type of sauce.

  * **Instances of the Sauce class**: A group of objects that conform to the Sauce
  class definition.


  While they may be related, they are not duplicates.'
