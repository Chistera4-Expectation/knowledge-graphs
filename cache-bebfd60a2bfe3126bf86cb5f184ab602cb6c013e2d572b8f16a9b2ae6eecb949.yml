text: As a dietician, I can provide a professional opinion based on the information
  provided. In the context of a Sauce class, if 'Satay sauce' and 'Sauce' are indeed
  semantic and ontological duplicates, then merging them would make sense. However,
  since 'Satay sauce' is a specific type of sauce, it might be better to keep them
  separate to maintain a clear distinction between general sauce types and specific
  sauce varieties. This would allow for more accurate categorization and information
  within the class.
