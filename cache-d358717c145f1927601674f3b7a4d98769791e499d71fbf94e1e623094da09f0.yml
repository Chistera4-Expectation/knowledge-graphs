text: No, they should not be merged. While both are considered yogurt alternatives,
  'Frozen Yogurt' is made with dairy products and is a frozen dessert, while 'Non-Dairy
  Yogurt' is made without dairy and is typically a plant-based alternative. They serve
  different dietary needs and preferences, so they should be kept separate in the
  Yogurt class.
