text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'A2 Butter' and 'Whipped
  Butter' are types of butter, they have different characteristics and uses. 'A2 Butter'
  refers to a type of butter that contains A2 beta-casein proteins, which some people
  believe have health benefits. 'Whipped Butter,' on the other hand, is butter that
  has been aerated to create a lighter, more spreadable consistency. These differences
  make them distinct instances in the butter class.
