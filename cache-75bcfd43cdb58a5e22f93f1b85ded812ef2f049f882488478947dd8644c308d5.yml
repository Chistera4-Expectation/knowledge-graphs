text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are edible vegetal oils,
  they come from different sources (apricot kernels and wheat germs, respectively)
  and have different nutritional profiles and uses. They are distinct types of vegetal
  oils and should be treated as separate entities in a classification system.
