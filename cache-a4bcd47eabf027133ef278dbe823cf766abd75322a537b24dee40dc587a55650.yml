text: No, California rolls and sushi rolling mat should not be merged together as
  they are separate entities. California rolls are a type of sushi, while a sushi
  rolling mat is a tool used to prepare sushi. They are related in the context of
  sushi preparation, but they are distinct entities and should not be merged as duplicates.
