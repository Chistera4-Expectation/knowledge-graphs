text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of tea with different
  characteristics, flavors, and origins. Rooibos tea comes from the red bush plant
  native to South Africa, while white tea is made from the delicate buds and young
  leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. Although both are types of tea, they have
  unique properties and should be treated as separate instances in a classification
  system.
