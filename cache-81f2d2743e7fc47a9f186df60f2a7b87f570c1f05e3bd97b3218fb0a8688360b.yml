text: No, the instances 'Crab meat' and 'Spider Crab' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both 'Crab meat' and 'Spider Crab' belong to the
  Edible Crustaceans class, they represent different types of crustaceans. 'Crab meat'
  refers to the edible flesh of various crab species, whereas 'Spider Crab' refers
  to a specific type of crab (also known as the European spider crab or Maia squinado)
  that belongs to the crab family. Merging them would not accurately represent the
  distinct crab species and could cause confusion in categorization.
