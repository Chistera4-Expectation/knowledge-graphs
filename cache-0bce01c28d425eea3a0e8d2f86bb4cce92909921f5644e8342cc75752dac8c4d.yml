text: "No, these two instances should not be merged together. \n\n'Mascarpone cheese'\
  \ is a specific type of cheese used as an ingredient, while 'Optional: additional\
  \ cheese for topping' refers to a potential variation in a recipe where the user\
  \ can choose to add more cheese on top for flavor or presentation. They serve different\
  \ purposes in the context of a recipe and should remain separate instances."
