  The two instances, "Boneless, skinless chicken breast" and "Fried chicken," are
  not identical in their preparation methods, nutritional content, and health benefits.
  Boneless, skinless chicken breast is a lean protein that is low in fat and calories,
  while fried chicken is typically breaded and deep-fried, making it higher in fat,
  sodium, and calories. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
