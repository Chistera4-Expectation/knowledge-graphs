text: No, Ceylon Tea and Pu-erh Tea should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. They are two distinct types of tea with different origins,
  processing methods, and flavors. Ceylon Tea, also known as Sri Lankan tea, is typically
  black tea grown in Sri Lanka, while Pu-erh Tea is a unique type of fermented tea
  from the Yunnan province of China.
