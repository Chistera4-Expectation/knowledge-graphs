text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'Turkey Stock' and 'chicken/vegetable
  stock' are poultry-derived stocks, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  'Turkey Stock' is made exclusively from turkey, while 'chicken/vegetable stock'
  is made from a combination of chicken and vegetable components. These two stocks
  have different ingredients and flavor profiles, so they should be kept as separate
  instances.
