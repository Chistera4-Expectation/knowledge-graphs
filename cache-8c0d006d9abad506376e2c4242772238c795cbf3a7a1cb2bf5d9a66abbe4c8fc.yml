text: ' No. While both "brand" and "strong coffee" may be related to the topic of
  coffee, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. "Brand" refers to a specific
  company or identifier that produces a product, while "strong coffee" describes a
  characteristic or quality of the coffee itself. Therefore, these two concepts represent
  distinct and unique pieces of information about coffee.'
