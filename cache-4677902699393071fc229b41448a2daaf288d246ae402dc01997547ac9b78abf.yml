  While both 'Fish' and 'Sashimi-grade fish' are types of edible fish, they have different
  properties and uses. 'Sashimi-grade fish' refers specifically to fish that is suitable
  for eating raw, typically in sashimi or sushi dishes, while 'Fish' is a more general
  term that encompasses all edible fish species, regardless of their preparation method.
