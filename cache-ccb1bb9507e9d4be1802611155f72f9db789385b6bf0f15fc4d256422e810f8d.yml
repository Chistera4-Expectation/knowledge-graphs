text: No, Hemp Seed Oil and Walnut Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they come from different
  sources (hemp seeds and walnuts, respectively) and have distinct nutritional profiles,
  flavors, and uses. They can coexist as separate instances within the Edible Vegetal
  Oil class.
