text: No, they should not be merged together. Drinkable Yogurt and Vegan Yogurt serve
  different purposes and have different characteristics. Drinkable Yogurt is a type
  of yogurt that is designed to be consumed like a beverage, while Vegan Yogurt is
  made without any animal-derived ingredients, making it suitable for those following
  a vegan diet. Both types can be made with or without dairy, so they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
