text: ' It is difficult to determine the most adequate class for "Optional" based
  on the given list as they all represent different food and drink categories. The
  term "optional" is not specific enough to be used as a class name in this context.
  Instead, consider using more descriptive terms such as "Discretionary Foods," "Foods
  for Limited Consumption," or "Occasional Foods." These classes could include items
  like Alcoholic Drinks, Energy Drinks, Sauces, Sweeteners, and Sugary Beverages.
  However, it ultimately depends on the specific nutritional framework being followed.'
