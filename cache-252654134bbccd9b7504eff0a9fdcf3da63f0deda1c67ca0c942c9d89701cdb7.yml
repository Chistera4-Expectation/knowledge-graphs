text: No, Pork Roast and Salt Pork should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are derived from pork, they are different cuts and have different
  preparation methods and uses in culinary contexts. Pork Roast typically refers to
  a larger cut of meat that is cooked as a whole, often roasted in an oven, whereas
  Salt Pork is a cured, salted cut of pork belly or fatback that is typically used
  as a flavoring agent or cooking fat.
