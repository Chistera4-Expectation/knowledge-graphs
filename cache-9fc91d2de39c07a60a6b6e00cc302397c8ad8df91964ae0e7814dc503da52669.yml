text: ' No. Grilled chicken and turkey chili are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both belong to the poultry-derived food class. They have different
  preparation methods, ingredients, nutritional profiles, taste, texture, and uses
  in culinary applications, making them distinct from one another.'
