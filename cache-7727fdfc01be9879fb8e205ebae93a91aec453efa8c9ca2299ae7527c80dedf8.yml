text: No, Acacia Honey and Blueberry Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have distinct characteristics,
  flavors, and nutritional profiles due to the different plants from which they are
  derived. Acacia honey comes from the nectar of Acacia flowers, while Blueberry honey
  comes from the nectar of blueberry flowers. Merging them would not accurately represent
  the unique properties of each type of honey.
