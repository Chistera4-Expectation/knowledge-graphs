  Coriander seeds and chia seeds are two different types of edible seeds with distinct
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. While they can both provide a crunchy texture
  to dishes, they have different flavors and functional properties that make them
  suitable for different applications. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
