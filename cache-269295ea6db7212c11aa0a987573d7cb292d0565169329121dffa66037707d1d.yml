text: No, Chili Powder and Chinese Five-spice Powder should not be merged as they
  are different spice blends with distinct flavor profiles and ingredients. Chili
  Powder is made primarily from ground chili peppers, while Chinese Five-spice Powder
  is a blend of five different spices, usually including star anise, fennel seeds,
  Sichuan peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon. They serve different culinary purposes
  and are used in different types of dishes.
