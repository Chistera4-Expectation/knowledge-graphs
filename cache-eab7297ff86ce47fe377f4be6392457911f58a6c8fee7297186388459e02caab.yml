text: ' No. Five-spice powder and bouillon powder are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged. They are two distinct food seasonings with
  different ingredients and uses. Five-spice powder is a blend of five spices commonly
  used in Chinese cuisine, typically including star anise, cloves, cinnamon, Sichuan
  pepper, and fennel seeds. On the other hand, bouillon powder is made from dehydrated
  vegetables, meat, or fish stock, often used to add flavor to soups, stews, and sauces.
  Therefore, they have unique properties that make them non-duplicative within the
  context of a Food Seasoning class.'
