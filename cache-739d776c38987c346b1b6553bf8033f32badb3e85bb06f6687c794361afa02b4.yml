text: No, Maltose syrup and Maple syrup should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates because they are two different types of sweeteners with distinct compositions
  and origins. Maltose syrup is primarily composed of maltose, a disaccharide derived
  from starch, while Maple syrup is made from the sap of maple trees and consists
  of various sugars and other components, including sucrose, fructose, and glucose.
