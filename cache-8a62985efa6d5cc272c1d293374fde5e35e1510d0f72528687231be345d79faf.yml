text: ' No. Corn oil and pumpkin seed oil are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they are both types of edible vegetable oils, they come from different plants
  (corn and pumpkin seeds, respectively) and have unique nutritional profiles and
  uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate instances.'
