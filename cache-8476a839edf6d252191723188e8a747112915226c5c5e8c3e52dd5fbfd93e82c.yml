text: As a dietician, my expertise is in nutrition and not in water classification
  or ontology. However, from a general perspective, Spring-fed Water and Tap Water
  are not necessarily semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking
  water, they have different sources and processes. Spring-fed Water comes from natural
  springs, while Tap Water is treated and distributed by a water utility. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.
