  Although both fresh basil leaves and fresh chili peppers belong to the same broader
  category of "edible vegetables," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They have distinct tastes, textures, nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and visual
  characteristics that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to keep these two instances separate within an edible vegetable class.'
