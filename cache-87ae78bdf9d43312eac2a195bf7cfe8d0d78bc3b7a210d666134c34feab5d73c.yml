text: No, Alkaline Water and Water should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of drinking water, they have distinct properties
  and characteristics. Alkaline Water has a higher pH level than regular water, which
  can affect its taste and potential health benefits. Therefore, they should be treated
  as separate instances in the Drinking Water class.
