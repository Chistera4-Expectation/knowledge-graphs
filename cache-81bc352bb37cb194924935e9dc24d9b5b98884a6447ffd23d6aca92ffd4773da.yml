text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both oils are derived from nuts, they have different chemical compositions, flavors,
  and uses in cooking. Sesame oil has a nutty aroma, while walnut oil has its own
  distinct flavor. They are distinct enough to warrant separate instances in the Edible
  Vegetal Oil class.
