text: No, "Chicken Feet" and "Chicken Soup" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from chicken, they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional profiles, preparation methods, and cultural
  uses. "Chicken Feet" are a specific part of the chicken and are often used in certain
  cuisines for their collagen content, while "Chicken Soup" is a more general term
  for a soup made with chicken as the primary ingredient and can include various other
  ingredients and preparation methods.
