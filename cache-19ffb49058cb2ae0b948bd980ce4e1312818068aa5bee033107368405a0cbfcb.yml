text: ' "Infusion Drink (with Vitamin C)" would be the most appropriate class name
  for a vitamin C infusion, as it clearly indicates that this is an infused beverage
  specifically designed to deliver vitamin C. Coffee and tea are not typically considered
  infusions in the same way that an herbal or fruit tea might be, nor do they naturally
  contain high levels of vitamin C like an infusion drink specifically formulated
  with added vitamin C.'
