text: No, 'Flavored Butter' and 'Plant-based Butter' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Flavored Butter' refers to butter that has
  been infused with additional flavors, while 'Plant-based Butter' refers to a butter
  substitute made from plant-based ingredients. These two types of butter have different
  ingredients, nutritional profiles, and uses, so they should remain separate categories.
