text: No, these two instances should not be merged together as they have distinct
  differences in their preparation and use. Thinly sliced beef typically refers to
  a cut of beef that has been sliced thinly, often for use in sandwiches, stir-fries,
  or salads. Beef patties, on the other hand, are ground beef that has been formed
  into a patty shape, often for use in burgers or meatballs. These two instances have
  different nutritional profiles and preparation methods, making them separate entities
  in a dietary context.
