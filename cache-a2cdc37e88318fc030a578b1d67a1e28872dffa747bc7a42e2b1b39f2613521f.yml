text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Fish fillet' and 'Sashimi-grade fish' are edible fish, they have different characteristics
  and purposes. Fish fillet refers to a boneless piece of fish, often cut from the
  body of the fish, while sashimi-grade fish is a higher-quality fish that is specifically
  prepared for raw consumption, as in sushi or sashimi dishes. These are distinct
  concepts within the Edible Fish class.
