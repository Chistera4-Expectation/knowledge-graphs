text: No, Black Tea and Herbal Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both types of tea, they differ significantly in their
  composition and characteristics. Black tea is made from the leaves of the Camellia
  sinensis plant and is processed through oxidation, while herbal teas are made from
  a variety of dried flowers, fruits, and herbs and do not typically contain the Camellia
  sinensis plant. They also have different flavor profiles, nutritional content, and
  health benefits.
