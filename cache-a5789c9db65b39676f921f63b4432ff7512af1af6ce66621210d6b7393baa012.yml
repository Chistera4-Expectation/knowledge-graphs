text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both 'Fish fillet' and 'Grilled salmon' are instances of the Edible Fish class,
  they represent different types of fish preparations. 'Fish fillet' is a general
  term for a boneless piece of fish, while 'Grilled salmon' refers to a specific preparation
  method for salmon fish. Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
