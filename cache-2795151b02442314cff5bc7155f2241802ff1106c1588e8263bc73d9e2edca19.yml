  While both "Energy drink" and "Monster Energy" fall under the broader category of
  energy drinks, they are not the same thing. "Energy drink" is a general term for
  a class of beverages, while "Monster Energy" is a specific brand within that class.
  They have different ingredients, flavors, and marketing, and should therefore be
  treated as separate instances.
