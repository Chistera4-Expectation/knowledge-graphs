  While Greek Seasoning and Old Bay Seasoning may have some similarities as they are
  both used to add flavor to food, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They contain different ingredients and are typically used in different cultural
  cuisines (Mediterranean for Greek Seasoning and Maryland-style seafood for Old Bay
  Seasoning). Merging them would result in loss of specificity and accuracy regarding
  their unique properties and uses.'
