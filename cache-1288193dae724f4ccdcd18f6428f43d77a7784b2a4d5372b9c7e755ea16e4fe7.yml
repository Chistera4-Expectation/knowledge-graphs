text: ' Neither coffee nor tea are appropriate rehydration solutions. Rehydration
  solutions typically contain water, electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium),
  and sometimes sugars to help replenish fluids lost through diarrhea or vomiting.
  Coffee and tea contain caffeine and tannins which can have dehydrating effects on
  the body. Therefore, neither of these beverages would make an adequate rehydration
  solution. Instead, consider using oral rehydration salts or other specifically formulated
  rehydration drinks.'
