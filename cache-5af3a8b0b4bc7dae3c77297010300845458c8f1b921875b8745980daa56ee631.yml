text: As a dietician, I can provide input on the nutritional aspects of water, but
  the decision on merging instances in a Drinking Water class should be made by a
  subject matter expert in that specific domain. However, from a general perspective,
  'Artisanal Water' and 'Water' could be considered semantic and ontologic duplicates
  since they both refer to the same substance (H2O) but may differ in their source
  or processing. The decision to merge them would depend on the specific context and
  the requirements of the system or database being developed.
