text: No, the instances 'Hen of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Shiitake mushrooms' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both
  edible mushrooms, they are distinct species with different characteristics, nutritional
  profiles, and culinary uses. Hen of the Woods Mushroom (Grifola frondosa) is a polypore
  mushroom with a savory, earthy flavor, while Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes)
  are characterized by their rich, umami taste. They should be treated as separate
  entities in a classification system for edible mushrooms.
