  ''Fresh Mozzarella Cheese'' and ''Optional: additional cheese for topping'' serve
  different purposes in a recipe or meal context. ''Fresh Mozzarella Cheese'' is a
  specific type of cheese used as an ingredient, while ''Optional: additional cheese
  for topping'' refers to the possibility of adding extra cheese on top, which could
  include a variety of cheeses or even the same type of cheese. They should remain
  separate instances in the Cheese class.'
