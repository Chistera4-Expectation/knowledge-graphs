text: No, they should not be merged as they have different ingredients, preparation
  methods, and uses in cooking. Beurre blanc sauce is a French sauce made from butter,
  shallots, and white wine, while tomato sauce is made from tomatoes, onions, garlic,
  and various seasonings. They serve different purposes in the culinary world and
  should be kept as distinct entities.
