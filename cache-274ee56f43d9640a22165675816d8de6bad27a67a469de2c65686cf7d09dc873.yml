text: No, "Red pepper flakes" and "White pepper" should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Although both are forms of pepper, they have
  distinct flavors and uses in cooking. Red pepper flakes are made from dried and
  crushed red chili peppers, providing a spicy, hot flavor, while white pepper is
  made from the seeds of peppercorns, offering a milder, earthier flavor. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the differences in their culinary applications
  and flavor profiles.
