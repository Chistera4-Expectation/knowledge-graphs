  While both safflower oil and walnut oil are types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, taste, smoke point,
  and culinary uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Here are some key differences between the two:


  1. Nutritional Profile: Safflower oil is high in monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) and
  polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs), while walnut oil has a higher ratio of omega-3 fatty
  acids compared to other oils. This makes walnut oil particularly beneficial for
  heart health.

  2. Taste: Safflower oil has a neutral flavor that doesn''t interfere with the taste
  of food. Walnut oil, on the other hand, has a rich, distinctive nutty flavor that
  can enhance the taste of certain dishes.

  3. Smoke Point: The smoke point refers to the temperature at which an oil starts
  to break down and produce harmful compounds. Safflower oil has a higher smoke point
  than walnut oil, making it more suitable for cooking at high temperatures.

  4. Culinary Uses: Due to its mild flavor and high smoke point, safflower oil is
  often used for deep-frying, baking, and stir-frying. In contrast, walnut oil is
  typically reserved for salad dressings, drizzling over finished dishes, and adding
  depth of flavor to sauces due to its low smoke point and strong taste.


  Given these differences, it is important to maintain separate categories for safflower
  oil and walnut oil in any classification system related to edible vegetable oils.'
