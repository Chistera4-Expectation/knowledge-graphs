text: ' No, Stock fish and Swordfish should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of edible fish with different nutritional profiles and characteristics. While
  both can be consumed as food, they belong to separate taxonomic categories: stock
  fish is typically a term used for air-dried cod, while swordfish belongs to the
  billfish family. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
