text: ' The most adequate class name for "Natural" among the given list could be "Foods
  or Beverages of Natural Origin". However, if we are looking for a more concise class
  name, I would suggest using "Whole Foods" as it generally refers to unprocessed
  or minimally processed foods that come directly from nature. This category includes
  items like Edible Fruits, Edible Vegetables, Edible Nuts and Seeds, Edible Grains
  (like Rice), Edible Mushrooms, Edible Seaweed, Edible Crustaceans, Edible Fish,
  and Honey. Other items on the list can be classified under different categories
  based on their processing level such as Beverages (Alcoholic Drinks, Juices, Tea,
  Coffee), Dairy Products (Milk, Yogurt), Condiments (Butter, Sauces, Food Dressings),
  Sweeteners (Sugar, Honey), and Processed Foods (Bread, Pasta types, Energy Drinks).'
