text: ' No. Alfalfa honey and cherry blossom honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, even though they both belong to the broader category of "honey." They
  have distinct botanical origins, which contribute to their different flavors, colors,
  and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate
  instances to preserve this level of detail and accuracy in your knowledge base.'
