  While both "Dipping sauce" and "Sauce" are related to culinary applications, they
  have different meanings and uses within that context. A "Sauce" is a broad category
  of liquid, creamy, or semi-solid food accompaniments used to enhance the flavor
  of other dishes. On the other hand, a "Dipping sauce" specifically refers to sauces
  designed for dipping foods like finger foods or appetizers, such as ranch dressing
  or barbecue sauce. Merging them would not accurately represent their distinct functions
  in cuisine.'
