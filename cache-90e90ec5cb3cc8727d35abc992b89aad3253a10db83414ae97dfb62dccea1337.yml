text: No, Pheasant Patties and Quail Patties should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the Poultry-derived Food class,
  they are made from different types of poultry, which results in differences in taste,
  texture, and nutritional profile. Therefore, they should be considered distinct
  instances within the class.
