text: ' No. While "chopped onions" is a specific form of the more general concept
  "onion," they are not identical from either a semantic or an ontological perspective.
  Semantically, "chopped onions" refers to prepared vegetables that have been cut
  into small pieces, whereas "onion" denotes a type of vegetable characterized by
  its layered structure and pungent taste. Ontologically, these two concepts belong
  to different categories: "chopped onions" represents a state or condition of an
  onion, while "onion" describes a fundamental kind of entity. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
