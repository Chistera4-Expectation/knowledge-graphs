text: No, the instances 'Mitten Crab' and 'Porcelain Crab' should not be merged together
  as they are distinct species with different characteristics. Mitten Crabs (Eriocheir
  sinensis) and Porcelain Crabs (Petrolisthes) belong to different families and genera
  within the order Decapoda, and they have different appearances, habitats, and culinary
  uses. Merging them would be incorrect in terms of semantics and ontology.
