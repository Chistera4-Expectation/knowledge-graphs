text: No, Raspberry Honey and Sage Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of honey, they
  are different types of honey derived from different sources (raspberry flowers and
  sage flowers, respectively), and therefore, they should be considered as separate
  instances in the Honey class.
