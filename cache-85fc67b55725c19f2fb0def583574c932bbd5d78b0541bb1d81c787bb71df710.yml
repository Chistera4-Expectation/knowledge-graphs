text: No, they should not be merged together. While both ostrich wings and pheasant
  wings are poultry-derived foods, they are distinct types of poultry and have different
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Therefore, they should be treated as separate
  instances in a Poultry-derived Food class.
