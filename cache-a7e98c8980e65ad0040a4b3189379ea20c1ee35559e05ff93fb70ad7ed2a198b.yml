  Avocado oil and cooking oil are two distinct types of edible vegetable oils with
  different properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Avocado oil is derived from
  avocados and is rich in monounsaturated fats, while cooking oil can refer to a variety
  of oils (e.g., olive oil, canola oil, vegetable oil) with varying compositions and
  uses.
