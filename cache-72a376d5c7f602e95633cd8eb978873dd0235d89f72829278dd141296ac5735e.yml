  Hemp seeds and pumpkin seeds are two different seeds with distinct nutritional profiles,
  health benefits, and culinary uses. While they are both edible seeds, they have
  different chemical compositions and physiological effects on the body. Therefore,
  they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
