  While both 'A2 Butter' and 'Salted Butter' are types of butter, they are different
  in terms of their properties, such as flavor and production methods. 'A2 Butter'
  specifically refers to butter made from milk that comes from cows with the A2 beta-casein
  protein, while 'Salted Butter' has added salt for flavor and preservation. These
  differences make them distinct types of butter and not duplicates.
