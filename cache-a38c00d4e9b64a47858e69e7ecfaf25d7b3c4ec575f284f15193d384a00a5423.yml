text: No, Acacia Honey and Pine Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have distinct properties,
  flavors, and characteristics that differentiate them from each other. Merging them
  would result in a loss of information about these specific honey types.
