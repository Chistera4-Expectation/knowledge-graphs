text: 'As a dietician, my answer is no, these two instances should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they may appear similar, they serve
  different purposes in the context of food seasoning.


  ''Additional seasonings'' typically refers to extra spices, herbs, or flavorings
  that can be added to enhance the taste of a dish. They are not necessarily required
  for the recipe to work, but they can improve the overall flavor profile.


  ''Optional ingredients,'' on the other hand, can refer to any ingredient that is
  not essential to the recipe''s success but can be included to customize the dish
  to one''s taste preferences. This can include additional seasonings, but it may
  also include other ingredients such as vegetables, proteins, or grains.


  Merging these two instances would not accurately represent the nuances of each concept
  in the context of food seasoning. It is essential to maintain the distinction between
  ''Additional seasonings'' and ''Optional ingredients'' to provide clear guidance
  on how to adjust and customize recipes.'
