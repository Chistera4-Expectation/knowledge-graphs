text: No, 'Glacier Water' and 'Hard Water' should not be merged as they represent
  different types of drinking water. Glacier water refers to water that originates
  from glaciers and is typically considered pure and clean. Hard water, on the other
  hand, contains high levels of minerals such as calcium and magnesium, which can
  affect its taste and the effectiveness of soap and detergents. While both are types
  of drinking water, they have distinct characteristics and should not be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates.
