text: No, the instances 'Lotus Leaf Rice' and 'Scent leaves' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. 'Lotus Leaf Rice' is a dish made
  with rice wrapped in lotus leaves, while 'Scent leaves' refer to a type of herb
  used in cooking, which are not edible on their own. They are distinct and serve
  different purposes in the context of an Edible Vegetable class.
