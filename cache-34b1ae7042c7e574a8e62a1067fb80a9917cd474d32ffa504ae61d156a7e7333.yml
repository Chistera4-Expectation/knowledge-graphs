text: No, the instances 'Vegetable' and 'other vegetables for variation' should not
  be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they may seem similar,
  they serve different purposes in the context of the Edible Vegetable class. 'Vegetable'
  is a general term representing the class itself, while 'other vegetables for variation'
  suggests a subset of specific vegetables within the class that can provide variation
  in a diet. They represent distinct concepts and should be kept separate for clarity
  and accurate classification.
