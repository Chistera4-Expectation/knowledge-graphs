text: No, the instances 'Pheasant Drumsticks' and 'Pheasant Wings' should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both derived from poultry,
  they are distinct cuts with different nutritional profiles and culinary applications.
  They should be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
