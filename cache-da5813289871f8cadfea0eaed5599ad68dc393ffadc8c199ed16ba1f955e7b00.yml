text: As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on the classification of green chili
  and other chili peppers. While they may have similarities in terms of being edible
  vegetables and belonging to the same botanical family (Capsicum), they can differ
  in terms of their appearance, taste, and heat levels. Therefore, from a culinary
  and nutritional standpoint, it may be beneficial to distinguish between green chili
  and other chili peppers. However, the decision to merge or separate these instances
  in a specific classification system or ontology depends on the intended purpose
  and structure of that system.
