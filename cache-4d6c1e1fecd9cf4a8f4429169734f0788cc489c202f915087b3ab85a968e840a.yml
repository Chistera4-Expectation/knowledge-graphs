text: No, these instances should not be merged together as they are distinct types
  of edible mushrooms with different characteristics, appearances, and culinary uses.
  Enoki mushrooms have a long, slender stem and small white cap, while wood ear mushrooms
  have a brown, ear-shaped cap and are often used for their texture in dishes. Although
  they may both be classified under the broader category of edible mushrooms, they
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
