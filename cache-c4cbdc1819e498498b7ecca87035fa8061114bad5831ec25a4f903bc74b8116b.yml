text: No, the instances 'Beech Mushroom' and 'Velvet Pioppini Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both edible
  mushrooms, they are different species with distinct characteristics and properties.
  Beech Mushroom (Hypsizygus tessellatus) and Velvet Pioppini Mushroom (Agrocybe aegerita)
  should be treated as separate entities in a dietician's classification of edible
  mushrooms.
