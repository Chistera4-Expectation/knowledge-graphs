text: As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspects of these
  sauces, but the decision on whether to merge them as semantic and ontologic duplicates
  is more of a data modeling or programming decision. However, I can inform you that
  Chili sauce and Piri Piri sauce have different ingredients and heat levels, so they
  are not identical in terms of taste or nutritional content.
