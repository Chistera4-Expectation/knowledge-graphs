text: No, they should not be merged together. While both products involve fermented
  milk, they have distinct characteristics and properties. Frozen Yogurt is a frozen
  dessert made from yogurt, while Kefir Yogurt is a fermented milk drink that uses
  kefir grains as a starter culture. The differences in their form, texture, and production
  process make them unique and should be treated as separate instances in the Yogurt
  class.
