text: ' No. White pepper and habanero pepper are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they both belong to the same general category of "pepper," they have distinct
  characteristics and uses. White pepper is made from fully ripe pepper berries that
  have had their outer shells removed, resulting in a milder flavor than black pepper.
  Habanero pepper, on the other hand, is a type of chili pepper known for its fruity,
  slightly sweet flavor and intense heat. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge these two instances as duplicates.'
