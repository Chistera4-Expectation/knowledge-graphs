text: ' No. Corn and cornstarch are not duplicate entries. While they both come from
  corn, they have different uses in cooking and distinct nutritional profiles. Corn
  is a whole grain that provides fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, while
  cornstarch is a refined starch often used as a thickening agent with little nutritional
  value. They should be treated as separate entities in the Edible Vegetable class.'
