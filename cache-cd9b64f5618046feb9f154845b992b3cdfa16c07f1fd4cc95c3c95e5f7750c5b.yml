text: ' No. Avocado oil and extra virgin olive oil are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they are both edible vegetable oils. They have different
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and originate from different plant sources
  (avocados vs. olives). Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate instances.'
