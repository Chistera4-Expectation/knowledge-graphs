  While both "Fish sauce" and "Piri piri sauce" are types of sauces, they serve different
  purposes and have distinct ingredients. Fish sauce is made from fish that has been
  fermented with water and salt, while Piri piri sauce is typically made from chili
  peppers, garlic, onion, lemon juice, oil, and spices. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
