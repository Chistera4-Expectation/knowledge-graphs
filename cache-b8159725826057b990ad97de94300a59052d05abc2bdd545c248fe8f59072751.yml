text: "No, they should not be merged as they have distinct ingredients and culinary\
  \ uses. Alfredo sauce typically contains butter, heavy cream, garlic, and Parmesan\
  \ cheese, while B\xE9chamel sauce consists of a roux (a mixture of butter and flour)\
  \ and milk. Although they may have some overlapping uses, they are different sauces\
  \ with unique flavor profiles and preparation methods."
