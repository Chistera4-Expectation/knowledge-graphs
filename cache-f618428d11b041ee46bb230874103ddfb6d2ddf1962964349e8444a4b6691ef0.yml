text: No, 'Darjeeling Tea' and 'Lemon Tea' should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of tea, they have distinct characteristics and
  flavors. 'Darjeeling Tea' is a black tea from the Darjeeling region in India, while
  'Lemon Tea' is a flavored tea with lemon added to it. Merging them as duplicates
  would not accurately represent the unique qualities of each type of tea.
