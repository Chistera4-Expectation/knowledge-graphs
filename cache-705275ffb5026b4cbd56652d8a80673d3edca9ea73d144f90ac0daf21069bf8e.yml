  While Caesar dressing and Ranch dressing may have some similarities, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantically, they refer to different things
  with distinct ingredients and flavors. Ontologically, they belong to different categories
  of dressings. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate.'
