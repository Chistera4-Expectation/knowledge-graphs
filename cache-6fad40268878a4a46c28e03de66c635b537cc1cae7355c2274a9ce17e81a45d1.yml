text: No, "Ostrich Gravy" and "Ostrich Wings" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from ostriches, they are distinct
  food items with different properties and uses. "Ostrich Gravy" refers to a sauce
  made from ostrich meat, while "Ostrich Wings" refers to the actual wing part of
  an ostrich that can be prepared and consumed as a separate dish.
