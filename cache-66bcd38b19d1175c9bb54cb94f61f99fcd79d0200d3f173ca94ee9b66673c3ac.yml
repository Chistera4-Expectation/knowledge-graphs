text: ' No. Although they are related, Balkan style yogurt is not an exact duplicate
  of regular yogurt. They may share some similarities but have distinct differences
  in taste, texture, and cultural origins. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
