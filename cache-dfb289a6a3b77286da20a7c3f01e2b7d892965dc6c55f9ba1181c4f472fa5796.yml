  Although Caesar dressing and Honey Mustard dressing may share some common characteristics
  (e.g., both are types of salad dressings), they have distinct ingredients and flavor
  profiles that make them unique. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
