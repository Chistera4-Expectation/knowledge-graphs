  While both "Dipping sauce" and "Optional dipping sauce" may seem similar, they are
  not necessarily semantic or ontological duplicates. The term "dipping sauce" generally
  refers to any type of sauce that is used for dipping food into, while "optional
  dipping sauce" implies that the sauce is not required or essential, but rather an
  optional addition to the dish. Therefore, it would be appropriate to keep these
  two terms separate to accurately reflect their distinct meanings.'
