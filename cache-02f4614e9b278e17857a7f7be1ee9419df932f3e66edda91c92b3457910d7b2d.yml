text: No, "Ostrich Stock" and "chicken/vegetable stock" should not be merged together
  as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both in the Poultry-derived
  Food class, they are made from different types of poultry (ostrich vs. chicken)
  and may have different compositions due to the inclusion of vegetable ingredients
  in the latter.
