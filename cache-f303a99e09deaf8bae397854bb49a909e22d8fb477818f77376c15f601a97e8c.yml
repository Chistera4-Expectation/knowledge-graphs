text: No, the instances 'Cremini Mushroom' and 'King Oyster Mushroom' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types
  of edible mushrooms, they are distinct species with different characteristics, nutritional
  profiles, and culinary uses. Cremini mushrooms, also known as baby portobello mushrooms,
  are a type of Agaricus bisporus, while King Oyster mushrooms belong to the Pleurotus
  eryngii species. Each has its unique qualities and should be treated as separate
  entities in the Edible Mushrooms class.
