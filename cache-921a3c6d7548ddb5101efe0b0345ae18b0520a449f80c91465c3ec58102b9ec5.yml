text: No, they should not be merged together. While they both fall under the Poultry-derived
  Food class, 'Ostrich Drumsticks' and 'Ostrich Meat' refer to specific cuts or parts
  of ostrich meat, and thus are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Merging them
  would lose information about the specific type of ostrich meat being referred to.
