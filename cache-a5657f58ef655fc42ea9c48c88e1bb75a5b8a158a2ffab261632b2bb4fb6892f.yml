text: ' No. Idli rice, also known as parboiled rice or idli rava, is a type of partially
  cooked and dried rice that has been processed to improve its cooking properties
  and nutritional value. Long grain white rice, on the other hand, is a type of milled
  rice with a long slender kernel and a low starch content, which gives it a distinct
  texture when cooked. While both types of rice can be used in similar dishes, such
  as idlis, they have different physical and chemical properties that make them unique
  and not semantic or ontological duplicates.'
