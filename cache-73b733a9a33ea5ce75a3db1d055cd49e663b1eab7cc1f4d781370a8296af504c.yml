text: No, 'Hard lemonade' and 'Hard seltzer' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they both belong to the Alcoholic Drink class,
  they are distinct types of beverages with different ingredients and characteristics.
  Hard lemonade is typically made from lemonade and alcohol, while hard seltzer is
  made from carbonated water, alcohol, and flavorings.
