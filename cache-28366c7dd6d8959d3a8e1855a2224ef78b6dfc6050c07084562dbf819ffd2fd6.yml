text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both Light Butter and Unsalted
  Butter are types of butter, they have distinct differences in their nutritional
  content and usage. Light Butter typically has fewer calories and less fat than regular
  butter, while Unsalted Butter does not have added salt. Therefore, they should be
  treated as separate instances in the Butter class.
