text: No, Safflower Oil and Soybean Oil should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of edible vegetable oils with different properties, nutritional compositions,
  and uses. While both are vegetable oils, they come from different plants (safflower
  and soybean, respectively) and have unique characteristics. Merging them would result
  in a loss of specific information and may lead to confusion.
