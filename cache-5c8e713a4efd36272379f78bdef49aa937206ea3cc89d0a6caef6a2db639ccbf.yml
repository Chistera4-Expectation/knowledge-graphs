text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are pickled vegetables, they
  are distinct types of pickled vegetables with different flavors, uses, and origins.
  Dill pickles are made from cucumbers and typically flavored with dill, while pickled
  ginger (also known as gari or amazu shoga) is made from ginger root and has a sweet
  and sour flavor profile. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique
  characteristics of each type of pickled vegetable.
