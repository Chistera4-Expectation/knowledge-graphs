text: No, Coconut water and Well water should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are distinct types of drinking water with different properties
  and sources. Coconut water is the clear liquid found inside young coconuts, while
  Well water refers to water sourced from underground wells. Although both can be
  consumed as drinking water, they are not duplicates of each other in terms of their
  composition and origin.
