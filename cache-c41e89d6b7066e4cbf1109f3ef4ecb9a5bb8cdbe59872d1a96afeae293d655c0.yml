text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are poultry-derived stocks,
  'Duck Stock' and 'Guinea Fowl Stock' come from different types of poultry and may
  have slightly different nutritional profiles and flavor profiles. Therefore, they
  should be kept as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
