text: No, 'Ostrich Meatballs' and 'Quail Meatballs' should not be merged together
  as they are derived from different types of poultry and would have different nutritional
  profiles. Although they both belong to the Poultry-derived Food class, they are
  distinct and should be treated as separate instances.
