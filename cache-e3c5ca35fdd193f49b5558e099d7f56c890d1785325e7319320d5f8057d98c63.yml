text: No, European-style Butter and Lactose-free Butter should not be merged as they
  have distinct differences. European-style butter typically has a higher fat content
  and a different flavor profile compared to standard butter, while lactose-free butter
  is made specifically for individuals who are lactose intolerant and has had lactose
  removed or reduced. These differences make them separate entities in terms of semantics
  and ontology.
