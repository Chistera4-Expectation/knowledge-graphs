text: ' No. Pasture-raised beef and beef back ribs are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They refer to different cuts of meat from cattle that have been raised
  on pasture. While they share some similarities (both come from animals raised in
  similar conditions), they differ significantly in terms of their culinary uses and
  nutritional profiles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
