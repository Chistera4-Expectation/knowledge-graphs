text: No, Clarified Butter and Light Butter should not be merged together as they
  have distinct properties and uses. Clarified butter is butter with the milk solids
  and water removed, resulting in a higher smoke point and longer shelf life. Light
  butter, on the other hand, is typically made with a higher water content and lower
  fat content than regular butter, making it a lighter option for those watching their
  calorie and fat intake. Despite both being types of butter, their differences in
  composition and applications warrant separate classifications.
