text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from poultry (pheasant), they are different dishes with distinct
  ingredients and preparation methods. Pheasant patties are likely to be made from
  ground pheasant meat and formed into patties, while pheasant soup would typically
  involve a broth with various ingredients, including pieces of pheasant meat. The
  two dishes have different nutritional profiles and cooking processes, so they should
  be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
