text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from chicken, they have different culinary preparations and presentations.
  Chicken meatballs are typically formed from ground chicken and have a round shape,
  while chicken tenders are usually strips of chicken breast or tenderloin. They are
  different food items and should be classified separately.
