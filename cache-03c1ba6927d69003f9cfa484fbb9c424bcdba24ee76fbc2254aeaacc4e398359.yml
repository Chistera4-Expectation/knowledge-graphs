  While both "Bread" and "Rye bread" refer to types of bread, they have distinct differences
  in terms of ingredients, texture, taste, and nutritional content. Rye bread is made
  with rye flour and has a denser, darker, and slightly sour flavor compared to traditional
  bread made with wheat flour. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
