text: No, the instances 'Multigrain Bread' and 'Pita Bread' should not be merged together
  as they have distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. While they both
  fall under the category of bread, they differ in terms of ingredients, texture,
  and preparation methods. Maintaining separate instances allows for more accurate
  and detailed information about each type of bread.
