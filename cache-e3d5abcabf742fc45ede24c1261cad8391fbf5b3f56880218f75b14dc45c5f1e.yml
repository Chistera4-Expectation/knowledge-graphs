text: No, Apple juice and Papaya juice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both juices, they are distinct types of
  juice made from different fruits, and they have different nutritional properties
  and flavors. Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of juices available
  and the unique characteristics of each type of juice.
