text: ' No. While "Pork" is the raw material that comes from a pig, "Roasted pork"
  refers to cooked meat prepared through roasting, which results in significant changes
  in taste, texture, and nutritional content due to heat exposure and seasoning additions.
  Therefore, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates but rather different
  stages of food preparation using the same base ingredient.'
