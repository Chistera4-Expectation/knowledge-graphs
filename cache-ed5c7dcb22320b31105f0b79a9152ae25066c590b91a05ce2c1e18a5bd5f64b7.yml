text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both 'Creamy Yogurt' and 'French Yogurt' are types of yogurt, they represent different
  characteristics and origins. 'Creamy Yogurt' refers to the texture, while 'French
  Yogurt' refers to the origin or style of yogurt. Merging them would result in loss
  of specificity and potentially confuse users.
