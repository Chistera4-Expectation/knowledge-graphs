text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Pheasant Drumsticks" and
  "Pheasant Meatballs" are derived from poultry, specifically pheasant, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. They are different preparations and forms of
  the poultry, and merging them would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived
  foods.
