text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Fried onions" and "Onions"
  are types of onions, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. "Fried onions"
  refers to onions that have been cooked in oil or fat, while "Onions" refers to the
  raw vegetable. They have different properties, uses, and nutritional values.
