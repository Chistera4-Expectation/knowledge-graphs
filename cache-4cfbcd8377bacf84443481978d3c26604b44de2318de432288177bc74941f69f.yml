text: No, the instances 'Raw Honey' and 'Sourwood Honey' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of honey with distinct
  characteristics and origins. Raw honey refers to honey that has not been heated
  or pasteurized, while Sourwood Honey is a specific type of honey made from the nectar
  of sourwood trees.
