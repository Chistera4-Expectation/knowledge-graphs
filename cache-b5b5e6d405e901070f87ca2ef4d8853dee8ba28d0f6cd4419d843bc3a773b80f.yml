text: No, Hemp Seeds and Pomegranate Seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are two distinct types of edible seeds with different
  nutritional profiles and uses. Hemp Seeds are derived from the Cannabis sativa plant
  and are a good source of protein, healthy fats, and fiber, while Pomegranate Seeds,
  also known as arils, are derived from the pomegranate fruit and are rich in antioxidants,
  fiber, and vitamins.
