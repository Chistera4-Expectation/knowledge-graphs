text: No, "Quail Sausage" and "Quail Thighs" should not be merged together as they
  are different poultry-derived food products. Quail Sausage is a processed meat product
  made from ground quail meat, while Quail Thighs are a specific cut of quail meat.
  Although both are derived from quail, they are distinct items with unique nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses.
