  The quantity of juice in a container and the type of juice are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They refer to different aspects of the juice: one is about the amount
  (quantity), while the other refers to what kind (type) it is. It would be beneficial
  for a dietitian to consider both pieces of information when evaluating juices in
  order to make informed recommendations based on factors such as serving size and
  nutritional content.'
