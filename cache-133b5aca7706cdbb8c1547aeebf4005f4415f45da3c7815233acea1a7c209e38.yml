  While both "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Grilled Chicken" contain poultry meat, they
  are not semantic nor ontological duplicates because they represent different dishes
  with distinct ingredients and preparations. A "Chicken Caesar Salad" is a specific
  type of salad that includes chicken, romaine lettuce, croutons, parmesan cheese,
  and Caesar dressing, whereas "Grilled Chicken" refers to any dish where chicken
  has been cooked on a grill, which can be served in various ways and combined with
  other ingredients.'
