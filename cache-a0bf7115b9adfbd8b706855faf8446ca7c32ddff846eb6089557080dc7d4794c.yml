text: No, they should not be merged. While both 'A2 Butter' and 'Lactose-free Butter'
  are types of butter, they have distinct characteristics. 'A2 Butter' is a specific
  type of butter based on the A2 beta-casein protein, while 'Lactose-free Butter'
  is a type of butter that has been processed to remove lactose. These differences
  make them separate instances in terms of semantics and ontology.
