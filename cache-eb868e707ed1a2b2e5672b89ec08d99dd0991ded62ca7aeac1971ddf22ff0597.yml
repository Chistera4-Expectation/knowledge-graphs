text: No, Fried onions and Scallions should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both types of onions, they have distinct characteristics
  and uses in cooking. Fried onions are typically prepared by slicing or chopping
  onions, then frying them in oil or butter until they are brown and crispy. Scallions,
  also known as green onions or spring onions, are a type of onion with long green
  leaves and a milder flavor than other onions. They can be eaten raw or cooked and
  are often used as a garnish or in salads, soups, and stir-fries.
