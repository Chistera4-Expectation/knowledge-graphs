text: No, these instances should not be merged together. While both are related to
  water, they serve different purposes and have distinct properties. Sparkling water
  is a carbonated beverage, while water for egg wash is used for coating food before
  cooking. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.
