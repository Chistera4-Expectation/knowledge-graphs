text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Water' and 'Well Water'
  are types of drinking water, they have distinct characteristics and sources. 'Water'
  refers to the general term for drinking water, while 'Well Water' specifically refers
  to water drawn from a well. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences
  in their properties and origins.
