text: ' The most adequate class for groundnuts would be "Edible Seeds." Groundnuts,
  also known as peanuts, are seeds that grow underground and are rich in nutrients
  like healthy fats, protein, fiber, and various vitamins and minerals. They belong
  to the same family as other edible seeds such as sunflower seeds, sesame seeds,
  and flaxseeds.'
