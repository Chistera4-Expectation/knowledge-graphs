text: No, 'Orange juice' and 'Pineapple juice' are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  They are distinct types of juice derived from different fruits, with different nutritional
  profiles and flavors. Although they both fall under the broader category of "juice,"
  they should not be merged together as the same instance.
