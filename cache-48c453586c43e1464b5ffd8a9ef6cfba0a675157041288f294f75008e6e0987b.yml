text: No, Peanut Oil and Safflower Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  properties, nutritional profiles, and uses. Peanut Oil is derived from peanuts and
  has a nutty flavor, while Safflower Oil comes from the seeds of the safflower plant
  and is known for its high smoke point and neutral flavor. Merging them would not
  accurately represent their unique characteristics.
