text: No, the instances 'Ghost Shrimp' and 'Shrimp' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although both are crustaceans and members
  of the shrimp family, they are distinct species with different characteristics,
  appearances, and behaviors. 'Ghost Shrimp' refers specifically to certain species
  within the Palaemonetes genus, while 'Shrimp' is a more general term encompassing
  a broader range of crustaceans.
