text: ' No. Corn oil and soybean oil are two different types of edible vegetable oils,
  each with their own unique nutritional profiles and uses. While they may share some
  similarities as members of the same broader category, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. It is important to maintain
  distinctions between individual items within a category, especially when those items
  have distinct characteristics and properties.'
