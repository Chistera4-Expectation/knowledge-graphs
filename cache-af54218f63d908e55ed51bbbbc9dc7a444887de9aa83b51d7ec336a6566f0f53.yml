text: No, they should not be merged as they are two distinct food items made from
  Guinea fowl. Guinea Fowl Meatballs are a dish made by combining ground Guinea fowl
  meat with other ingredients, while Guinea Fowl Stock is a liquid made by simmering
  Guinea fowl bones, vegetables, and herbs to extract flavor and nutrients. They serve
  different purposes in cooking and have different nutritional profiles.
