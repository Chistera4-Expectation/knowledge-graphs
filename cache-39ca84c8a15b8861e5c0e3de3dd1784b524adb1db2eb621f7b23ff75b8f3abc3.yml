  The two instances, "Roasted red bell peppers, diced" and "Sliced green onions,"
  are not identical in their preparation methods (roasting vs. slicing) and ingredients
  (bell peppers vs. green onions), making them different culinary entities. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
