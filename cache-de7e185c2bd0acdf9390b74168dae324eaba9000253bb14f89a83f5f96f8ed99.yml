text: No, the instances 'Hedgehog Mushroom' and 'Lion's Mane Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong
  to the edible mushroom class, they are different species with distinct characteristics,
  appearances, and nutritional properties. Hedgehog mushrooms (Hydnum repandum) have
  a spiny underside, while Lion's Mane mushrooms (Hericium erinaceus) have cascading
  icicle-like growths. Merging them would create confusion and inaccuracies in the
  classification of these unique mushroom species.
