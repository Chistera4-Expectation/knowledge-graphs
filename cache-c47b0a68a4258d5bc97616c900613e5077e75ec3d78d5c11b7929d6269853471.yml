    content: "Creating a list of instances for a class named `Rice` depends on the\
      \ aspects we are focusing on. For a simple example, I'll consider some basic\
      \ properties a `Rice` class might have, such as `name`, `type` (e.g., long grain,\
      \ short grain, basmati, jasmine, etc.), and `cookingTime`. \n\nSince I'm programming\
      \ language-agnostic at this moment, I'll show you how you could define such\
      \ a class in Python,"
