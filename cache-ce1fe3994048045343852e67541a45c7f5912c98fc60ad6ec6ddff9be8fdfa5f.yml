text: As a dietician, my expertise lies in nutrition and not in computer science or
  ontology. However, from a nutritional perspective, while both seasoning cubes and
  seasonings for filling may contain similar ingredients, they serve different purposes
  in cooking. Seasoning cubes are typically used to flavor soups, stews, or sauces,
  whereas seasonings for filling are used to add flavor to a filling, such as for
  stuffed vegetables or pastries. Therefore, even though they share some similarities,
  they serve distinct purposes in cooking and are not strictly duplicates.
