  Although both brown rice and rice paper wrappers are made from rice, they serve
  different purposes in cooking and have distinct nutritional profiles. Brown rice
  is a whole grain that can be consumed on its own or used in various dishes for added
  nutrition and texture. On the other hand, rice paper wrappers are thin sheets typically
  used to make spring rolls or wraps and do not provide significant nutritional value
  compared to brown rice. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two
  instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
