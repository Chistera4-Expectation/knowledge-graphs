text: ' No. Corn masa and cornstarch are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged. Although both are made from corn, they have different
  processing methods and uses. Corn masa is made by treating dried corn with an alkaline
  solution to break down its cell walls, while cornstarch comes from grinding the
  endosperm of corn kernels into a fine powder. They also serve distinct culinary
  purposes: corn masa is used primarily for making tortillas and other Latin American
  dishes, whereas cornstarch acts as a thickening agent in various recipes.'
