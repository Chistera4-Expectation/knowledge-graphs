  While both "Guinea Fowl Nuggets" and "Pheasant Nuggets" are nuggets made from poultry,
  they are made from different types of poultry, and therefore, have distinct nutritional
  profiles and culinary characteristics. Maintaining them as separate instances allows
  for more accurate and precise information about each type of poultry-derived food.
