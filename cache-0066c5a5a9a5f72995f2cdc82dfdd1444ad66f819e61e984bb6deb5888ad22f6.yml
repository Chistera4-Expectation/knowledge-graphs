text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both "Ostrich Sausage" and "Ostrich" are derived from the same animal, they are
  distinct food items with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. "Ostrich
  Sausage" refers to a processed food item made from ostrich meat, while "Ostrich"
  refers to the unprocessed meat itself. Therefore, they should remain as separate
  instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
