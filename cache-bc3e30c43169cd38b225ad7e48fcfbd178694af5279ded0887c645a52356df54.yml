  While both "dipping sauce" and "hot sauce" can be used for flavoring food, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct purposes and uses.
  Dipping sauces are typically used as an accompaniment to foods like fries, wings,
  or dumplings, allowing you to dip each bite into the sauce before consuming it.
  Hot sauces, on the other hand, are primarily added to dishes during cooking or at
  the table to impart heat and spice. Merging them would disregard their unique roles
  in culinary contexts.'
