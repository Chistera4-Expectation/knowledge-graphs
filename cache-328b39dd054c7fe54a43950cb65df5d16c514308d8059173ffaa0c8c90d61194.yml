text: No, Apricot Kernel Oil and Flaxseed Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct types of edible vegetable oils with
  different compositions, properties, and uses. While both oils can be used in cooking
  and have some overlapping health benefits, they are derived from different plant
  sources and have unique characteristics.
