text: No, Enoki mushrooms and Oyster mushrooms should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the Edible Mushrooms class, they
  are different species with distinct characteristics and uses. Enoki mushrooms (Flammulina
  velutipes) have long, thin stems and small caps, and are commonly used in Asian
  cuisine. Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus), on the other hand, have fan-shaped
  caps and are often used in European and American dishes. Merging these two species
  would result in the loss of valuable information and distinction between the two
  types of mushrooms.
