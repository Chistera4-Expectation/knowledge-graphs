text: No, these instances should not be merged together as they are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates. Chinese five-spice powder and Kashmiri chili powder are
  distinct spice blends with different flavor profiles and ingredients. Chinese five-spice
  powder typically consists of star anise, cloves, cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel
  seeds, while Kashmiri chili powder is made from dried Kashmiri chilies, which have
  a mild heat and a deep red color.
