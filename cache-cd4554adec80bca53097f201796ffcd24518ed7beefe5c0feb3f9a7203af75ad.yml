text: ' No. Dry Marsala wine and Shaoxing wine are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  despite both being types of alcoholic drinks. They have distinct origins, flavors,
  uses, and cultural significance. Merging them would result in loss of important
  distinctions between these unique wines.'
