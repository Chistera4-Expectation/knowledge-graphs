text: No, 'Fresh Basil' and 'Fresh Parsley' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are two different herbs with distinct flavors,
  appearances, and uses in cooking. While they are both members of the Edible Vegetable
  class, they represent unique entities within that class.
