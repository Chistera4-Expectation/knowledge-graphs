text: ' No. While both "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Chicken Breasts" are related to
  poultry, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. A chicken caesar salad
  is a dish that contains various ingredients including chicken breasts, whereas chicken
  breasts refer specifically to the breast meat of a chicken without any added components.
  Therefore, these two instances represent distinct concepts within the context of
  poultry-derived food.'
