text: No, Amaranth Seeds and Hemp Seeds should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both edible seeds and have some nutritional similarities,
  they have distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and uses. Merging them
  would disregard their unique properties and could lead to confusion for those seeking
  information about these specific seeds.
