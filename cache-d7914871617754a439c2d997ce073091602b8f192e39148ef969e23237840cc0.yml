text: As a dietician, my role is not to determine the merging of instances in a specific
  classification system. However, from a semantic and ontological perspective, if
  'A2 Butter' and 'Butter Blend' have the same meaning and properties, they can be
  considered duplicates and could potentially be merged. The final decision would
  depend on the specific classification system or database in question.
