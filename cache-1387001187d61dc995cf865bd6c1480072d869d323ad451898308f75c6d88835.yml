  While both kiwi seeds and sesame seeds are indeed edible seeds, they belong to different
  botanical families (Actinidiaceae and Pedaliaceae respectively) and have distinct
  nutritional profiles, health benefits, culinary uses, and cultural significance.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates from the perspective of a dietitian specializing in edible seeds.'
