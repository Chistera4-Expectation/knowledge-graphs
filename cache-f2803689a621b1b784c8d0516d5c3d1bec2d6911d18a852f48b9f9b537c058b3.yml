text: No, Artisanal Water and Electrolyte Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  characteristics and purposes. Artisanal Water is typically sourced from natural
  springs and may be marketed for its unique mineral content or taste, while Electrolyte
  Water is specifically formulated to contain electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium,
  and magnesium) to help replenish fluids and electrolytes lost during exercise or
  illness. Merging these two concepts would result in a loss of specificity and clarity
  in the classification system.
