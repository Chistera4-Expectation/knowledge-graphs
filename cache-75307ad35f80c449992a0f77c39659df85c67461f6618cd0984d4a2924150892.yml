text: No, the instances 'Mushrooms' and 'Shiitake Mushroom' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Mushrooms' is a general term for the edible
  fungi group, while 'Shiitake Mushroom' is a specific type of mushroom. They have
  different characteristics, nutritional values, and uses, so they should be kept
  as separate instances within the Edible Mushrooms class.
