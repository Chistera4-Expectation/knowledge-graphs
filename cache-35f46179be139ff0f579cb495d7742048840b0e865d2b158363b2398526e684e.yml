text: No, Turkey Broth and Turkey Drumsticks should not be merged together as they
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Turkey Broth is a liquid derived from
  cooking turkey, while Turkey Drumsticks are a specific cut of meat from the turkey
  leg. These two instances represent different food products and should be kept separate
  in a Poultry-derived Food class.
