text: ' No. Linden honey and strawberry honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Although they are both types of honey, they come from different botanical sources
  (linden trees vs strawberries) and therefore have distinct characteristics such
  as flavor, color, and nutritional profile. Therefore, it is important to keep them
  separate and maintain their individual identities.'
