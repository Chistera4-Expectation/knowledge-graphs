text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  distilled water and rainwater are considered purified water, they have different
  origins and processes. Distilled water is produced by boiling water and condensing
  the steam, which leaves behind impurities. Rainwater, on the other hand, is water
  that falls from the sky, and while it may be naturally purified, it can still contain
  impurities depending on the environment and air quality. Therefore, they are not
  exact duplicates in terms of semantics and ontology.
