  Bean sprouts and black beans are two different vegetables with distinct nutritional
  profiles and ontological categories. While they are both beans, they have different
  culinary uses, health benefits, and biochemical compositions. Merging them as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates would not accurately reflect the distinct identities of
  these vegetables.'
