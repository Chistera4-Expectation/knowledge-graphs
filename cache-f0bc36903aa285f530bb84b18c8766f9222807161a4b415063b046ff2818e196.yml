  While both grain-finished beef and grass-fed beef are types of beef, they differ
  significantly in terms of their nutritional content, production methods, and taste.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Grain-finished beef typically comes from cattle that are fed grains like corn and
  soy during the last few months of their lives, resulting in a higher fat marbling
  and a richer flavor. On the other hand, grass-fed beef comes from cattle that have
  been raised solely on pasture and consume only grasses and forages throughout their
  entire life cycle, which tends to produce leaner meat with a different flavor profile.
  As such, these two categories serve distinct purposes within the broader classification
  of beef products.'
