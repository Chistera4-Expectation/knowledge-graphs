  While both chicken tacos and chicken wings are made from poultry, they differ significantly
  in terms of ingredients, preparation methods, nutritional content, cultural contexts,
  and consumption occasions. Therefore, it would not be accurate to merge them as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. They belong to different food categories within
  the broader domain of poultry-derived foods.'
