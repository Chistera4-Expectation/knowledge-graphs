text: ' The most adequate class for bell peppers would be "Edible Vegetables." Bell
  peppers are a type of vegetable that is widely consumed and known for its various
  health benefits. They belong to the family of fruits called capsicum, but in common
  language and culinary usage, they are considered vegetables. Other classes such
  as food seasonings or sauces might include bell peppers as an ingredient, but on
  their own, they fall under the category of edible vegetables.'
