  The two instances, "Boneless, skinless chicken breasts" and "Fried chicken," are
  not identical in their preparation methods, taste, texture, and nutritional content.
  Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are lean protein with lower calories and fat
  compared to fried chicken, which is deep-fried and has a crispy exterior and a juicy
  interior, with higher calories and fat content. They can be considered related but
  distinct entities within the poultry-derived food category. Therefore, they shouldn''t
  be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
