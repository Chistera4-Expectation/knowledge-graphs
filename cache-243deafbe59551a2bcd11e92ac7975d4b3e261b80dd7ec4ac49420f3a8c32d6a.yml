  While both chicken nuggets and fried chicken are poultry-derived foods, they have
  distinct preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Chicken nuggets typically
  consist of processed chicken meat formed into small pieces and often coated with
  batter or breadcrumbs before being deep-fried. On the other hand, fried chicken
  involves whole cuts of chicken (such as breasts, thighs, or wings) that are coated
  in seasoned flour and then deep-fried until crispy on the outside and cooked through
  on the inside. These differences in ingredients, processing, and cooking techniques
  warrant them to be treated as separate food items rather than merging them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
