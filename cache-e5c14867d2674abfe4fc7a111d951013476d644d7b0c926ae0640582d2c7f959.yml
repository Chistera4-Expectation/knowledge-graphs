text: ' No. Feta cheese and mascarpone cheese are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While both are types of cheese, they have distinct
  characteristics, origins, textures, flavors, uses, and nutritional profiles. Therefore,
  it is essential to maintain them as separate instances for accurate representation
  and understanding in any classification system or knowledge graph.'
