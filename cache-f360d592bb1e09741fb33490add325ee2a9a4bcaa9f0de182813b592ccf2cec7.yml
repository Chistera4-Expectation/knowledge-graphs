  As a dietitian in the cheese class, I can confirm that "sugar per serving" and "vitamin
  A content per serving" are not semantic or ontological duplicates. These two properties
  refer to different nutritional aspects of food items: one is related to carbohydrate
  content (sugars), while the other concerns fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A). Merging
  them would result in loss of essential information about the nutritional profile
  of cheeses.'
