  Although both are derived from chicken, they represent different cuts of meat with
  varying nutritional profiles, textures, and cooking methods. "Boneless chicken"
  can refer to various parts of the chicken without bones, while "chicken breast"
  specifically refers to the breast meat of the chicken.
