text: Yes, based on the information provided, 'Glacier Water' and 'Water' can be considered
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates since both represent the same substance, which
  is H2O. However, in a real-world scenario, 'Glacier Water' could be considered as
  a specific type of water, such as bottled or filtered water, with additional characteristics
  like being sourced from glaciers and potentially having a unique taste or mineral
  content. In this case, they would not be considered as exact duplicates. It would
  depend on the context and how the entities are defined and used within the system.
