text: As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on the nutritional value and culinary
  aspects of these crustaceans. However, I am not an expert in semantics or ontology.
  From a dietary perspective, crabs and rock crabs are indeed both crustaceans and
  share many similarities in terms of nutritional content. However, they may have
  differences in taste, texture, and culinary applications. Therefore, from a dietary
  standpoint, they should not be merged as duplicates. To provide a definitive answer
  on semantics and ontology, it is best to consult with an expert in those fields.
