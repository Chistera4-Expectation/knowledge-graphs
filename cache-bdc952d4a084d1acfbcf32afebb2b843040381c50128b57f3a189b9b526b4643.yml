text: No, Japonica Rice and Sticky Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they share some similarities, they are distinct
  types of rice with different characteristics and uses. Japonica Rice is a subspecies
  of Oryza sativa, and it is generally short-grained, sticky, and commonly used in
  Japanese cuisine. Sticky Rice, also known as glutinous rice, is another type of
  rice with a high amylopectin content, which gives it a sticky texture. It is commonly
  used in Southeast Asian and East Asian cuisines. Although they can be used interchangeably
  in some dishes, they are not the same type of rice and have distinct properties.
