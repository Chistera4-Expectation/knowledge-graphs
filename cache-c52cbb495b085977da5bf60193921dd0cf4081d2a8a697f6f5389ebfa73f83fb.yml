text: No, Mineral Water and Spring-fed Water should not be merged together as they
  have distinct characteristics. Mineral Water typically contains a higher concentration
  of dissolved minerals, whereas Spring-fed Water is sourced from an underground aquifer
  and may or may not contain significant amounts of minerals. While there can be some
  overlap between the two categories, they are not exact duplicates.
