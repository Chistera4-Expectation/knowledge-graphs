text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of drinking water, they
  have distinct differences in composition and preparation. Infused water typically
  contains added ingredients like fruits, vegetables, or herbs, while tap water is
  simply water from a public water supply. Merging them would not accurately represent
  the distinct qualities and uses of each type of water.
