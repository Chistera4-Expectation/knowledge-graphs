  Blackberry honey and comb honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates despite
  both being types of honey. Blackberry honey is made from the nectar of blackberry
  flowers while comb honey is pure honey that includes the wax cells built by honeybees
  to store it. They have different compositions and characteristics, so they should
  remain separate even though they belong to the same general category.'
