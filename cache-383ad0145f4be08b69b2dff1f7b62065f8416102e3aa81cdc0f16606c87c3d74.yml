text: ' No. Basmati rice and cooked rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While basmati is a type of rice that can be cooked, it has different nutritional
  values, taste, texture, and culinary uses compared to other types of rice before
  cooking. Cooking changes the physical properties of rice grains regardless of their
  variety; therefore, "cooked rice" refers to any rice variety after being prepared
  through cooking, which makes it distinct from its dried form (e.g., raw basmati
  rice). Merging them would lead to confusion and loss of essential information about
  each instance.'
