text: ' No, apple seeds and sesame seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of seeds, they come from different
  plants (apples and sesame, respectively) and have different nutritional profiles
  and uses. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entities with
  distinct properties and characteristics.'
