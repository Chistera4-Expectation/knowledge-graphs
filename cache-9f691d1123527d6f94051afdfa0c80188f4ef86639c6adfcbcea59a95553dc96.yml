text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of tea. Ceylon Tea
  typically refers to black tea from Sri Lanka, while Infused Tea refers to any tea
  that has been steeped with additional ingredients, such as herbs or spices. While
  they both fall under the general category of tea, they are different in terms of
  type, origin, and preparation.
