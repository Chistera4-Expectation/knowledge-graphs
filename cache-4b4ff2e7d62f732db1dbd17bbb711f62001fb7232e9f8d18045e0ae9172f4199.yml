text: ' No. Although buttermilk and condensed milk are both types of milk, they have
  different properties and uses, so they should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Buttermilk is a thin, tangy liquid that is left over after churning
  butter from cream, while condensed milk is a thick, sweetened product made by removing
  water from milk and adding sugar.'
