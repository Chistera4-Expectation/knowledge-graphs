text: No, Cremini and Enoki mushrooms should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible mushrooms, they belong to different
  species and have distinct nutritional profiles, appearances, and culinary uses.
  Cremini mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) are brown and have a firmer texture, while
  Enoki mushrooms (Flammulina velutipes) are long and thin with a delicate texture.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each mushroom.
