text: ' No, Catfish and Swordfish should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both types of fish, they belong to different biological
  families (Ictaluridae for catfish and Xiphiidae for swordfish) and have different
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and environmental impacts. Therefore, it is
  important to maintain separate categories for these two types of edible fish.'
