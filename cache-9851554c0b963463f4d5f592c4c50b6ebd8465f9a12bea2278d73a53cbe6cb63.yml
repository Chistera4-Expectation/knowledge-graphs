text: No, the instances 'Focaccia Bread' and 'White Bread' should not be merged together
  as they have distinct characteristics and ingredients. While both are types of bread,
  focaccia bread is an Italian flatbread typically made with olive oil and herbs,
  whereas white bread is a general term for bread made from wheat flour with a lighter
  color and less bran and germ. They can be considered as subcategories of the Bread
  class, but they should not be merged as duplicates.
