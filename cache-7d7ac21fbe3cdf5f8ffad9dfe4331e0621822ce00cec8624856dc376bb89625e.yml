  While buttermilk and evaporated milk may both belong to the broader category of
  dairy products and more specifically to the subcategory of milk, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. They have distinct properties, uses, and production methods
  that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep these
  two concepts separate.'
