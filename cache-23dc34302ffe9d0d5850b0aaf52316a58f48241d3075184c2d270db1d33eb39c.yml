text: No, Soda Bread and Whole Wheat Bread should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both types of bread, they have distinct ingredients and
  nutritional profiles. Soda Bread uses baking soda as a leavening agent, while Whole
  Wheat Bread uses whole wheat flour, which provides more fiber and nutrients. Merging
  these two would result in a loss of important information about their unique characteristics
  and nutritional benefits.
