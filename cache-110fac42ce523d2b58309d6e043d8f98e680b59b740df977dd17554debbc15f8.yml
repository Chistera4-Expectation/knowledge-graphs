  While both fresh chili peppers and peppers (which typically refer to bell peppers)
  belong to the same family (Capsicum), they are different types of vegetables with
  distinct flavors, uses, and nutritional profiles. Fresh chili peppers tend to be
  spicy and are often used for adding heat to dishes, while bell peppers have a milder
  taste and can range from sweet to bitter depending on their color. Merging them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates would not accurately represent these differences.'
