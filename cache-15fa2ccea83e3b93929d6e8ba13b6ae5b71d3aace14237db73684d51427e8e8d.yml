text: No, the instances 'Duck Drumsticks' and 'Duck Soup' should not be merged as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both involve duck meat, they are distinct
  food items with different preparation methods and uses. Duck drumsticks are a specific
  cut of meat, whereas duck soup is a dish made from various ingredients, including
  duck meat. They are not interchangeable and serve different purposes in a dietician's
  classification of poultry-derived foods.
