text: ' No. Sushi rice and wild rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged together. They belong to different categories of rice and have
  distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Sushi rice is a type of short-grain
  white rice that is typically used for making sushi, while wild rice is a long-grain
  marsh grass seed that has a nuttier flavor and chewier texture than most other types
  of rice.'
