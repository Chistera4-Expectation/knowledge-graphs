text: ' No. Black pepper and Scotch bonnet peppers are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While they are both types of spices, they belong to different taxonomic
  categories (genus and species) and have distinct flavors, uses, and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entities within
  a well-organized culinary or nutrition-related classification system.'
