text: ' No. While pork ribs and pork shoulder are both cuts of meat that come from
  pigs, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to distinct
  parts of the animal and have different culinary uses. Merging them would result
  in loss of important distinctions and could lead to confusion.'
