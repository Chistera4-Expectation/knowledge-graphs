text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both "Ostrich Drumsticks" and
  "Ostrich Gizzards" are derived from ostriches and are part of the poultry-derived
  food class, they are different cuts of meat with distinct characteristics, nutritional
  values, and cooking methods. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances
  in the ontology.
