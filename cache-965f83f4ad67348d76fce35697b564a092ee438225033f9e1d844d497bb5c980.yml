  While "cooked rice" and "long grain white rice" may seem similar, they are not semantically
  and ontologically equivalent. Cooking is a process that can be applied to many types
  of grains, including long-grain white rice, but also brown rice, wild rice, basmati
  rice, jasmine rice, etc. Therefore, cooked rice refers generally to any type of
  rice that has been cooked, while long grain white rice specifically refers to a
  particular variety of unmilled rice with long kernels and a starchy composition.
  Merging these two instances would result in loss of important distinctions between
  different types of rice products.'
