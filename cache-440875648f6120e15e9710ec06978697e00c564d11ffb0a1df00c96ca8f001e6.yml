  While both vegetable broth and other vegetables are related to the general category
  of edible vegetables, they serve different purposes in a person''s diet and have
  distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. It is important to maintain separate categories
  for each type of food item to accurately represent their unique characteristics
  and uses.'
