text: ' The most appropriate class for ''Smoothies'' would be ''Edible Fruit''. Smoothies
  typically contain fruits, vegetables, and sometimes other ingredients like seeds
  or milk. They are often blended together to create a liquid consistency that is
  nutritious and delicious. Some common fruit options for smoothies include berries,
  bananas, mangoes, and pineapples. However, you can also add in veggies such as spinach
  or kale for extra nutrition. Additionally, nuts and seeds can provide an added boost
  of protein and healthy fats. Finally, dairy products like yogurt or milk can help
  thicken the texture and provide calcium. Overall, smoothies are a versatile way
  to incorporate more fruits into your daily diet while still enjoying a tasty treat.'
