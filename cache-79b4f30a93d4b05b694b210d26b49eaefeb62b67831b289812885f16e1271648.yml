text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both "Chicken Nuggets" and
  "Pheasant Nuggets" belong to the Poultry-derived Food class, they are not semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are derived from different types of poultry (chicken
  and pheasant), and the nutritional content and culinary characteristics of the two
  nuggets may vary.
