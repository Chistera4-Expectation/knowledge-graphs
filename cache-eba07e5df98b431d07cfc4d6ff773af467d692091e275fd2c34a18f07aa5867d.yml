  The instances "Zucchini" and "Zucchini, sliced" are not exact duplicates, as they
  represent different forms of the same vegetable. While they share similar nutritional
  properties, their textures and uses in cooking differ. Sliced zucchini may have
  a higher surface area and be more suitable for certain recipes, such as stir-fries
  or salads, while whole zucchinis may be better suited for roasting or grilling.
  Therefore, it is beneficial to keep them separate as distinct instances in the Edible
  Vegetable class.'
