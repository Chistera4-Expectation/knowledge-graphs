text: No, Buffalo Milk and Hemp Milk should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of milk, they are
  derived from different sources and have different nutritional profiles. Buffalo
  Milk is derived from buffalos, while Hemp Milk is derived from hemp seeds. Merging
  them together would not accurately represent the distinct characteristics and properties
  of each type of milk.
