text: ' Larval chips are not suitable as a food item, and they do not fit into any
  healthy or balanced diet. Honey is a more appropriate choice if you want to include
  something natural and nutritious in your diet. However, it should be consumed in
  moderation due to its high sugar content. A better option would be to focus on whole
  foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.'
