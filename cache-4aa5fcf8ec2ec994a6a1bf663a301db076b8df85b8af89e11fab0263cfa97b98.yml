text: No, 'Brown Rice' and 'Glutinous Rice' should not be merged together as they
  have distinct properties and characteristics. Brown rice is a whole grain rice type
  with the bran layer intact, making it higher in fiber and nutrients, while glutinous
  rice has a high starch content, giving it a sticky texture when cooked. These differences
  make them separate entities in terms of semantics and ontology.
