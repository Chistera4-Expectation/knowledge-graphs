text: No, Catfish and Sushi-grade fish should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates in the Edible Fish class. While both are types of fish, they
  serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Catfish is a specific
  species of fish, while Sushi-grade fish refers to fish that is safe and appropriate
  for raw consumption in sushi dishes.
