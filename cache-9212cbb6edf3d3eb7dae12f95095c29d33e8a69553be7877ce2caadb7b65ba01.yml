  While it is true that both "Sugar per serving" and "Trans fat per serving" are related
  to nutrition and health, they refer to different types of nutrients with distinct
  properties and effects on the body. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates.


  Sugar refers to simple carbohydrates that provide quick energy but can also contribute
  to weight gain, tooth decay, and other health issues when consumed in excess. On
  the other hand, Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat that have been linked to
  increased levels of bad cholesterol (LDL) and decreased levels of good cholesterol
  (HDL), which can increase the risk of heart disease.


  Merging these two attributes would not accurately reflect their unique contributions
  to nutrition and health, so it is important to keep them separate.'
