  The instances "Chicken wings" and "chicken sausages" are not identical in terms
  of their composition, preparation method, and nutritional profile. Chicken wings
  are a whole food item that is typically deep-fried or baked, while chicken sausages
  are a processed meat product made from ground chicken meat mixed with various ingredients
  like seasonings, fillers, and preservatives. They belong to different categories
  of poultry-derived foods and can be considered distinct entities in the context
  of a healthy diet. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
