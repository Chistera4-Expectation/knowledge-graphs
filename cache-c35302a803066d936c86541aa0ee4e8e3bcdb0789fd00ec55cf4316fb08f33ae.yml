  While peanut oil and soybean oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct properties and uses, making them separate concepts from an ontological
  perspective. Peanut oil is extracted from peanuts (also known as groundnuts), while
  soybean oil comes from soybeans. They differ in taste, nutritional content, and
  smoke points, which affect their suitability for various culinary applications.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two terms as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.'
