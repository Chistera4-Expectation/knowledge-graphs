text: 'No, they should not be merged. Although both instances are related to cheese,
  they have different purposes and characteristics. "Optional: additional cheese for
  topping" is a possible topping for a dish, while "Ricotta cheese" is a specific
  type of cheese with its own distinct properties. Merging them would result in a
  loss of information and clarity in the ontology.'
