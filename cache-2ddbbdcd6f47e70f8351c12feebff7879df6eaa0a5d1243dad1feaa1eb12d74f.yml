text: No, they should not be merged. While both 'Sauce' and 'Tomato sauce' are related,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. 'Sauce' is a broader term that
  includes various types of sauces, whereas 'Tomato sauce' is a specific type of sauce
  made from tomatoes. They have distinct properties and uses, so they should be treated
  as separate entities.
