  While both "cholesterol per serving" and "total fat per serving" are related to
  nutrition and health, they measure different things and provide distinct information
  about cheese. Cholesterol is a type of lipid that can contribute to heart disease
  when consumed in excess, while total fat includes various types of fats (saturated,
  monounsaturated, polyunsaturated) with differing impacts on health. Therefore, it
  is important for these two attributes to remain separate for accurate nutritional
  labeling and informed decision-making by consumers.'
