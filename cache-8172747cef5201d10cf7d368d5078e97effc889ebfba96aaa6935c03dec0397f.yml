  The two concepts serve different purposes: "quantity of juice" refers to the amount
  of juice present in a container (a numerical value), while "juice" is a more general
  term that can refer to both the liquid itself and its various types (e.g., orange
  juice, apple juice). Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.'
