text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both Pork Cutlet and Pork Roast are derived from pork, they are different types
  of dishes with distinct preparation methods and possibly different nutritional profiles.
  Pork Cutlet is typically breaded and fried, while Pork Roast is cooked by roasting
  the meat in an oven or over a spit.
