text: No, "Goat meat" and "Quail meat" should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of meat derived from different animals. Goat meat comes from goats, while
  quail meat comes from quails. These two types of meat have different nutritional
  profiles and are typically used in different culinary contexts.
