text: ' No. Ice water and infused water are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. While both types of drinks involve water,
  they differ in their properties and uses. Ice water is simply water that has been
  cooled by adding ice to it, while infused water involves flavoring water with various
  ingredients such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, or spices for added taste and potential
  health benefits. Therefore, they belong to different categories and serve distinct
  purposes.'
