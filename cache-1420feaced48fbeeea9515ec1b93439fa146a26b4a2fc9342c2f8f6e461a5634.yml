text: No, Almond Milk and Soy Milk should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of plant-based milk with different nutritional profiles, production methods,
  and potential allergen considerations. While they may both be classified under the
  broader category of "milk alternatives," they are not duplicates in terms of their
  unique characteristics and uses.
