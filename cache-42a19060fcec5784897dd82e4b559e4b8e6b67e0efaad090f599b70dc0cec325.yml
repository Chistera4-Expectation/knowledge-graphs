text: No, Almond Oil and Peanut Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct chemical compositions, properties, and uses. Merging them would lead to
  a loss of important information and could cause confusion for users.
