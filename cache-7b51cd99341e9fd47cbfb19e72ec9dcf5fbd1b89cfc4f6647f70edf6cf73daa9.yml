  While "cooked rice" is a specific type of rice that has been prepared by cooking,
  it is not a semantic or ontological duplicate of "rice." The term "rice" refers
  to the grain crop that is the staple food for more than half of the world''s population,
  while "cooked rice" specifically refers to cooked and ready-to-eat grains of this
  crop. Therefore, these two terms have different meanings and uses, even though they
  are related concepts.'
