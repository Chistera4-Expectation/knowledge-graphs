text: No, Chamomile Tea and Darjeeling Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates because they are different types of tea with distinct characteristics,
  flavors, and health benefits. Chamomile tea is made from the dried flowers of the
  chamomile plant and is known for its calming effects, while Darjeeling tea is a
  black tea grown in the Darjeeling region of India and has a distinct muscatel flavor.
  Although they are both types of tea, they have unique properties and should be considered
  separate instances.
