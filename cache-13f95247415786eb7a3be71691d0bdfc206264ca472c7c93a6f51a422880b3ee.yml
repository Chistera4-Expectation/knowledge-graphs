text: No, Feta cheese and Goat cheese should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of cheese, they are made from different
  types of milk (Feta from sheep or goat milk and Goat cheese from goat milk) and
  have distinct flavors and textures. Merging them would not accurately represent
  the differences between the two.
