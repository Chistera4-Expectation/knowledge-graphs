  While both Chicken Parmesan and Chicken Pieces are poultry-derived foods, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to different types of
  chicken dishes with distinct ingredients and preparations.


  Chicken Parmesan is a specific dish that typically consists of breaded and pan-fried
  chicken breast topped with tomato sauce and melted cheese. On the other hand, Chicken
  Pieces can refer to any cut of chicken meat (e.g., breasts, thighs, drumsticks)
  that has been separated into individual portions, which may or may not be prepared
  in various ways. Therefore, these two terms represent unique concepts within the
  Poultry-derived Food class and should not be merged as duplicates.'
