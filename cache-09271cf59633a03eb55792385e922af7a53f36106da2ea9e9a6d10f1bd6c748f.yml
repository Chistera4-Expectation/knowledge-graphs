text: No, these two instances should not be merged as they have distinct properties
  and characteristics. Ciabatta Bread is a specific type of bread made with wheat
  flour, while Gluten-Free Bread is made without wheat flour and is suitable for individuals
  with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Although they both fall under the category
  of bread, they have different properties and are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
