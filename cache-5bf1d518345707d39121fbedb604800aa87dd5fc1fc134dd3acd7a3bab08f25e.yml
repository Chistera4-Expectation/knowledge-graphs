  While both flaxseed oil and peanut oil are types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have different nutritional profiles, properties, and uses, so they should not be
  merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Flaxseed oil is high in omega-3 fatty
  acids, making it suitable for adding to salads or smoothies, while peanut oil has
  a higher smoke point and is often used for frying or sauteing due to its stability
  at high temperatures. Therefore, these two oils serve distinct purposes and cater
  to different culinary needs.'
