text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  oils have a nutty aroma, they are derived from different sources and have unique
  properties and uses. Hazelnut oil is extracted from hazelnuts, while sesame oil
  is extracted from sesame seeds. These differences in origin lead to variations in
  taste, nutritional value, and potential uses in recipes.
