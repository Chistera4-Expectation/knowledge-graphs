text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct types of sauces
  with different ingredients, flavors, and uses. Hoisin sauce is a Chinese condiment
  made from soybeans, while pesto sauce is an Italian sauce typically made from basil,
  garlic, and olive oil. Although they are both sauces, they are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
