text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are sauces, they have
  distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses. Chili sauce is typically made from chili
  peppers, vinegar, and sugar, while Hollandaise sauce is made from butter, egg yolks,
  and lemon juice. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique characteristics
  and uses in a dietary context.
