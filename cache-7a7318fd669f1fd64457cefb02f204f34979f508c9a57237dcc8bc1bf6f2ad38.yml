text: ' No. Blackberry honey and cherry blossom honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they have different taste, color, aroma, and nutritional profiles
  due to their distinct botanical origins. Therefore, it is important to keep them
  separate for accurate food labeling, ingredient sourcing, and consumer information
  purposes.'
