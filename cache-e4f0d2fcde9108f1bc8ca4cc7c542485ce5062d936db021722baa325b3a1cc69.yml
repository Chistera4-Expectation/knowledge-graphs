text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both "Cooking Oil" and "Safflower Oil" are types of edible vegetable oils, they
  are not the same thing. "Cooking Oil" is a general term that refers to any oil used
  for cooking, while "Safflower Oil" is a specific type of edible vegetable oil derived
  from the seeds of the safflower plant. They have different chemical compositions,
  nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking, so they should be treated as distinct
  entities in a classification system.
