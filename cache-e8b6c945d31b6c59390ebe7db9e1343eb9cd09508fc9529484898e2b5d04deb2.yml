text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different food items made
  from the same ingredient (guinea fowl). Guinea Fowl Gravy is a sauce, while Guinea
  Fowl Meatballs are a type of dish with a specific preparation method. They may share
  the same base ingredient, but they are distinct food items with different properties
  and uses.
