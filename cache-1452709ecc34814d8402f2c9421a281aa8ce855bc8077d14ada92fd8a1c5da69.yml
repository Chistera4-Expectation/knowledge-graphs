  Curry powder and garlic powder are not semantic or ontological duplicates, as they
  have distinctly different ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. Curry powder
  is typically a blend of various spices such as turmeric, coriander, cumin, and chili
  peppers, while garlic powder consists solely of dehydrated and ground garlic cloves.
  They serve unique purposes in seasoning food and contribute differently to the overall
  taste and aroma profiles of dishes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  them as duplicates in a Food Seasoning class from either a semantic or an ontological
  perspective.'
