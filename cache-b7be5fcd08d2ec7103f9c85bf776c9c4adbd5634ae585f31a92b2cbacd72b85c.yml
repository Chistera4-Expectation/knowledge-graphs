  Although buckwheat honey and sage honey are both types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics that make them unique from one another. Buckwheat honey is known
  for its strong molasses-like flavor and dark color due to its high mineral content,
  while sage honey has a milder taste and lighter color with a slight hint of sage.
  Merging these two instances would result in loss of important information regarding
  their individual properties and uses.'
