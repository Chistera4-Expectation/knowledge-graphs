text: ' No, apple seeds and sunflower seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of seeds, they come from different
  plants (apples vs sunflowers) and have different nutritional profiles. Therefore,
  it is important to keep them separate when discussing edible seeds.'
