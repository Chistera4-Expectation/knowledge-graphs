text: 'As a dietician, I would not provide a simple yes or no answer to this question
  as it involves semantic and ontological considerations. Instead, I would recommend
  further analysis to determine if the two instances are indeed duplicates or if they
  have unique characteristics that warrant separate categorization.


  Artisanal water typically refers to water sourced from natural springs, which may
  be bottled and marketed based on the unique qualities of the water source. Hydrogen
  water, on the other hand, is water that has been infused with hydrogen gas, which
  is believed to have potential health benefits.


  While both types of water are marketed as having unique qualities, they are distinct
  in their source and composition. Therefore, it would be prudent to maintain separate
  categories for each type of water, allowing for a more accurate understanding of
  their respective properties and potential health benefits.'
