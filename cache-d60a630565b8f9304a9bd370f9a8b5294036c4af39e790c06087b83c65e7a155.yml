text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they both belong to the category
  of sweeteners, they have distinct differences in terms of nutritional value, glycemic
  index, and other properties. Coconut sugar, for example, has a lower glycemic index
  and contains some micronutrients, while white sugar is mostly empty calories. Therefore,
  they should be kept as separate instances in the Sweetener class.
