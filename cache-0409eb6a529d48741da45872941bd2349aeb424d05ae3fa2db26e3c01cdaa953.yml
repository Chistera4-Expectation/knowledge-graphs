  While both "fresh raw fish" and "raw fish" may seem similar, they are not necessarily
  identical in meaning and can have different implications when it comes to consumption
  and nutritional value. Therefore, merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates
  would not accurately reflect their distinct meanings and uses.


  For instance, "fresh raw fish" implies that the fish has been recently caught and
  prepared for consumption without any cooking or preservation methods. This type
  of fish is often used in sushi or ceviche dishes, where its freshness is crucial
  for taste and texture. On the other hand, "raw fish" could refer to any uncooked
  fish, including frozen or previously thawed fish that might not have the same level
  of freshness as "fresh raw fish." Additionally, some types of raw fish may require
  special handling due to potential food safety concerns, while others do not.


  Therefore, maintaining separate categories for "fresh raw fish" and "raw fish" allows
  for more precise communication about the quality and characteristics of the fish
  being discussed.'
