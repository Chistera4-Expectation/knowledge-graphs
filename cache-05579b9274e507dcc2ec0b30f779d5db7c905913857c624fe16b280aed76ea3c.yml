text: No, 'Black Tea' and 'White Tea' should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates, as they are distinct types of tea with different characteristics and
  preparation methods. While both are made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis
  plant, they undergo different processing methods that result in unique flavors,
  aromas, and nutritional profiles.
