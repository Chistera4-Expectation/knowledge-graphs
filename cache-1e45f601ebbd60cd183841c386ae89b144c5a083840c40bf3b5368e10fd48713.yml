text: No, Hemp Milk and Lactose-free milk should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are alternative milk options, they have
  distinct properties and origins. Hemp Milk is made from hemp seeds, while Lactose-free
  milk is made from cow's milk with the lactose removed. They belong to different
  subcategories within the milk class.
