text: ' No. Black rice and Jasmine rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  despite both being types of rice. They differ in terms of their nutritional content,
  taste, texture, appearance, cultural significance, culinary uses, and place of origin
  among other factors. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entities
  with distinct properties and characteristics.'
