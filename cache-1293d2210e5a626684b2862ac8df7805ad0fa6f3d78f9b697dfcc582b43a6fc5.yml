text: No, Guinea Fowl Gravy and Pheasant Gravy should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both gravies derived from poultry, they
  come from different types of poultry (guinea fowl and pheasant, respectively) and
  therefore have distinct characteristics, flavors, and nutritional profiles.
