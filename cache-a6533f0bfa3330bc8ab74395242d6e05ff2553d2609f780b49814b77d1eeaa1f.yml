  The instances "Sliced green onions" and "Zucchini, sliced" are not duplicate entries.
  They represent two different vegetables that have been prepared in a similar way
  (sliced). Each instance represents a unique food item with its own set of nutritional
  properties, flavor profile, and culinary uses. Therefore, they should not be merged
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
