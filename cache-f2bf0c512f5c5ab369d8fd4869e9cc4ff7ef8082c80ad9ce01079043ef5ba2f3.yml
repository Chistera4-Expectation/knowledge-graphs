text: No, they should not be merged together. Oyster mushrooms and Portobello mushrooms
  are different species of mushrooms with distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles,
  and culinary uses. Oyster mushrooms belong to the species Pleurotus ostreatus, while
  Portobello mushrooms are the mature form of Agaricus bisporus, which also includes
  the common white button mushroom and the crimini mushroom. While they share some
  similarities as edible mushrooms, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
