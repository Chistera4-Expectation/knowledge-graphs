text: No, Macadamia Nut Oil and Olive Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both edible vegetal oils, they have distinct properties,
  flavors, and uses in cooking and food preparation. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the differences between the two oils.
