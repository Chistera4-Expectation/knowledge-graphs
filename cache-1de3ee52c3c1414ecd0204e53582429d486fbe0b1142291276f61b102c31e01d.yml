text: No, the instances 'Optional toppings' and 'Seasonings for filling' should not
  be merged as they serve different purposes. 'Optional toppings' refer to additional
  ingredients that can be added on top of the food, while 'Seasonings for filling'
  refer to ingredients that are mixed into the filling of the food. Although they
  both relate to seasoning, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
