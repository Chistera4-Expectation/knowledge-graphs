  Chili powder and five-spice powder are not semantic or ontological duplicates, despite
  both being types of seasonings used in cooking. They have different ingredients
  and uses. Chili powder is typically made from ground dried chilies and may also
  include other spices such as cumin, garlic, oregano, and coriander. It is commonly
  used in Mexican and Southwestern cuisine to add heat and flavor. Five-spice powder,
  on the other hand, is a blend of five spices that usually includes star anise, cloves,
  Chinese cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds. It is frequently used in Chinese
  and Vietnamese dishes for its aromatic properties and complex taste. Therefore,
  they serve distinct purposes in culinary applications and should not be combined
  into one category.'
