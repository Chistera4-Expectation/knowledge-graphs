text: No, Sage Honey and Wildflower Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both types of honey, they come from different floral
  sources, which can affect their taste, aroma, and nutritional content. Sage Honey
  is produced by bees that collect nectar from sage plants, while Wildflower Honey
  is produced by bees that collect nectar from a variety of wildflowers. Maintaining
  these distinctions is important for accurate categorization and information about
  the specific types of honey.
