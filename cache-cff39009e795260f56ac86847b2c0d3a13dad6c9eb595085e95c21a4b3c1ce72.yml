  While both "Saffron threads" and "Saffron" refer to the same spice derived from
  the Crocus sativus flower, they are not exactly the same thing and do have different
  uses in cooking. Saffron refers to the stigmas of the crocus flower, while saffron
  threads specifically refer to the individual strands that are dried and used in
  cooking. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate as distinct instances.'
