text: ' No. While both carbohydrates and sugars are types of carbohydrates and provide
  energy, they have different nutritional implications and metabolic pathways in the
  body. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between them rather than merging
  their values into one attribute. Keeping separate attributes for "carbohydrates
  per serving" and "sugars per serving" allows more accurate tracking and understanding
  of nutrient intake.'
