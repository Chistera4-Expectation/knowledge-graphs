text: No, they should not be merged. Boiling water and distilled water are different
  in their production methods and properties. Boiling water is water that has been
  heated to its boiling point, while distilled water is water that has been purified
  through a distillation process to remove impurities. Although both are purified
  forms of water, they have distinct differences and should not be considered as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates.
