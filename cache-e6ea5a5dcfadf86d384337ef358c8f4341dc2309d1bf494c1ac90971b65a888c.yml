text: ' No. While both Creamy Italian Dressing and Russian Dressing are types of salad
  dressings, they have distinct ingredients and flavors. Creamy Italian Dressing typically
  contains mayonnaise, vinegar, olive oil, garlic, and various herbs and spices for
  an Italian flavor. Russian Dressing, on the other hand, is made with ketchup, mayo,
  wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and chili pepper for a sweet and tangy taste
  with a hint of heat. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic or ontological
  duplicates.'
