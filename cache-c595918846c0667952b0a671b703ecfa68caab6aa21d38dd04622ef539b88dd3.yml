text: No, the instances 'Fat-Free Yogurt' and 'Yogurt' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. While fat-free yogurt is a specific type
  of yogurt, it still differs in nutritional content and characteristics from other
  types of yogurt, such as full-fat or low-fat yogurt. Merging them would result in
  a loss of specificity and potentially cause confusion in dietary recommendations
  or nutritional analysis.
