text: No, the instances 'Ciabatta Bread' and 'Sourdough Bread' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of bread, they
  have distinct ingredients, preparation methods, and characteristics. Merging them
  would result in a loss of specific information and nuance.
