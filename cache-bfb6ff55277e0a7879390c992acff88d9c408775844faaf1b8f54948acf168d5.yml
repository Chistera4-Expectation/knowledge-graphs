text: ' No. Chicken and fried chicken are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While chicken refers to the general category of domesticated bird raised for meat,
  eggs, and feathers, fried chicken is a specific preparation method that involves
  coating the chicken pieces in flour, batter, or breading before deep-frying them.
  Therefore, they represent different concepts within the poultry-derived food class.'
