text: No, the instances 'Rice Rolls' and 'White Rice' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are related to rice, they are distinct
  food items. Rice rolls typically refer to a type of Asian dish that consists of
  rice paper wrappers filled with various ingredients, whereas white rice refers to
  a type of plain cooked rice. The two items have different preparation methods, ingredients,
  and nutritional values.
