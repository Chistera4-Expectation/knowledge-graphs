text: ' No. Calcium content per serving and sodium per serving are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates, even though they both provide information about nutritional
  content of cheese servings. They measure different substances that have distinct
  roles in human health and nutrition, so it is important to maintain them as separate
  properties for accurate representation and comparison of cheeses based on these
  criteria.'
