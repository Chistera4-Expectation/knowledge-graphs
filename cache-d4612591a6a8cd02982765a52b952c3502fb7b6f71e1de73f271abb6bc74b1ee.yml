text: No, they should not be merged together. Baking powder is a chemical leavening
  agent used in baking, while Five Spice Powder is a seasoning blend used for adding
  flavor to dishes. Although both are used for enhancing food, they serve different
  purposes and are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
