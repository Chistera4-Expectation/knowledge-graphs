text: No, they should not be merged together as they represent different types of
  butter with distinct characteristics and uses. Clarified butter is butter with the
  milk solids and water removed, while flavored butter typically refers to butter
  combined with additional ingredients for added flavor. They are not semantic or
  ontologic duplicates.
