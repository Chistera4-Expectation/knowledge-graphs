text: No, 'Turkey Drumsticks' and 'Turkey Wings' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from turkey, they are
  distinct cuts of meat with different nutritional profiles and cooking properties.
  Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and potentially misleading information.
