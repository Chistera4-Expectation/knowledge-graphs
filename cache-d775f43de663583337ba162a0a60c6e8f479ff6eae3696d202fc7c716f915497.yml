  Monk fruit extract is one type of natural low-calorie sweetener, so it would not
  be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates with the broader
  category of "sweeteners." It is important to maintain clear distinctions between
  specific types of sweeteners (such as monk fruit extract) and general categories
  (such as sweeteners).'
