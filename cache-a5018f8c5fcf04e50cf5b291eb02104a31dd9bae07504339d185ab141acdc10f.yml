text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from chicken, they have different nutritional profiles and uses
  in recipes. Chicken broth is a liquid made from simmering chicken bones and meat,
  while chicken drumsticks are a specific part of the chicken with different proportions
  of muscle, fat, and skin. Therefore, they should be considered as distinct instances
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.
