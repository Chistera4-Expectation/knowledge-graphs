text: No, Canola oil and Chili oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties,
  origins, and uses. Canola oil is extracted from rapeseed plants, while chili oil
  is made by infusing vegetable oil with chili peppers. Their flavor profiles, fatty
  acid compositions, and applications in cooking are different as well.
