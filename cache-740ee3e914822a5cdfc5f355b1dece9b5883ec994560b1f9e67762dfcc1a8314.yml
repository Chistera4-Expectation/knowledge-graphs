text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Guinea Fowl Gravy' and 'Guinea Fowl Tenders' are derived from guinea fowl, they
  are different types of food preparations and serve distinct purposes. Gravy is a
  sauce, while tenders are a specific cut of meat. They are not the same thing and
  should not be merged as duplicates.
