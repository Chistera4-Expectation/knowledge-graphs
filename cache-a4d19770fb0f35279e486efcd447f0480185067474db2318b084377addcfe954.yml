text: No, Turkey Meatballs and Turkey Stock should not be merged as they are different
  types of poultry-derived food. Turkey Meatballs are a dish made of ground turkey
  meat, while Turkey Stock is a liquid made by simmering turkey bones, meat, and/or
  vegetables in water. Although they both originate from turkey, their forms and purposes
  are distinct.
