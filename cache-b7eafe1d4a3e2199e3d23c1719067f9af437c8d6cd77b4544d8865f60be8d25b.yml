text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  dark soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce can be used for color, they have distinct
  flavors, ingredients, and uses. Dark soy sauce is made primarily from soybeans,
  wheat, and salt, while Worcestershire sauce contains vinegar, molasses, and anchovies,
  among other ingredients. Their flavors and applications in cooking are quite different.
