text: No, the instances 'King Oyster Mushroom' and 'Velvet Pioppini Mushroom' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall
  under the category of edible mushrooms, they are distinct species with unique characteristics,
  nutritional profiles, and culinary applications. Merging them together would not
  accurately represent the differences between these two mushroom varieties.
