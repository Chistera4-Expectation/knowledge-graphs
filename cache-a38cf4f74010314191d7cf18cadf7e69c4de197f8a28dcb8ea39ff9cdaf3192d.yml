text: ' "Poultry" would be the most appropriate class for Turkey. This is because
  poultry refers to domesticated birds that are raised for their meat or eggs, and
  includes species such as chickens, ducks, geese, and turkeys. Beef and pork, on
  the other hand, refer specifically to the meat of cattle and pigs, respectively.
  Therefore, grouping turkey with beef or pork-derived foods would not accurately
  reflect its culinary classification.'
