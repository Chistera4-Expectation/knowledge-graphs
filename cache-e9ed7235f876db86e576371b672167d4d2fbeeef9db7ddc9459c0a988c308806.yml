text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Pheasant Drumsticks" and
  "Pheasant" are poultry-derived foods, they are different instances. "Pheasant Drumsticks"
  refers to a specific part of the pheasant, while "Pheasant" refers to the entire
  bird. They should be kept as separate instances to maintain clarity and precision
  in the ontology.
