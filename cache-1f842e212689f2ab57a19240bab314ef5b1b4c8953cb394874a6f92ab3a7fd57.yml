text: As a dietician, I would recommend not merging the instances 'Cardamom pods'
  and 'Cardamom' as they are not exactly the same. Cardamom is a spice made from the
  seeds of several plants in the ginger family, while Cardamom pods refer specifically
  to the dried fruit capsules containing the seeds. Although they are closely related,
  they can have slightly different uses and flavors in recipes.
