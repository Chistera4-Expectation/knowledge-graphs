text: ' No. Olive oil and rice bran oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While both are types of edible vegetable oils,
  they have different nutritional profiles, tastes, and uses in cooking. Therefore,
  it is important to maintain them as separate entries in a classification system
  for edible vegetable oils.'
