  While both "Cooked white rice" and "Wild rice" fall under the general category of
  "rice," they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They have distinct nutritional
  profiles, culinary uses, and origins that make them unique from one another. Cooked
  white rice is typically made from refined, short-grain rice varieties and has a
  higher glycemic index compared to wild rice, which is actually a type of grass seed
  with a lower glycemic load and richer nutrient content. Merging these two instances
  would result in loss of important distinctions between the two food items.'
