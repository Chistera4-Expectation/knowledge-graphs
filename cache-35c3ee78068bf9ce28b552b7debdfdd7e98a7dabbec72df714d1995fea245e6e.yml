  While both black pepper and habanero pepper are types of peppers, they have different
  flavors, heat levels, and uses in cooking. Black pepper is milder with a woody,
  sharp flavor and is commonly used as a seasoning for many dishes, while habanero
  pepper is much hotter and has a fruity, citrus-like flavor that is often used to
  add depth and spice to certain dishes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
