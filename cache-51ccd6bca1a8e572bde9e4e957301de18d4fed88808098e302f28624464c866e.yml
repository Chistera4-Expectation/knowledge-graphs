  While both chili oil and pumpkin seed oil are edible vegetable oils, they have different
  ingredients, flavors, uses, and nutritional profiles. Chili oil is typically made
  from vegetable oil (often soybean or sesame) infused with crushed red chilies, garlic,
  and other spices, whereas pumpkin seed oil is pressed solely from roasted pumpkin
  seeds. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
