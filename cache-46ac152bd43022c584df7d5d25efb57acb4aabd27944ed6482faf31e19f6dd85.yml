text: As a dietician, my role is to provide nutritional advice and not to make decisions
  about software classifications. However, as a general perspective, if 'Piri Piri
  sauce' and 'Sriracha sauce' have distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses, they should
  not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. They can be categorized under
  a broader class like 'Spicy Sauces' but should not be considered the same entity.
