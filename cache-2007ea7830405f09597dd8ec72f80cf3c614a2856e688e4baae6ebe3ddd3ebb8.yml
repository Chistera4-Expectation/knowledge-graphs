text: As a dietician, I would suggest that 'Saffron threads' and 'Saffron' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they both
  refer to the same spice, saffron, they represent different forms of the spice. 'Saffron
  threads' refers to the strands of the spice itself, while 'Saffron' could refer
  to the spice in general, including its strands, powders, or extracts. Keeping them
  separate helps to maintain clarity in recipes and ingredient lists.
