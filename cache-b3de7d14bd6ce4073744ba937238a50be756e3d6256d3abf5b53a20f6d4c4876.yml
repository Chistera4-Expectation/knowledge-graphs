  While long-grain rice and sushi rice are both types of rice, they have distinct
  characteristics and uses in cooking that make them non-duplicative in terms of their
  semantics and ontology. Long-grain rice is known for its slender shape and fluffy
  texture when cooked, making it ideal for dishes like pilafs and stir-fries. On the
  other hand, sushi rice has a shorter grain and is sticky when cooked, which makes
  it suitable for rolling into sushi rolls or forming into bite-sized balls called
  "nigiri." Therefore, merging these two concepts would not accurately reflect their
  unique properties and applications.'
