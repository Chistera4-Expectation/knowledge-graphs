text: ' No. Linden honey and sage honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they may both fall under the category of "honey," they have distinct botanical
  origins (linden flowers vs. sage leaves) that give them unique properties and flavors.
  Therefore, it is important to maintain these distinctions for accurate food labeling,
  nutritional information, and consumer understanding.'
