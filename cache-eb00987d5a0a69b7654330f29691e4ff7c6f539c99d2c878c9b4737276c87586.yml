text: No, Black Rice and Parboiled Rice should not be merged together as they are
  different types of rice with distinct nutritional and culinary properties. Black
  Rice is a whole grain rice that is high in antioxidants and has a nutty flavor,
  while Parboiled Rice is partially precooked and easier to digest, but has a different
  texture and taste compared to Black Rice.
