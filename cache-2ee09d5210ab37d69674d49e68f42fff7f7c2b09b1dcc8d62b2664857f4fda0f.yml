text: ' No. Dried red pepper flakes and Scotch bonnet peppers are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates and should not be merged together as they have different
  properties and uses in cooking. Dried red pepper flakes typically consist of crushed
  dried red chili peppers and can vary in heat level, while Scotch bonnet peppers
  are fresh peppers that are known for their fruity, sweet flavor and intense heat.'
