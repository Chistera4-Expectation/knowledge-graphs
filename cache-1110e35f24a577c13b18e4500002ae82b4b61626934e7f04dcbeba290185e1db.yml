text: No, the instances 'Hedgehog Mushroom' and 'Hen of the Woods Mushroom' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both
  belong to the Edible Mushrooms class, they are two distinct species of mushrooms
  with different characteristics and appearances. Hedgehog Mushroom (Hydnum repandum)
  is characterized by its spines on the underside, while Hen of the Woods Mushroom
  (Grifola frondosa) has a fan-like appearance with many small caps. They may share
  some common traits as edible mushrooms, but they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
