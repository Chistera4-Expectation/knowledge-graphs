text: No, these two instances should not be merged together as they represent different
  types of yogurt with distinct characteristics. Fruit-Flavored Yogurt refers to a
  category of yogurt that has added fruit flavoring or fruit pieces, while Icelandic
  Yogurt (also known as Skyr) is a specific type of yogurt originating from Iceland,
  known for its thicker texture and higher protein content.
