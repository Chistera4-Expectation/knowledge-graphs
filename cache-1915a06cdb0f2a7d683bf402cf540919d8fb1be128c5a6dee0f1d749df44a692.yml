text: ' No. Fiber per serving and Trans fat per serving are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They represent different nutritional aspects of cheese: one being a
  type of carbohydrate that promotes digestion and helps prevent heart disease, while
  the other is a type of fat associated with increased risk of heart disease when
  consumed in excess. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions
  between these two distinct nutrients.'
