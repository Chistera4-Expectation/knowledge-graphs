text: ' No. Grape seeds and watermelon seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they belong to different types of fruit and have distinct nutritional profiles.
  Although both can be consumed as edible seeds, they differ in their size, texture,
  taste, and nutrient content. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate
  entries in an "Edible Seeds" class or any similar categorization scheme.'
