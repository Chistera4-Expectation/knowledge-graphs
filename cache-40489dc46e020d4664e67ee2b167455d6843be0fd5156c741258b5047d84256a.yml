text: ' No. While both chopped onions and red onions are types of onions and may have
  some similarities in terms of nutritional content, they differ in their form (whole
  vs. chopped) and variety (red vs. potentially other colors). Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
