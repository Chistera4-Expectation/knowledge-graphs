text: No, they should not be merged together. Lactose-free milk and sheep's milk are
  different types of milk with distinct properties and characteristics. Lactose-free
  milk is regular milk with the lactose (a type of sugar) removed or modified, making
  it easier to digest for individuals with lactose intolerance. Sheep's milk, on the
  other hand, is milk produced by sheep and has a different nutritional profile and
  flavor compared to cow's milk. Although both are classified as milk, they are not
  semantic or ontologic duplicates.
