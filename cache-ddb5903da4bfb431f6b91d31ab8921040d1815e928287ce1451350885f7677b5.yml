text: ' No. While both "roast" and an array of flavor notes can provide information
  about the characteristics of coffee, they represent different aspects and are not
  duplicates. Roast level refers to the degree of heat applied during the roasting
  process, which affects the color, texture, taste, and aroma of coffee beans. On
  the other hand, flavor notes refer to specific tastes and sensory perceptions derived
  from the chemical compounds present in the brewed coffee, often influenced by factors
  such as bean variety, origin, processing method, and preparation technique. Merging
  these two properties would result in loss of distinct and valuable information related
  to the characterization of coffee.'
