text: No, they should not be merged as they serve different purposes. Vegetable Broth
  is a specific type of vegetable-based liquid that can be used as a cooking ingredient
  or standalone dish, while "other vegetables for variation" refers to a variety of
  vegetables that can be added to recipes to introduce different flavors and nutrients.
  They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates, as they have distinct meanings and
  uses.
