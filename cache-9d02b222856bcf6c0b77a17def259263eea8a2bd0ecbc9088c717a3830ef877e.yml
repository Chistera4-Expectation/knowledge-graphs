text: ' No. Idli rice and Sushi rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they may both fall under the broader category of "rice." They have different
  culinary uses, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles, so it is important
  to keep them separate for accurate labeling and categorization purposes.'
