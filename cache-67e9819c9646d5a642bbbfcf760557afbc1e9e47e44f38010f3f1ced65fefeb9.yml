text: As a dietician, I would not recommend merging the instances 'Enchilada sauce'
  and 'Mole sauce' together as they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses in
  recipes. While they both are types of sauces, they have different properties and
  nutritional values, and therefore should be treated as separate entities in a classification
  system.
