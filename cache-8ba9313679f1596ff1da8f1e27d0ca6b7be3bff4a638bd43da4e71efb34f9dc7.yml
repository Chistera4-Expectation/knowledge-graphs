text: ' No. Grated Parmesan cheese and Swiss cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They have different tastes, textures, nutritional profiles, and uses
  in recipes. While they both fall under the broader category of "cheese," merging
  them would result in a loss of important distinctions between these two distinct
  types of cheese.'
