text: No, Gouda cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of cheese, they
  have distinct characteristics, flavors, and textures. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the variety and nuance of cheese types.
