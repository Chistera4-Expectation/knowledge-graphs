  While garlic paste and ginger paste are similar in that they are both food seasonings
  made from pungent plants and used to add flavor to dishes, they have distinct tastes,
  textures, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. They each retain their unique identities within
  the category of food seasonings.'
