text: No, they should not be merged together. Cheddar cheese and Feta cheese are different
  types of cheeses with distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and uses in
  recipes. While they may both be classified under the broader category of cheese,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
