text: ' No. While both dry marsala wine and dry sherry are types of fortified wines,
  they have distinct characteristics and origins that make them different from one
  another. Marsala is produced in Sicily, Italy and has a richer, nuttier flavor profile
  compared to dry sherry which is typically lighter and more crisp. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
