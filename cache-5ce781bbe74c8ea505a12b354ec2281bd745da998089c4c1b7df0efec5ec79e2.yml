text: No, Assam Tea and Ceylon Tea are distinct types of tea and should not be merged
  together. They have different origins (Assam, India vs. Sri Lanka), flavor profiles,
  and growing conditions. While they both fall under the broader category of black
  tea, they should be treated as separate entities in a classification system.
