  Although both "beef" and "beef bones" are related to cattle, they represent different
  food products with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates when
  discussing poultry-derived foods (as your role suggests), since neither involves
  poultry. However, if you were considering merging these terms within a broader meat-related
  category, then the decision would depend on whether you want to maintain separate
  categories for specific parts of an animal versus whole animals.'
