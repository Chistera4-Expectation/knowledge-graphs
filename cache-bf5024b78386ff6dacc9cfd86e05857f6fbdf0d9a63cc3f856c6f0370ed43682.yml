text: No, the instances 'Milk' and 'Sheep's Milk' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Milk' is a general term for the liquid produced
  by mammals, while 'Sheep's Milk' refers specifically to the milk produced by sheep.
  They are distinct types of milk and should be treated as separate instances in a
  class hierarchy.
