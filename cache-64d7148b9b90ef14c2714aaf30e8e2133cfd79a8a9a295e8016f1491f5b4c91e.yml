text: No, Corn Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have different
  chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking and food production.
  Therefore, they should be considered as distinct instances within the Edible Vegetal
  Oil class.
