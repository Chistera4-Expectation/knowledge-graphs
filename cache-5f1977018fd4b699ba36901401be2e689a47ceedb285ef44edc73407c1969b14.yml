text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of drinking water,
  they are different in terms of their properties and production methods. Hydrogen
  water contains added hydrogen molecules, while purified water has undergone a filtration
  process to remove impurities. They serve different purposes and should be treated
  as distinct instances.
