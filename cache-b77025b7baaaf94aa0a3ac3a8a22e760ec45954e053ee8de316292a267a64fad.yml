text: ' No. While both green onions and collard greens are vegetables and share some
  similarities in terms of their nutritional value and culinary uses, they are different
  species and have distinct differences in their flavor, texture, and appearance.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
