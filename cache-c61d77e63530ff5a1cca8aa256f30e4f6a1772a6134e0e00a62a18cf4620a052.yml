  While both baking powder and bouillon powder are food products that can be used
  for seasoning, they serve different purposes and have distinct properties. Baking
  powder is primarily used as a leavening agent to help baked goods rise, while bouillon
  powder is used to add flavor and richness to soups, stews, and other dishes. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
