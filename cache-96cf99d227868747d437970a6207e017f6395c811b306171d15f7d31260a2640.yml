  While poppy seeds and watermelon seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  different nutritional profiles, uses, and culinary properties. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. It is important
  to maintain distinct categories for each type of seed to accurately convey their
  unique characteristics and benefits.'
