text: No, the instances 'Quail Sausage' and 'Quail Stock' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both come from quail, they are
  distinctly different food products with unique nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses. 'Quail Sausage' is a processed meat product, while 'Quail Stock' is a liquid
  extracted from boiled quail bones and/or meat, typically used as a base for soups,
  stews, and sauces.
