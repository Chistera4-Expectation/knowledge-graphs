  While black vinegar and rice vinegar are both types of vinegars used for seasoning
  food, they have different tastes, appearances, and production processes. Black vinegar
  is typically made from fermented grains such as glutinous rice, sorghum, or millet,
  while rice vinegar is made from fermented rice. The aging process also differs between
  the two, resulting in distinct flavors: black vinegar has a richer, more complex
  taste with a hint of sweetness, whereas rice vinegar tends to be lighter, crisper,
  and sometimes mildly acidic. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
