text: No, Basmati Rice and Sushi Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both types of rice, they have different properties and
  uses in cooking. Basmati Rice is a long-grain rice commonly used in Indian and Middle
  Eastern cuisine, whereas Sushi Rice is a short-grain rice specifically used for
  making sushi. Each type of rice has unique characteristics that make it suitable
  for specific dishes, so they should remain separate categories.
