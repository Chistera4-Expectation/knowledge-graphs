text: No, Herbal Tea and Hibiscus Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although Hibiscus Tea is a type of Herbal Tea, they are not the same
  thing. Herbal Tea is a broader category that includes a variety of teas made from
  different herbs and plants, while Hibiscus Tea specifically refers to tea made from
  the hibiscus plant.
