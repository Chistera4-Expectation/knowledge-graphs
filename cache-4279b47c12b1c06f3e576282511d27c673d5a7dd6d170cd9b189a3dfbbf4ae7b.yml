text: As a dietician, I can provide a general perspective on this. 'Lavender Tea'
  and 'Pu-erh Tea' are two distinct types of tea with different flavors, aromas, and
  potential health benefits. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. Each tea type has unique properties that make them different from one
  another.
