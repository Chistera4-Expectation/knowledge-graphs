text: ' No. While both Balsamic Vinegar Dressing and Olive Oil Dressing may contain
  olive oil as an ingredient in some variations, they are distinct food items with
  different dominant flavors and nutritional profiles due to their unique ingredients
  and preparation methods. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic or ontological
  duplicates.'
