text: As a dietician, I can provide insight into the nutritional aspects, but I am
  not an expert in ontology or semantics. However, from a nutritional standpoint,
  'Creamy Yogurt' and 'Lassi Yogurt' are not identical. Creamy Yogurt typically refers
  to a thick, smooth yogurt with a high-fat content, while Lassi Yogurt is a yogurt-based
  drink that may be thinner in consistency and can be sweetened or savory. Although
  they are both yogurt-based, they have distinct characteristics that differentiate
  them. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
