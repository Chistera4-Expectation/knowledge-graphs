text: No, Bluefish and Fish should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although Bluefish is a type of fish, they are separate concepts within the Edible
  Fish class. Merging them would lead to a loss of specificity and clarity in the
  classification. It is essential to maintain distinct instances for each fish species
  to provide accurate information about their nutritional value, cooking methods,
  and other relevant characteristics.
