  While both guava paste and guava jam are made from guavas, they have different textures
  and consistencies, with guava paste being thicker and more spreadable, while guava
  jam is thinner and more pourable. Additionally, their flavor profiles may differ
  slightly due to differences in sugar content and cooking methods. Therefore, it''s
  appropriate to keep them separate as distinct instances in the Edible Fruit class.'
