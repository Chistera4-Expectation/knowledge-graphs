  While kiwi seeds and poppy seeds are both edible seeds, they have different nutritional
  profiles, uses, and cultural significance. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. It is important to maintain
  their distinct identities within the context of an "Edible Seeds" class or any similar
  categorization system.'
