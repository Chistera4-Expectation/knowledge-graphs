  Although both "cooked rice" and "wild rice" are types of rice, they differ significantly
  in terms of their nutritional content, culinary uses, and growth patterns. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Here is some more information about each:


  * Cooked rice refers to any type of rice that has been boiled and drained until
  soft and fluffy. It can come from various varieties such as white rice, brown rice,
  jasmine rice, basmati rice, etc. The nutritional value depends on the specific variety
  and cooking method used. However, cooked rice generally provides carbohydrates,
  fiber (in whole grain versions), and some protein but low amounts of fat and vitamins.

  * Wild rice, on the other hand, is not technically a type of rice at all. Instead,
  wild rice is an aquatic grass native to North America, although now also commercially
  cultivated elsewhere. Compared to cooked rice, wild rice contains fewer calories
  per serving and higher levels of protein, fiber, B-vitamins, zinc, folate, magnesium,
  phosphorus, manganese, and antioxidants like ferulic acid. Its texture and flavor
  profile also tend to be nuttier and earthier than regular rice.


  Given these differences, keeping separate entries for "cooked rice" and "wild rice"
  makes sense for accurate categorization based on nutrition, taste, and origin.'
