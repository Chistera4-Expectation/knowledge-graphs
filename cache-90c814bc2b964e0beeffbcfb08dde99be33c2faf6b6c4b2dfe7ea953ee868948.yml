text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are juice types, they have
  different ingredients and nutritional profiles. Vegetable juice typically consists
  of various vegetables, providing a different nutrient composition compared to watermelon
  juice, which is made primarily from watermelon. Merging them as duplicates would
  not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
