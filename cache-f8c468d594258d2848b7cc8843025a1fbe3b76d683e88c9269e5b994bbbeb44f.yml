text: ' No. While "Name of the cheese" could be seen as a more general category that
  includes "Swiss cheese," they are not exact duplicates in terms of their meaning
  and usage. "Name of the cheese" is a broader term that refers to any name given
  to a particular type of cheese, while "Swiss cheese" specifically refers to a specific
  variety of cheese originating from Switzerland. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
