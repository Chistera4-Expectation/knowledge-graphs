text: ' No. While black rice is a type of rice, it has different nutritional content
  and properties compared to other types of rice, such as white or brown rice. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates in the context
  of a dietary classification system. It''s important to maintain the distinction
  between different varieties of rice due to their unique nutritional profiles and
  potential health benefits.'
