text: ' No. While sushi rice is a type of rice that has been prepared in a specific
  way for use in sushi, it is not appropriate to merge the concepts of "rice" and
  "sushi rice" as they refer to different levels of abstraction within the domain
  of food and cooking. Merging them would result in a loss of important distinctions
  between these two related but distinct concepts.'
