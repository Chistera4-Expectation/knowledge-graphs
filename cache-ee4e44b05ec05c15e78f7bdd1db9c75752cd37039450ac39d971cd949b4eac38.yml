text: No, Chicken Broth and Chicken Gizzards should not be merged together as they
  are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from poultry,
  they are different food items with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking.
  Chicken Broth is a liquid made from boiling chicken bones and meat, while Chicken
  Gizzards are a specific part of the chicken's digestive system that is often consumed
  as a food item.
