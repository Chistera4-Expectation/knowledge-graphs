  While Caesar dressing and French dressing can be similar in terms of their purpose
  (to add flavor to salads), they have distinct ingredients and preparation methods
  that make them unique. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. It is important to maintain these distinctions for those
  who need to avoid certain ingredients due to allergies or dietary restrictions.'
