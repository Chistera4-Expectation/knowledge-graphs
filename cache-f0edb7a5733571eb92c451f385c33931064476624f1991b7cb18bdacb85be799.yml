text: No, Distilled Water and Mineral Water should not be merged together as they
  have different properties and purposes. Distilled Water is water that has been boiled
  into vapor and condensed back into liquid in a separate container, leaving most
  impurities behind. Mineral Water, on the other hand, is water from a mineral spring
  that contains various minerals, such as salts and sulfur compounds, and may have
  therapeutic benefits. These two types of water are distinct and should not be considered
  semantic or ontologic duplicates.
