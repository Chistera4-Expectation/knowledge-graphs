text: ' No. Buckwheat honey and heather honey are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While they are both types of honey, they come
  from different floral sources and have distinct flavor profiles, nutritional content,
  and uses. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate categories for these two
  varieties of honey.'
