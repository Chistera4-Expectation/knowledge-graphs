text: ' The most appropriate classification for "Acidity Regulators" would be under
  ''Food Seasoning''. Acid regulators are used to balance the acidity or alkalinity
  of food, which is a key aspect of seasoning. They can also function as flavor enhancers
  and taste modifiers in various dishes, making them fall within the category of seasonings.
  While they may sometimes be found in sauces or dressings, their primary purpose
  is not limited to these specific types of condiments.'
