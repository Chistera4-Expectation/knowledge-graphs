text: ' No. While both Asian Sesame Dressing and French Dressing are types of salad
  dressings, they have distinct differences in ingredients and flavors. Asian Sesame
  Dressing typically includes sesame seeds, rice vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, garlic,
  and sugar, while French Dressing is made with oil, vinegar, mustard, shallots, and
  herbs such as tarragon and chives. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
