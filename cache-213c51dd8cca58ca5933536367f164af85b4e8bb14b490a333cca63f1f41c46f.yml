text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are derived from ostriches, they refer to different forms of the food product -
  one is the meat itself, while the other is a specific preparation of the meat (patties).
  They have different nutritional values and cooking properties, and thus are not
  considered duplicates in the context of a dietician's classification system.
