text: ' It depends on the specific definitions and formulations of "Chipotle Mayo"
  and "Spicy Mayo." If they are identical or very similar in ingredients and flavor
  profile, then merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates may be appropriate.
  However, if there are differences between the two (e.g., chipotle mayo might contain
  smoked chipotle peppers while spicy mayo contains other types of hot peppers), it
  would be more accurate to keep them separate. A thorough analysis of their respective
  recipes and properties is necessary before making a decision.'
