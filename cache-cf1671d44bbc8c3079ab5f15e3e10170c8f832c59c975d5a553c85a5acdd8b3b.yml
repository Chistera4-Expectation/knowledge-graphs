text: No, they should not be merged as they are different in composition and presentation.
  Assorted fruit slices typically refer to a selection of cut fruit, while fruit salad
  is a mixture of various fruits, often in a dressing or with added ingredients like
  yogurt or whipped cream. Although both contain fruits, they are distinct dishes
  with different preparation methods and presentations.
