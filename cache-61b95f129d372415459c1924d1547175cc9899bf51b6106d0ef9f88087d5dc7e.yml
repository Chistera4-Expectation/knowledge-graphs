text: As a dietician, I can provide my professional opinion on the matter. From a
  nutritional standpoint, Alfredo sauce and Tartar sauce have distinct ingredients
  and nutritional profiles, so they should not be considered semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. Therefore, the answer is no. They should not be merged together.
