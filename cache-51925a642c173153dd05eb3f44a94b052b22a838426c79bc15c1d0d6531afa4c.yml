text: No, "Forbidden Rice" and "Sticky Rice" should not be merged as they are two
  distinct types of rice with different characteristics and uses. Forbidden Rice,
  also known as Black Rice, has a nutty flavor and a high nutritional value, while
  Sticky Rice is a type of glutinous rice with a high starch content, making it sticky
  when cooked. They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates, as they have different
  properties and uses.
