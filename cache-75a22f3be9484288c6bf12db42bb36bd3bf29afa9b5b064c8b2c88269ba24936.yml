  Green onions and scallions are actually the same vegetable, also known by other
  names such as spring onions or salad onions. They refer to young onion plants that
  are harvested before they fully mature, resulting in thin stalks with hollow green
  leaves and small white bulbs at the base. Therefore, it is appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates, since they describe the same edible
  plant.'
