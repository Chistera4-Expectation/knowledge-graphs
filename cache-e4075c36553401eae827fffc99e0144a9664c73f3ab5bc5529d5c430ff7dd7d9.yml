  The instances ''if so what kind'' and ''if so what type'' can be considered semantic
  and ontological duplicates because they both seek to gather information about the
  specific characteristics of an object or concept (in this case, coffee) by asking
  for its category or classification. Merging them would not significantly impact
  the overall meaning or understanding, as their purpose is essentially the same.
  A more general instance such as ''what kind/type of coffee'' could also be used
  instead.'
