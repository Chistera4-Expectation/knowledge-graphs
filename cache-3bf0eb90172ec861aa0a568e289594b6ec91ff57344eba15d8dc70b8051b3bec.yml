text: No, 'Duck Nuggets' and 'Pheasant Nuggets' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are poultry-derived nuggets, they come from
  different types of birds and may have different nutritional profiles or flavor characteristics.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent the distinct nature of each
  food item.
