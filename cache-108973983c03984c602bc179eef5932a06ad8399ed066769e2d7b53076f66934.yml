text: ' No. Fenugreek seeds and watermelon seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of edible seeds. They have different nutritional profiles,
  tastes, textures, and uses in cooking, making them distinct from one another. Therefore,
  they should remain separate entries within the context of an "Edible Seeds" class
  or category.'
