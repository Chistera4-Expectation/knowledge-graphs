text: ' No, these instances should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both instances deal with grass-fed beef, they serve different purposes in
  an ontology or knowledge graph. The first instance provides a detailed description
  of what grass-fed beef is, while the second instance simply names the concept without
  further explanation. Merging them could lead to redundancy and confusion in the
  structure of the information.'
