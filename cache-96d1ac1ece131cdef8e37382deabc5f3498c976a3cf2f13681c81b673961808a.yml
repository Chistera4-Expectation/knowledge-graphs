text: ' No. Swiss cheese is a specific type of cheese that belongs to the broader
  category of cheese. While they are related concepts, they refer to different things
  and therefore should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. It would
  be more appropriate to have them as separate instances with a relationship between
  them indicating that Swiss cheese is a type of cheese.'
