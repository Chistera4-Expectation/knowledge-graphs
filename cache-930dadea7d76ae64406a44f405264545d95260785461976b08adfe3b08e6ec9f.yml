text: No, 'Pheasant Eggs' and 'Pheasant Patties' should not be merged together as
  they are different poultry-derived food items. Pheasant Eggs are the eggs laid by
  pheasants, while Pheasant Patties are typically ground pheasant meat formed into
  a patty shape, often used for making burgers or similar dishes.
