text: No, Alfalfa Honey and Eucalyptus Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of honey, they are derived from
  different plant sources (alfalfa and eucalyptus) and have distinct flavors and properties.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between these types
  of honey.
