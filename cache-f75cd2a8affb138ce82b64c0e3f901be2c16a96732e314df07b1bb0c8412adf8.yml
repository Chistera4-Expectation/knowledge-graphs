text: ' No. Caesar Dressing and Lemon Juice Dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. While both may be used as dressings, they have distinct ingredients
  and flavors. Caesar Dressing typically contains anchovies, garlic, Worcestershire
  sauce, and Parmesan cheese, among other ingredients, giving it a unique taste. Lemon
  Juice Dressing, on the other hand, is primarily made with lemon juice, oil, salt,
  pepper, and sugar (or honey), resulting in a tangy and citrusy flavor. Therefore,
  they remain separate entities.'
