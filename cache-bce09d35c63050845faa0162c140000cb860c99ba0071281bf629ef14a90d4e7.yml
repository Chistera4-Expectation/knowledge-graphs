text: No, they should not be merged together. Coconut water and distilled water are
  different types of water with distinct properties and uses. Coconut water is a natural
  beverage obtained from young, green coconuts, while distilled water is a purified
  water obtained through a distillation process. They have different nutritional values
  and are used for different purposes.
