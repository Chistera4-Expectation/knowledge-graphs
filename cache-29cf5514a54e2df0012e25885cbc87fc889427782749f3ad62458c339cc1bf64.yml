text: No, they should not be merged. Although both 'Macadamia Milk' and 'Milk' are
  related, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Milk' is a more general
  term, while 'Macadamia Milk' is a specific type of milk made from macadamia nuts.
  They belong to the same class but represent different entities within that class.
