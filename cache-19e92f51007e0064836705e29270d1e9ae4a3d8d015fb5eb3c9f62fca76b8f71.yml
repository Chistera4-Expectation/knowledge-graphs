text: ' No. While both Blue Cheese Dressing and French Dressing are types of salad
  dressings, they have distinct differences in terms of their ingredients and flavors.
  Blue Cheese Dressing is made with blue cheese, mayonnaise, buttermilk, vinegar,
  and spices, while French Dressing typically consists of oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic,
  shallots, herbs, and sometimes sugar. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.'
