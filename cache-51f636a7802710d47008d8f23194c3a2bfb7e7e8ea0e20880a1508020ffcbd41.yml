text: No, while both "Chicken Gravy" and "Quail Gravy" are derived from poultry, they
  are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct entities based on the
  type of poultry used as the primary ingredient (chicken vs. quail) and would be
  classified separately in a poultry-derived food class.
