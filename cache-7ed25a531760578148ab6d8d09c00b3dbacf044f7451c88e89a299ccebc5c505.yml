text: No, Grapeseed Oil and Palm Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  properties, uses, and nutritional compositions. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the unique characteristics of each oil.
