  While both dishes contain chicken, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they have different ingredients and preparation methods. A Chicken Caesar
  Salad is typically made with romaine lettuce, croutons, parmesan cheese, and a dressing
  made from lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, egg, Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies;
  whereas, Chicken Parmesan consists of breaded chicken topped with tomato sauce and
  melted mozzarella or parmesan cheese. Therefore, these two dishes offer distinct
  flavors and textures despite having chicken as a common ingredient.'
