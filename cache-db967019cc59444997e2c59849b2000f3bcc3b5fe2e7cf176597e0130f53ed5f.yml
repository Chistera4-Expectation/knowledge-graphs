  Chicken nuggets and low-sodium chicken broth are not semantic nor ontological duplicates,
  despite both being poultry-derived foods. They serve different purposes nutritionally,
  have distinct ingredients, preparation methods, and uses in cooking and meals. Merging
  them would lead to incorrect assumptions about their properties and roles in a balanced
  diet.'
