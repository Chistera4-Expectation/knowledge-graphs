text: As a dietician, I would recommend keeping both 'Carrot Ginger' and 'Sesame Ginger'
  as separate instances. Although they share the common ingredient of ginger, they
  are distinct dressings with unique flavor profiles due to the presence of carrot
  and sesame, respectively. Keeping them separate allows for better organization and
  tracking of recipes and ingredients.
