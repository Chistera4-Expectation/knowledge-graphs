text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. While both Red chili peppers and chili
  flakes are spices and have similar flavors, they are different in terms of their
  form and how they are used in cooking. Red chili peppers are typically whole or
  sliced, while chili flakes are dried and ground into small pieces. They may have
  some overlap in their usage, but they are not exactly the same thing and should
  not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
