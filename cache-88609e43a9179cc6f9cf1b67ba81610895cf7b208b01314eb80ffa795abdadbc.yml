text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Hydrogen
  water refers to water that has been infused with hydrogen gas, while water for egg
  wash is water used in cooking to brush over the surface of dough or food items to
  help achieve a glossy, golden-brown finish. Although both are forms of water, their
  uses and properties are different, making them distinct instances.
