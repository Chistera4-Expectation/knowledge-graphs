text: ' No. While both Creamy Italian Dressing and Thousand Island Dressing contain
  cream and share some similarities in taste and texture, they have distinct ingredients
  and flavor profiles. Creamy Italian Dressing typically includes olive oil, vinegar,
  garlic, Parmesan cheese, and herbs like basil and oregano. Thousand Island Dressing,
  on the other hand, consists of mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, onions, relish, and
  sometimes hard-boiled eggs. Therefore, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.'
