text: No, they should not be merged together. While both instances refer to adding
  vegetables to the dish, '(Optional) Peas' specifies a specific vegetable, while
  'other vegetables for variation' allows for a variety of vegetables to be added.
  Merging them would limit the flexibility and options for the dish.
