  While both "Comb Honey" and "Linden Honey" are types of honey, they refer to different
  forms and sources of honey. Comb Honey is pure, raw honey that still contains beeswax
  comb, while Linden Honey is a specific variety of honey made from the nectar of
  linden (or basswood) trees. Therefore, these two terms cannot be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
