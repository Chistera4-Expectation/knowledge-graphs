  While both bulking agents and optional dipping sauces can be used to add volume
  or flavor to food, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. Bulking agents
  refer to substances added to foods primarily for their ability to increase the bulk
  or volume of the food without significantly changing its taste or texture. Examples
  include cellulose, maltodextrin, and guar gum. On the other hand, an optional dipping
  sauce is a condiment served alongside a dish that diners may choose to use for additional
  flavor; it does not necessarily have any effect on the bulk or volume of the food
  itself. Therefore, these two concepts serve different purposes and should not be
  merged.'
