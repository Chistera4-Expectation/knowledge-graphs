text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both Guinea Fowl Patties and
  Ostrich Patties are poultry-derived food items, they are different types of poultry
  with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Therefore, they should be
  treated as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
