  While both pizza dough and sourdough are types of bread, they have distinct ingredients,
  preparation methods, and uses. Pizza dough typically contains yeast, flour, water,
  sugar, salt, and sometimes oil, while sourdough is made with a starter containing
  wild bacteria and yeasts that ferment the dough. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two classes as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
