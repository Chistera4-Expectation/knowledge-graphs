text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Mealworm
  powder and silkworm pupae are different types of insect-derived food, each with
  distinct properties, nutritional content, and culinary uses. They are not semantically
  or ontologically equivalent, and they should be treated as separate instances in
  a classification system.
