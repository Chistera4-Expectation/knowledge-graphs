text: No, the instances 'Cream cheese' and 'Feta cheese' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of cheese, they have distinct
  characteristics, production processes, and uses in recipes. They should be kept
  as separate instances in the Cheese class.
