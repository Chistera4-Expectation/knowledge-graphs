text: As a dietician, my answer is no. While cumin seeds and ground cumin both come
  from the same plant and have similar flavors, they are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. They are different forms of the same spice, and each has its own unique
  properties, such as texture and flavor intensity. They are used differently in recipes
  and can have different effects on the final dish. Merging them together would not
  accurately represent the culinary world.
