text: ' The most adequate class for "Herbs" among the given options would be "Edible
  Herbs". This is because herbs are plant-based foods that are typically used for
  their flavor, aroma, or medicinal properties. They can be consumed fresh, dried,
  or in extracted forms and are often added to dishes as seasonings rather than being
  the main component of the food itself (like bread, cereals, fruits, mushrooms, seaweed,
  seeds, vegetables, oils, pastas, rice).'
