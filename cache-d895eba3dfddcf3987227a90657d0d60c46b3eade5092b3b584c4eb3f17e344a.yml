text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both are derived from tomatoes, they have different properties, uses, and nutritional
  values. Canned crushed tomatoes are typically chunkier and retain more of the texture
  of fresh tomatoes, while tomato paste is a concentrated, thicker form of tomatoes
  with a more intense flavor. These differences make them distinct entities in a dietician's
  perspective.
