text: No, they should not be merged together. Coconut oil is a specific type of edible
  oil derived from coconuts, while cooking oil is a more general term that encompasses
  various types of edible oils used for cooking, which may include coconut oil, but
  also olive oil, vegetable oil, and others. They have different properties, uses,
  and nutritional profiles, so they should be considered as distinct instances.
