text: As a dietician, I would say no, they should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of bread, they have different
  ingredients and preparation methods. Flaxseed bread contains flaxseeds, which provide
  additional nutritional benefits, while grilled bread is a method of preparation,
  not a specific type of bread.
