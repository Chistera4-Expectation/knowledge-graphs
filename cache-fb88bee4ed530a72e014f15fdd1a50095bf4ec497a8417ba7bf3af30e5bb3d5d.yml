  The two instances, "Sichuan peppercorns" and "pepper to taste," are not exact duplicates.
  While they both refer to the same spice, they have different meanings in the context
  of the recipe. "Sichuan peppercorns" refers specifically to the dried fruit of the
  Sichuan pepper plant, which has a unique flavor and texture, while "pepper to taste"
  is a more general term that can refer to any type of pepper, including freshly ground
  black pepper, white pepper, green pepper, etc.


  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
