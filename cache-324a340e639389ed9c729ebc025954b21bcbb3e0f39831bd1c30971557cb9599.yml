text: ' Based on the options you have provided, I would recommend "Edible Fish" as
  the most adequate food class for someone who follows a ''White'' or primarily white-colored
  diet. This is because many types of fish are white in color and can be incorporated
  into various dishes while providing beneficial nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids,
  protein, vitamins, and minerals. However, it''s important to note that following
  a monochromatic diet may not provide all the necessary nutrients required by the
  human body. A balanced and diverse diet consisting of different colored foods from
  each food group is recommended for optimal health.'
