text: As a dietician, my answer is no. While both "Chicken Gizzards" and "Guinea Fowl
  Gizzards" are poultry-derived foods, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  They come from different bird species, and the nutritional content, taste, and texture
  of the gizzards may vary between the two. Therefore, they should be treated as distinct
  instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
