text: ' No. Jasmine rice and short-grain rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. While both jasmine rice and short-grain
  rice are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics and uses.


  Jasmine rice is a long-grain variety that is known for its fragrance and slightly
  sticky texture when cooked. It is commonly used in Thai and other Southeast Asian
  cuisines.


  Short-grain rice, on the other hand, has a shorter and rounder grain than jasmine
  rice. When cooked, it becomes very soft and sticky, making it ideal for dishes like
  sushi, risotto, and paella.


  Therefore, while jasmine rice and short-grain rice may fall under the broader category
  of "rice," they cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they possess unique properties and serve different culinary purposes.'
