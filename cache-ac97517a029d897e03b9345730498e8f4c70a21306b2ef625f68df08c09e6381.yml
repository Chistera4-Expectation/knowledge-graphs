text: ' No. Grated Parmesan cheese and Pecorino Romano cheese are not semantic and
  ontological duplicates, even though they may have some similar uses and properties.
  They come from different animals (cow vs sheep), have slightly different flavors
  and textures, and originate from distinct geographical locations (Italy). Therefore,
  it is important to maintain them as separate instances with their unique characteristics.'
