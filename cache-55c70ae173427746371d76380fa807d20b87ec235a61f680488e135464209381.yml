  While chili powder and chili flakes are both made from dried chilies, they have
  different textures, flavors, and uses in cooking. Chili powder is ground into a
  fine consistency and often contains other spices such as cumin, garlic, and oregano,
  while chili flakes consist of small pieces of dried chilies with varying levels
  of heat. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
