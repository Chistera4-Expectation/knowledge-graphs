text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Vegetable Broth" and "Vegetables"
  are related in the context of edible vegetables, they are distinct entities with
  different properties and usage. "Vegetable Broth" refers to a liquid made by boiling
  vegetables, while "Vegetables" refers to a broad category of plants that are consumed
  as food. Merging them would lead to confusion and loss of important distinctions.
