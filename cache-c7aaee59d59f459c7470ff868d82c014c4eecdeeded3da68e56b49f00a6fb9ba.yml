text: No, 'Alkaline Water' and 'Hard Water' should not be merged together as they
  have distinct properties and characteristics. Alkaline water is characterized by
  its higher pH level, while hard water is characterized by its high mineral content,
  particularly calcium and magnesium. Although both types of water can be considered
  as subcategories of drinking water, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates
  as they possess different properties and effects.
