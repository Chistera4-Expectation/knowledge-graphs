text: No, the instances "Beech Mushroom" and "Enoki Mushroom" should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible mushrooms,
  they are different species with distinct characteristics and culinary uses. Beech
  mushrooms (Hypsizygus tessulatus) are commonly found in the wild and have a nutty
  flavor, while enoki mushrooms (Flammulina velutipes) are cultivated and have a long,
  slender shape with a mild, sweet flavor. These differences warrant separate classifications
  in the edible mushroom class.
