text: ' No. While "Mascarpone cheese" and "serving size of Mascarpone cheese" are
  related concepts, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer
  to different aspects of the same food item. Merging them would result in loss of
  important information about serving sizes, which is crucial for nutritional analysis
  and meal planning.'
