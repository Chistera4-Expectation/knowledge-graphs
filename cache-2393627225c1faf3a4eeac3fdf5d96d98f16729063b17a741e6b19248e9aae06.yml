text: No, Alkaline Water and Artisanal Water are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct characteristics that
  set them apart. Alkaline Water has a higher pH level than regular drinking water,
  while Artisanal Water is typically sourced from natural springs and may have unique
  mineral content. Therefore, they should not be merged as duplicates.
