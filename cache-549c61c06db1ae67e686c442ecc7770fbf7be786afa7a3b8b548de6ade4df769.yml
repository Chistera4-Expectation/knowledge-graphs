text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Fish stock' and 'Fish' are
  related to edible fish, they refer to different things. 'Fish stock' refers to a
  type of broth made from fish bones and other ingredients, while 'Fish' refers to
  the actual fish meat. They have distinct properties and uses in a dietary context.
