text: No, Parboiled Rice and Wild Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are distinct types of rice with different properties, preparation
  methods, and nutritional profiles. Parboiled Rice is a type of rice that has been
  partially boiled in the husk, while Wild Rice is a separate species of grass that
  is related to, but distinct from, rice. Both have unique characteristics and uses
  in various cuisines.
