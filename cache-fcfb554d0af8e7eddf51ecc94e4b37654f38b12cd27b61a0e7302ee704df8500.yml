text: No, they should not be merged as they have different properties and uses. Apricot
  kernel oil is rich in vitamin E and unsaturated fatty acids, and is often used in
  skincare products and as a carrier oil in aromatherapy. Peanut oil, on the other
  hand, is a common cooking oil and contains high levels of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated
  fats. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct characteristics
  and applications.
