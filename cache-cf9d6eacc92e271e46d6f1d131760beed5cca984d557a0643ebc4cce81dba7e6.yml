text: No, Sichuan peppercorns and White pepper should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are spices, they have different properties,
  flavors, and uses in cooking. Sichuan peppercorns are known for their unique numbing
  sensation and floral aroma, while White pepper is milder and has a more straightforward,
  spicy flavor.
