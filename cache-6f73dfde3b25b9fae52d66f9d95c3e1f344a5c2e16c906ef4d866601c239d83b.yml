  The two instances, "Browned butter" and "Chili butter," are not identical in their
  preparation methods, taste, or culinary uses, making them distinct concepts. Browned
  butter is made by cooking butter to develop a nutty flavor and caramel color, while
  chili butter is made by blending butter with chili peppers for a spicy kick. They
  have different textures and tastes, so they shouldn''t be considered duplicates.'
