  The reason is that "Arborio rice" refers to a specific type of rice, which has a
  unique texture and properties due to its high starch content, whereas "cooked rice"
  refers to any type of rice that has been cooked. These are two distinct concepts,
  and therefore they should not be merged as duplicates.'
