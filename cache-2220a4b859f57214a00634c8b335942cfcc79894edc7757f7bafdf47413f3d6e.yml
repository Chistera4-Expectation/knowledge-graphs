text: No, 'Forbidden Rice' and 'Steamed White Rice' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have distinct
  characteristics, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. 'Forbidden Rice,' also
  known as black rice, is rich in antioxidants and fiber, while 'Steamed White Rice'
  is more commonly used and has a milder flavor and texture.
