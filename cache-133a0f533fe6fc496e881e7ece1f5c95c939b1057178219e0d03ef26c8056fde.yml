text: No, "Sliced onions" and "Tomato slices" should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they are both vegetable slices, they are distinct
  types of vegetables with different nutritional profiles and uses in recipes. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the variety of vegetables in the Edible Vegetable
  class.
