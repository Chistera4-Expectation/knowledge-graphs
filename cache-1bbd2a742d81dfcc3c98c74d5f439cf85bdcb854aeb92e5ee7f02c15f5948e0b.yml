  While both grapeseed oil and rice bran oil are edible vegetable oils, they have
  different nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses in cooking. Grapeseed oil is higher
  in polyunsaturated fats and has a more neutral flavor, while rice bran oil is higher
  in monounsaturated fats and has a nuttier, slightly sweet flavor. Additionally,
  they come from different sources (grapes vs. rice) and may have different production
  processes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.'
