text: No, while both 'Ostrich Meat' and 'Ostrich Sausage' are derived from the same
  animal, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. 'Ostrich Meat' refers to
  the raw meat itself, while 'Ostrich Sausage' is a processed product made from ostrich
  meat combined with other ingredients. They have different properties, preparations,
  and uses, so they should be treated as separate instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
