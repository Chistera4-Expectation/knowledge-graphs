text: No, "Chicken Sausage" and "Chicken Tenders" should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both are derived from chicken, they are
  distinct food items with different ingredients, textures, and culinary uses. "Chicken
  Sausage" is a processed and seasoned meat product typically made from ground chicken,
  while "Chicken Tenders" are typically a cut of boneless, skinless chicken breast
  meat that is shaped like a tenderloin.
