text: No, they should not be merged together. Chinese Broccoli (Gai Lan) and Steamed
  Broccoli are two different types of vegetables. Chinese Broccoli is a specific variety
  of Brassica oleracea, while Steamed Broccoli refers to the cooking method applied
  to the common broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica). Although they both belong
  to the same broader category of edible vegetables, they are distinct entities with
  unique characteristics and nutritional profiles.
