text: No, Manuka Honey and Orange Blossom Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and origins. Manuka Honey is known for its unique antibacterial
  properties and is primarily sourced from New Zealand, while Orange Blossom Honey
  has a citrusy flavor and is produced from the nectar of orange blossoms.
