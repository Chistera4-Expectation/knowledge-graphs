text: No, Sunflower Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both vegetable oils, they have distinct
  properties and uses. Sunflower Oil is extracted from sunflower seeds, while Wheat
  Germ Oil is extracted from the germ of wheat kernels. They also have different fatty
  acid compositions and nutritional profiles, which makes them unique and separate
  in terms of dietary and culinary applications.
