text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both 'Chicken Thighs' and 'Pheasant Thighs' are poultry-derived food items,
  they are distinct types of meat with different nutritional profiles, flavors, and
  uses in cooking. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
