text: No, "Chicken Soup" and "Chicken Tenders" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from chicken, they are different
  food items with distinct preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Chicken Soup
  is a liquid-based dish typically containing broth, vegetables, and other ingredients,
  while Chicken Tenders are a specific cut of meat that is often breaded and fried.
