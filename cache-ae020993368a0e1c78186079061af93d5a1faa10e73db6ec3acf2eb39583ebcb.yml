  The two instances, "Boneless, skinless chicken breast" and "Chicken broth," are
  not identical in terms of their composition, nutritional content, or culinary usage.
  Boneless, skinless chicken breast is a lean protein made from the pectoral muscles
  of a chicken, while chicken broth is a savory liquid made by simmering chicken bones,
  meat, and vegetables. Although both can contribute to a healthy diet, they have
  different purposes and uses in cooking. Therefore, it''s appropriate to keep them
  separate rather than merging them as duplicates.'
