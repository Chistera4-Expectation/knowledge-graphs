text: No, Mineral Water and Purified Water should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct differences
  in their composition and production process. Mineral Water contains naturally occurring
  minerals and can be sourced from springs or boreholes, while Purified Water undergoes
  a purification process to remove impurities and is typically sourced from tap water
  or surface water. These differences warrant separate categorization within the Drinking
  Water class.
