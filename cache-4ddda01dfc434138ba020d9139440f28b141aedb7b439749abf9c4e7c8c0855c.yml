  While both fresh raw fish and sashimi-grade fish are types of raw fish, they do
  not have the same meaning and cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Fresh raw fish refers to any type of fish that has been recently caught and prepared
  for consumption without being cooked. Sashimi-grade fish, on the other hand, is
  a specific quality of raw fish that meets strict standards for freshness, texture,
  color, and flavor, making it suitable for use in sashimi, a traditional Japanese
  dish made from thinly sliced raw fish. Therefore, while there may be some overlap
  between these two concepts, they are not identical and should not be merged together.'
