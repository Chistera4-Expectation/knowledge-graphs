text: ' No. Five-spice powder and rice vinegar are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They serve different purposes in cooking and have distinct flavors and uses. Five-spice
  powder is a blend of five spices (usually including star anise, cloves, cinnamon,
  Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds) used to add flavor and aroma to dishes, while
  rice vinegar is a type of vinegar made from fermented rice and used for its tart,
  acidic taste in seasoning and marinades.'
