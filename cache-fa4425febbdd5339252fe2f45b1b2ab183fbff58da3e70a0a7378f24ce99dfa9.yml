text: ' No. While bell peppers and fresh chili peppers are both types of vegetables
  and can belong to the same taxonomic category within an ontology, they have distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and uses that make them unique and non-duplicate entities
  in terms of semantics. Merging these two instances would result in loss of specificity
  and could lead to incorrect nutritional information or recommendations when considering
  their differences.'
