text: No, Ceylon Tea and Oolong Tea are distinct types of tea and should not be merged
  as duplicates. They have different origins, processing methods, and flavor profiles.
  Ceylon Tea comes from Sri Lanka and is a black tea, while Oolong Tea is a semi-oxidized
  tea originating from China and Taiwan. Both are unique and should be treated as
  separate entities in a class hierarchy.
