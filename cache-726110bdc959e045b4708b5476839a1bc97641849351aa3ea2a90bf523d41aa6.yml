text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both are derived from poultry, ostrich meat and turkey meatballs are different in
  terms of their composition, preparation, and nutritional properties. Ostrich meat
  is a lean red meat, while turkey meatballs are a processed, ground meat product
  made from turkey, which could have additional ingredients like breadcrumbs or seasonings.
