text: ' No. The instances "type of water being consumed" and "ice water" are not semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While ice water is one specific type of drinking water,
  it still has distinct properties (such as temperature) that differentiate it from
  other types of drinking water. Therefore, they should remain separate instances.'
