text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and
  cultural origins. Piri Piri sauce is a spicy sauce from Portugal and Africa, while
  Teriyaki sauce is a sweet and savory sauce from Japan. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the differences between the two sauces.
