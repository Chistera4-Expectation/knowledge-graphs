text: No, these instances should not be merged together as they represent different
  types of vegetables. "Other leafy greens" specifically refers to leafy vegetables,
  while "other vegetables for variation" is a broader category that may include other
  types of vegetables beyond leafy greens, offering more variety in a diet.
