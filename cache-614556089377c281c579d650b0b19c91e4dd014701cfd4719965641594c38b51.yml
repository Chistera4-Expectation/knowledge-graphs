text: No, Turkey Gizzards and Turkey Soup should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from turkey, they are different
  types of food with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary applications. Turkey
  Gizzards are a specific part of the turkey, while Turkey Soup is a dish that may
  or may not include gizzards as an ingredient. Merging them as duplicates would not
  accurately reflect their differences and would lead to confusion in a knowledge
  base.
