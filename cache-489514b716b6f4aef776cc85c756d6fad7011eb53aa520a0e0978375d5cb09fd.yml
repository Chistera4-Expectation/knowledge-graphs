  While mustard seeds and sesame seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles, flavors, textures, culinary uses, and cultural significance.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates
  from a dietary perspective. They each deserve their own unique entries within an
  "Edible Seeds" classification system due to these differences.'
