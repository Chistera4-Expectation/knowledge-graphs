text: No, "Icelandic Yogurt" and "Vegan Yogurt" should not be merged together as they
  are distinct types of yogurt based on their ingredients and origins. Icelandic Yogurt,
  also known as Skyr, is a dairy product made from skim milk, while Vegan Yogurt is
  made from plant-based alternatives like soy, almond, or coconut milk. They have
  different nutritional profiles and target different dietary preferences or requirements.
