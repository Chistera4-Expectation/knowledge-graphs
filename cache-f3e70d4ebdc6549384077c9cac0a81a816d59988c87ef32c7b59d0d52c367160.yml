text: No, the instances 'Oyster' and 'Oysters' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they refer to the same species, 'Oyster' refers
  to a single mollusc, while 'Oysters' refers to a group or multiple oysters. They
  have different meanings and should be kept separate in a classification system.
