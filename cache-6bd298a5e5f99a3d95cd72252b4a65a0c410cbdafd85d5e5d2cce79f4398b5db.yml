text: No, Redfish and Sushi-grade fish should not be merged together as they are different
  types of fish with distinct characteristics and properties. Redfish is a specific
  type of fish, while Sushi-grade fish refers to a quality standard for various types
  of fish that can be safely consumed raw in dishes like sushi.
