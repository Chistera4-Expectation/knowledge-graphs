text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Pheasant Nuggets" and "Pheasant
  Sausage" are derived from poultry, they are different food products with distinct
  preparation methods, textures, and uses. Merging them together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates would not accurately represent the differences between the two.
