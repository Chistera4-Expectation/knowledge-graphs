  While both chicken pot pie and chicken wings are types of poultry-derived food,
  they have distinct ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. Chicken
  pot pie typically consists of diced cooked chicken, mixed vegetables (such as peas,
  carrots, and corn), and a thick sauce enclosed in pastry crust, while chicken wings
  consist of the wing portion of the bird that is often deep-fried or baked with various
  seasonings. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.'
