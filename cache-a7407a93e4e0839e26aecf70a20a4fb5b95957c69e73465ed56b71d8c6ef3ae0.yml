text: ' No. Idli rice, which is also known as parboiled rice or idli rawa, and wild
  rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates. They belong to different categories
  of rice with distinct characteristics and uses.


  Idli rice (parboiled rice) undergoes a steaming process before being dried and milled,
  resulting in shorter grains that cook faster and retain more nutrients compared
  to regular white rice. It is primarily used for making soft and fluffy South Indian
  dishes like idlis and dosas.


  On the other hand, Wild rice refers to four species of grass native to North America
  and China, whose edible grain-like seeds have been traditionally harvested by indigenous
  peoples. These grains typically have long, dark brown or black strands with a chewy
  texture and rich, earthy flavor. Compared to most types of cultivated rice, wild
  rice has higher protein content and contains various essential minerals and antioxidants.


  Given their differences in origin, processing methods, appearance, taste, nutrition
  profile, and traditional culinary applications, it would not be appropriate to merge
  Idli rice and Wild rice into a single concept from both semantic and ontological
  perspectives.'
