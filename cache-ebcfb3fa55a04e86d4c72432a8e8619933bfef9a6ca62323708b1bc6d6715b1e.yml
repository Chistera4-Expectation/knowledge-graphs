  While both Chicken Parmesan and Grilled Chicken are poultry-derived foods, they
  have different preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Therefore, they cannot
  be considered semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Chicken Parmesan is typically prepared by breading and frying chicken cutlets before
  topping them with tomato sauce and melted cheese, resulting in higher calories,
  fat, and sodium compared to grilled chicken. On the other hand, Grilled Chicken
  involves cooking boneless, skinless chicken breasts on a grill or griddle, which
  results in lower calorie, lean protein option. Merging these two distinct dishes
  would not accurately represent their unique characteristics and uses.'
