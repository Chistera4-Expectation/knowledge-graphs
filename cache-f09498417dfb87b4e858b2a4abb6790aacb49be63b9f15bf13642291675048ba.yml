text: As a dietician, I would recommend not merging 'Date syrup' and 'Maple syrup'
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are sweeteners and have similar
  uses, they have different nutritional profiles, tastes, and origins. Date syrup
  is made from dates, while maple syrup is made from the sap of maple trees. They
  also have varying levels of nutrients, such as minerals and antioxidants. Therefore,
  it's essential to differentiate them in a Sweetener class.
