text: ' No. Feta cheese and grated Parmesan cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they are both types of cheese. They have different tastes,
  textures, nutritional profiles, production methods, uses in cooking, and cultural
  significance. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between them when providing
  nutrition advice or discussing food with clients.'
