  While both "chicken broth" and "fried chicken" are poultry-derived foods, they have
  different nutritional profiles and cooking methods, making them distinct food items
  that cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates. Chicken broth is typically
  low in calories and fat but high in sodium, while fried chicken has higher amounts
  of calories, fat, and protein due to its breading and deep-frying process. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
