text: ' No. Fried chicken and turkey chili are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They are distinct food items that differ in ingredients, preparation methods, and
  nutritional profiles. While both may contain poultry, they have unique characteristics
  and do not serve as substitutes for one another in a direct sense. Therefore, it
  is appropriate to keep them separate in any classification system.'
