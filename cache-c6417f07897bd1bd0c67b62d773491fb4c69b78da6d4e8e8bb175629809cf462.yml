  While both chicken soup and chicken wings are derived from chickens and contain
  poultry as their primary ingredient, they have different culinary uses and nutritional
  profiles. Chicken soup is typically prepared as a liquid dish with various vegetables
  and seasonings, whereas chicken wings are usually grilled, fried, baked, or broiled
  and served as a standalone protein source. Due to these differences, it would not
  be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
