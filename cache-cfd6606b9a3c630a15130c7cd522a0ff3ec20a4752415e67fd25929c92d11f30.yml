  While both "pork fat" and "roasted pork" are related to pigs and pork products,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to different
  food items with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking.


  * "Pork fat" specifically refers to the fatty tissue found on and within pigs that
  can be rendered down for lard or used in various culinary applications such as sausage
  making or deep frying. It is high in calories and saturated fat.

  * "Roasted pork," on the other hand, typically refers to cooked pork meat (such
  as from a pig roast) which has been seasoned and cooked at high heat, often until
  crispy on the outside. Roasted pork contains protein, vitamins and minerals, but
  also some fat depending on the cut of meat and preparation method.


  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
