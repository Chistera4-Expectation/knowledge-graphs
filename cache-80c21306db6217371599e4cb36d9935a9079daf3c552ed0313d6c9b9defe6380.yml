  While both mechanically separated meat and processed meats are types of poultry-derived
  food products that have undergone processing, they refer to distinct concepts with
  different production methods and characteristics. Mechanically separated meat refers
  specifically to chicken or turkey meat that has been removed from bones using machinery,
  while processed meats include various techniques such as smoking, curing, salting,
  and adding additives for flavor or preservation. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
