text: ' No. Although both pieces of information are related to nutrition and serving
  sizes, they represent distinct concepts and should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Cholesterol per serving pertains specifically to the amount
  of cholesterol found within each individual serving of cheese, while serving size
  refers to the quantity of cheese being considered for consumption. Keeping these
  two attributes separate allows for more precise nutritional tracking and analysis.'
