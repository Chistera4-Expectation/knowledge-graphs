text: No, Enoki mushrooms and Portobello mushrooms should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Although both are types of edible mushrooms,
  they have distinct characteristics, appearances, and culinary uses. Enoki mushrooms
  have thin, long stems with small caps, while Portobello mushrooms have large, dark
  brown caps and dense flesh. They also have different flavors and textures, which
  make them suitable for different dishes.
