text: "No, Clarified Butter and Cultured Butter should not be merged together as they\
  \ have distinct differences in their composition and production methods. \n\nClarified\
  \ Butter is unsalted butter that has been heated to separate the milk solids and\
  \ water, leaving pure butterfat. This process removes impurities and extends the\
  \ shelf life of the butter.\n\nCultured Butter, on the other hand, is made from\
  \ cream that has been fermented with lactic acid bacteria, giving it a tangy flavor.\
  \ The fermentation process also affects the texture of the butter, making it slightly\
  \ more crumbly than regular or clarified butter.\n\nWhile both types of butter share\
  \ some similarities, they have unique characteristics that warrant separate classifications."
