text: No, Nut Milk and Rice Milk should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they both belong to the broader category of plant-based milk
  alternatives, they have different ingredients, nutritional profiles, and uses. Nut
  Milk can be derived from various types of nuts, such as almonds, cashews, or hazelnuts,
  while Rice Milk is made from rice. These differences make them distinct entities
  within the Milk class.
