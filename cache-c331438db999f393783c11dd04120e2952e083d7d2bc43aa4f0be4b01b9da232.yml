text: No. Although they are both sauces, they have different ingredients, flavors,
  and uses, so they should not be merged as duplicates. Hoisin sauce is a sweet and
  salty sauce commonly used in Chinese cuisine, while Hollandaise sauce is a rich,
  buttery sauce typically served with eggs Benedict or asparagus.
