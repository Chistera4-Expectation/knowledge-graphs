  Creamy Garlic Dressing and Wasabi Dressing are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of salad dressings. They have different ingredients (creamy
  garlic dressing typically includes mayonnaise, garlic, and various seasonings while
  wasabi dressing is made with wasabi paste, soy sauce, vinegar, and oil), flavors,
  textures, and uses, which means they cater to different tastes and culinary preferences.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two distinct food items.'
