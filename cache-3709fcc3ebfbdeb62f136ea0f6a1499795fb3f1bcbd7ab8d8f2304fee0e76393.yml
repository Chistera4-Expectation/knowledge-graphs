text: No, the instances 'Pheasant Nuggets' and 'Pheasant Thighs' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different cuts of pheasant
  meat with distinct preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Pheasant Nuggets
  are typically breaded and fried, while Pheasant Thighs are a more recognizable cut
  of meat that can be prepared in various ways.
