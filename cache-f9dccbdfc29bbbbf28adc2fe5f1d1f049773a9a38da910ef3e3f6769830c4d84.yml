text: No, they should not be merged together as they are not semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Organic Butter and Whipped Butter are different types of butter with
  distinct characteristics and production methods. Organic Butter refers to butter
  made from organically raised cows, while Whipped Butter is butter that has been
  whipped to incorporate air, resulting in a lighter and more spreadable texture.
  Both types of butter have their own unique nutritional profiles and uses in cooking
  or baking.
