text: No, Canola Oil and Peanut Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of edible vegetable oils with different
  properties, nutritional values, and uses. Canola Oil is derived from rapeseed plants
  and is known for its neutral taste, high smoke point, and low saturated fat content.
  Peanut Oil, on the other hand, is derived from peanuts and has a nutty flavor, high
  smoke point, and moderate saturated fat content. These differences make them unique
  and valuable in their own right within the category of edible vegetable oils.
