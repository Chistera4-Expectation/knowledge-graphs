text: As a dietician, I can provide insights into the nutritional aspects of these
  two food items but not make decisions on semantic and ontological duplicates. From
  a nutritional standpoint, ostrich nuggets and ostrich meat are similar, as both
  come from the same animal. However, their preparation and cooking methods may differ,
  and they may not be considered exact duplicates in a culinary context. Ultimately,
  the decision to merge or not merge them as duplicates in a semantic or ontological
  context would depend on the specific use case and the criteria established by the
  ontology developers.
