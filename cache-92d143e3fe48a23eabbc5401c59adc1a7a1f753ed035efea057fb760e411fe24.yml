text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are derived from poultry,
  specifically pheasant, they are different food items. Pheasant Gravy is a sauce
  made from pheasant, while Pheasant Thighs are a cut of meat from the bird. They
  serve different purposes in a meal and have distinct nutritional profiles.
