text: ' No. Cottonseed oil and olive oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they are both types of edible vegetable oils, they come from different plants
  (cottonseeds vs olives) and have distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses
  in cooking. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate instances in
  a knowledge graph or database.'
