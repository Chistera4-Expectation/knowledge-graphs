text: No, 'Purified Water' and 'Rain Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  differences in terms of origin and processing. Purified water undergoes a specific
  process to remove impurities, while rainwater is naturally collected from the atmosphere.
  These differences should be recognized and maintained in the classification system.
