  Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties and uses
  due to their different sources, nutrient profiles, and flavors. Avocado oil is known
  for its mild flavor and high smoke point, while sesame oil is prized for its nutty
  aroma and lower smoke point. Keeping them as separate instances allows for accurate
  representation of their unique characteristics.
