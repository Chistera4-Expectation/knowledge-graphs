text: ' "Lean Meats" would be the most adequate class to categorize lamb, along with
  other leaner meat options such as certain cuts of beef, pork, and poultry. This
  category emphasizes lower fat content and higher protein value, making it a more
  suitable option when compared to potentially fattier choices like processed pork
  products or certain types of red meat. However, even within this category, it is
  important to remember that portion control and selection of leaner cuts are key
  in maintaining a balanced diet.'
