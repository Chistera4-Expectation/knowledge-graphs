text: No, "Quail Gravy" and "Quail Thighs" should not be merged together as they are
  distinct food items made from different parts of the quail. Quail Gravy is a sauce
  made from the drippings of cooked quail, while Quail Thighs are a specific cut of
  meat from the quail bird. They have different nutritional profiles and cooking methods.
