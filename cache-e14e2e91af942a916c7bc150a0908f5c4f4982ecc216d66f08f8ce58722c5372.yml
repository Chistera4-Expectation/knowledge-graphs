text: As a dietician, my focus is primarily on the nutritional content and properties
  of food, rather than the classification of specific sauces. However, if we consider
  the semantic and ontological aspects, 'Aioli sauce' and 'Sriracha sauce' are different
  sauces with distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses. Therefore, they should not
  be merged as duplicates.
