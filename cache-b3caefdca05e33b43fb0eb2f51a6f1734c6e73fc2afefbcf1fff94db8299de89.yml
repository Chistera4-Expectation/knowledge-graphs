text: ' No. Basmati rice and wild rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They belong to different species of plants and
  have distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Basmati rice is a type of
  long-grain rice that originated in the Indian subcontinent, while wild rice is a
  grass native to North America that has been traditionally harvested by indigenous
  peoples. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions between these
  two types of grains.'
