text: No, Hemp Seed Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct types of edible vegetable oils with
  different nutritional profiles and uses. Hemp Seed Oil is derived from the seeds
  of the hemp plant, while Wheat Germ Oil comes from the germ of wheat kernels. They
  have different fatty acid compositions, nutrient contents, and applications in food
  and nutrition.
