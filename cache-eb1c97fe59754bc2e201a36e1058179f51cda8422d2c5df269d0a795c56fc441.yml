text: No, they should not be merged together. Flavored water and well water are distinct
  types of drinking water with different characteristics. Flavored water is typically
  bottled water with added natural or artificial flavors, while well water is water
  drawn from an underground aquifer. Although both can be considered drinking water,
  they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
