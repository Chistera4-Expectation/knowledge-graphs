  Although both artificial sweeteners (such as saccharin) and Stevia are used to add
  sweetness to food and drinks without adding calories like sugar does, they have
  important differences that make them distinct entities. Artificial sweeteners are
  synthetic substances manufactured through chemical processes, while Stevia is a
  naturally occurring compound extracted from the leaves of the Stevia rebaudiana
  plant. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates in a classification system for sweeteners.'
