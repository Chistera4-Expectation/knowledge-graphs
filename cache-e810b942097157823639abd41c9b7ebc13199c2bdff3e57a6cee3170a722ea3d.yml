text: 'No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics: Probiotic Yogurt
  contains live and active cultures that may provide health benefits, and Whole Milk
  Yogurt is made from full-fat milk, while Probiotic Yogurt could be made from low-fat
  or non-fat milk. These differences in ingredients and potential health benefits
  make them distinct types of yogurt.'
