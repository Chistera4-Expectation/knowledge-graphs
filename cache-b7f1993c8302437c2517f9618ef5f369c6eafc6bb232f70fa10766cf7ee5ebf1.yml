text: No, 'Fried Plantains' and 'Fried Taro Dumplings' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are fried dishes, they are made
  from different ingredients (plantains vs. taro) and have distinct culinary preparations
  and cultural associations. They are separate instances within the Edible Vegetable
  class.
