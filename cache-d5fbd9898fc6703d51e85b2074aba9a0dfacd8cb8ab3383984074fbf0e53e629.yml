text: ' It is difficult to determine the most adequate "Filling" from the given list
  without additional context, as different individuals have unique nutritional needs
  and preferences. However, if we are looking for a filling food group that provides
  essential nutrients, I would suggest "Edible Vegetables," "Whole Grains (such as
  Rice or Pasta Types)," or "Protein Sources (such as Beef, Pork-derived Food, Poultry-derived
  Food, Edible Crustaceans, Edible Fish, Cheese, Butter, Milk, and Nuts/Seeds)." These
  food groups contain various vitamins, minerals, fiber, and protein, which contribute
  to satiety and overall health.'
