text: No, the instances 'Grape juice' and 'Strawberry juice' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of juice
  made from distinct fruits, each with its own nutritional profile and characteristics.
  While they may share some commonalities as fruit juices, they remain distinct instances
  within the Juice class.
