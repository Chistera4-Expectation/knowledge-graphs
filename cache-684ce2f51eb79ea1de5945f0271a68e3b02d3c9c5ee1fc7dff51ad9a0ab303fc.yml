text: ' No. Creamed honey and raw wildflower honey are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged together. They refer to different types of honey
  products with unique characteristics.


  Creamed honey is made by controlling the crystallization process of liquid honey,
  resulting in a spreadable consistency with fine crystals. On the other hand, raw
  wildflower honey is unprocessed honey collected from various flower sources found
  in nature, which retains its natural enzymes, pollens, and aromas. Although both
  contain honey, they have distinct production methods and qualities that make them
  separate entities within the honey class.'
