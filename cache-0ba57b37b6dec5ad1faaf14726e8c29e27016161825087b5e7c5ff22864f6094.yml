text: No, they should not be merged. Although they both fall under the Poultry-derived
  Food class, 'Duck Patties' and 'Turkey Patties' are distinct types of poultry patties
  with different nutritional profiles and characteristics. Merging them would cause
  confusion and loss of information about each specific type of poultry patty.
