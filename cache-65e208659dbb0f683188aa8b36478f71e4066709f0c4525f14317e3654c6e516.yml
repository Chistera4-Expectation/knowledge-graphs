text: No, Hard cider and Hard seltzer should not be merged together as they are different
  types of alcoholic beverages with distinct ingredients and processes. Hard cider
  is made from fermented apple juice, while Hard seltzer is made from carbonated water,
  alcohol, and flavorings. They are separate categories within the Alcoholic Drink
  class.
