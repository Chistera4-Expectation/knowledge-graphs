text: No, Turkey Breast and Turkey Sausage should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from turkey, they have
  different nutritional profiles and cooking methods. Turkey breast is a leaner cut
  of meat with less fat and sodium than turkey sausage, which often contains added
  fat and sodium from seasonings and other ingredients. Therefore, they should be
  treated as distinct food items in the Poultry-derived Food class.
