text: ' "Food Additives > Sodium Phosphates" or simply "Sodium Phosphates" would be
  an appropriate class name as it specifically refers to the additive and not the
  food items themselves. However, if you want to keep it more general, you could use
  "Processed Foods > Additives > Sodium Phosphates." This includes foods that may
  naturally contain sodium phosphates (such as edible crustaceans) but primarily focuses
  on processed foods where sodium phosphates are added as an ingredient.'
