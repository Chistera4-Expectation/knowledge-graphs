  While both 'Pork Belly' and 'Pork' are derived from pigs, they are different cuts
  of meat with distinct nutritional and culinary properties. 'Pork Belly' specifically
  refers to the fatty, boneless cut of meat from the belly of the pig, whereas 'Pork'
  is a more general term that can refer to various cuts of meat from the pig, such
  as pork chops, pork loin, or pork tenderloin. Therefore, they should be treated
  as separate instances within the Pork-derived Food class.
