text: No, Glutinous Rice and Short-grain Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics,
  textures, and uses in cooking. Glutinous Rice is known for its sticky and chewy
  texture, while Short-grain Rice is known for its slightly sticky texture and is
  commonly used in dishes like sushi and risotto.
