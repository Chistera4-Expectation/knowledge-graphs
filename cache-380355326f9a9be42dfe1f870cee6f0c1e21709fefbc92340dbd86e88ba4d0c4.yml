text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Ostrich Eggs" and "Ostrich
  Tenders" are derived from ostriches, they are distinct food items with different
  nutritional properties and uses in recipes. Merging them as duplicates would not
  accurately represent the information in the Poultry-derived Food class.
