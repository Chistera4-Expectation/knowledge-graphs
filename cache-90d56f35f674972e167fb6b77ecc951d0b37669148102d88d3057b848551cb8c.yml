text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Breadcrumbs" and "Graham
  cracker crumbs" are types of crumbs, they are made from different sources (bread
  and graham crackers, respectively). They have different nutritional profiles and
  uses in recipes, so they should remain as separate instances in the Bread class.
