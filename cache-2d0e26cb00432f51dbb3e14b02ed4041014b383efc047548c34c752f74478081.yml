text: No, Argan Oil and Coconut Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties,
  uses, and origins. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique characteristics
  and would lead to confusion.
