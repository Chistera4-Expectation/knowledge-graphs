  While both roasted and smoked turkey are types of prepared poultry dishes, they
  differ in their preparation methods (roasting vs smoking) and may also have different
  nutritional profiles due to differences in cooking techniques. Therefore, it is
  appropriate to keep them as separate entities within the Poultry-derived Food class.'
