text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Guinea Fowl
  Broth and Guinea Fowl Thighs are different food products made from the same animal
  (Guinea Fowl), but they have distinct properties and uses in cooking. Broth is a
  liquid made from simmering ingredients in water, while thighs are a specific cut
  of meat. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
