  While both ''beef'' and ''organic beef'' are types of meat that come from cows,
  they differ in terms of their production methods and regulations governing them.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.


  ''Beef'' generally refers to the flesh of cattle used for food, regardless of how
  the animal was raised or what it was fed. On the other hand, ''organic beef'' is
  a specific type of beef that comes from cattle that have been raised according to
  strict organic standards, including being given access to pasture and being fed
  organic feed without the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), synthetic
  pesticides, or antibiotics or growth hormones. Organic beef also requires third-party
  certification to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.


  Therefore, while there may be some overlap between the categories of beef and organic
  beef, they represent distinct concepts within the domain of nutrition and agriculture,
  and merging them would result in a loss of important information about the differences
  between these two types of products.'
