text: No, "Chicken Tenders" and "Turkey Tenders" should not be merged together as
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Although they share the word "tenders"
  and are both derived from poultry, they are different types of poultry meat with
  distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses.
