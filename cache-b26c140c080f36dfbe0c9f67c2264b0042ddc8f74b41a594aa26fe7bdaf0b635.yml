text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of yogurt with different
  characteristics. Icelandic yogurt, also known as skyr, has a thicker texture and
  higher protein content, while low-fat yogurt has a lower fat content compared to
  regular yogurt. These differences make them unique and not semantic or ontological
  duplicates.
