text: As a dietician, I would say no, the instances 'Brown sauce' and 'Chimichurri
  sauce' should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While
  they both are sauces, they have different ingredients, flavors, and uses in culinary
  contexts. Merging them would lead to a loss of information and potentially incorrect
  dietary advice.
