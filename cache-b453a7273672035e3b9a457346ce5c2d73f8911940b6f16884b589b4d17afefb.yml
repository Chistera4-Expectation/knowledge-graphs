  While both Blueberry Honey and Organic Clover Honey fall under the category of "Honey,"
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct characteristics
  based on their source: blueberry blossoms for Blueberry Honey and clover plants
  for Organic Clover Honey. These differences can impact taste, color, consistency,
  and potentially health benefits, making them unique within the broader classification
  of honey.'
