text: No, the instances 'Pickled vegetables' and 'Vegetable' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Pickled vegetables' refers to a
  specific preparation of vegetables, while 'Vegetable' is a more general category
  that includes many types of plants used as food. Although both are related to edible
  vegetables, they have different meanings and should be kept separate.
