text: No, Hemp Milk and Pea Milk should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both plant-based milk alternatives, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles and come from different plant sources (hemp seeds and peas,
  respectively). They should be treated as separate instances within the Milk class.
