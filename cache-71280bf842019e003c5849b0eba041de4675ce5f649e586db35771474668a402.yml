text: ' Among the given options, none directly refer to Tocopherols as their primary
  component. Tocopherols are actually a type of Vitamin E antioxidant found in various
  foods. Therefore, the most suitable class for "Antioxidants: Tocopherols" would
  be "Food". However, if we need to specify further, we could say "Rich Food Sources
  of Vitamin E (Tocopherols)".'
