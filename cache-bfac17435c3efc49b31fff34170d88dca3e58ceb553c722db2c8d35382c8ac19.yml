  Curry powder and sherry vinegar are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  have different ingredients, flavors, uses, and origins. Curry powder is typically
  made from a blend of spices like turmeric, coriander, cumin, and chili peppers,
  while sherry vinegar is produced by aging sherry wine in oak barrels with acetic
  acid bacteria. Merging them would result in confusion and incorrect categorization.'
