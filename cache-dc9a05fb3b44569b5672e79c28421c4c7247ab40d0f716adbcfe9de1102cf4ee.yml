text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  they are both types of sauces, they have different ingredients, flavors, and uses.
  Brown sauce typically has a savory flavor and is used as a condiment for savory
  dishes, while Piri Piri sauce is spicy and often used in marinades and as a dip
  for grilled meats. Merging them would not accurately represent the distinctions
  between the two sauces.
