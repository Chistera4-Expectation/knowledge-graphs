text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are derived from poultry,
  specifically chicken, they have different nutritional profiles and preparation methods.
  Chicken breast is a leaner cut of meat with less fat and calories, while chicken
  sausage often contains additional ingredients and can vary in fat content depending
  on the brand and type of sausage. These differences make them distinct instances
  in the Poultry-derived Food class.
