text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are vinegars, they have
  different flavors, uses, and origins. Black vinegar is made from fermented glutinous
  rice and has a dark color with a smoky, sweet, and acidic flavor. It is commonly
  used in Chinese cuisine. Rice vinegar, on the other hand, is made from fermented
  rice and has a lighter color and a milder, sweeter flavor. It is often used in Japanese
  and Korean cuisine. Merging them together would not accurately represent their distinct
  characteristics.
