text: No, the instances 'Turkey Nuggets' and 'Turkey' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from turkey, they are
  different products. Turkey Nuggets are processed and formed into nugget shapes,
  whereas 'Turkey' refers to the unprocessed meat or whole bird. These distinctions
  are important for dietary and nutritional considerations.
