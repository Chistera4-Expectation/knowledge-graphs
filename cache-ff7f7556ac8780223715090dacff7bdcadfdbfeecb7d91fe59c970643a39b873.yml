  While black vinegar and sherry vinegar may have some similar uses in cooking, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different flavors, ingredients,
  and origins, and can result in different tastes when used in recipes. Black vinegar
  is typically made from glutinous rice or wheat and has a deep, rich flavor with
  a hint of sweetness. Sherry vinegar, on the other hand, is made from sherry wine
  and tends to have a more complex, nutty, and acidic taste. Therefore, it is important
  for them to remain separate categories in a food seasoning class.'
