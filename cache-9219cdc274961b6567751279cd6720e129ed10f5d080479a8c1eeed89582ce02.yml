text: No, 'Forbidden Rice' (also known as Black Rice) and 'Parboiled Rice' are different
  types of rice and should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Forbidden
  Rice is a whole grain, high in antioxidants and fiber, while Parboiled Rice is partially
  precooked, making it easier to cook and less sticky than other types of rice. These
  two types of rice have different nutritional profiles and cooking characteristics,
  so they should remain as distinct instances in the Rice class.
