  While both are types of yogurt, they have distinct differences in ingredients and
  nutritional content. Skyr Yogurt is typically made with skim milk and has a higher
  protein content, while Vegan Yogurt is made from plant-based ingredients and does
  not contain dairy. These differences make them unique instances within the Yogurt
  class.
