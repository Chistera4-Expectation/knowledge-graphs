text: ' No. Grated Parmesan cheese and Parmesan cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, although they are related. Grated Parmesan cheese is a specific form
  of Parmesan cheese that has been grated into smaller pieces, while Parmesan cheese
  refers to the general type of Italian cheese. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as duplicates.'
