text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both "Quail Gravy" and "Quail Soup" are poultry-derived foods, they are distinct
  dishes with different ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the distinct entities within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
