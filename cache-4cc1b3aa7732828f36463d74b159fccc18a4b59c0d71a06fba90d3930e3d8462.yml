text: No, Avocado Oil and Safflower Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have different
  chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, and uses. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the distinct properties of each oil.
