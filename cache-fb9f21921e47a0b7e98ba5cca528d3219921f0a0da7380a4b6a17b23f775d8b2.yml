  However, I can provide some information on these types of water.


  Artisanal water and well water are not exactly semantic and ontologic duplicates,
  as they refer to different sources of water. Artisanal water typically refers to
  water that is bottled directly from a natural source, such as a spring, and is often
  marketed for its unique taste or mineral content. Well water, on the other hand,
  is extracted from an underground aquifer through a well and is often used for domestic
  or agricultural purposes.


  While both types of water can be considered natural, they come from different sources
  and may have distinct characteristics. Therefore, it would not be accurate to merge
  these instances as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
