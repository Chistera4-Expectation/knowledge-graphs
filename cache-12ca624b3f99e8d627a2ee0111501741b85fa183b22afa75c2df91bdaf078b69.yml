text: No, they should not be merged as they have different properties and uses in
  cooking. Curry sauce is typically a spiced sauce used with curry dishes, while Tempura
  Dipping Sauce is a sauce specifically used for dipping tempura dishes. Although
  they both belong to the sauce category, they serve different purposes and have distinct
  ingredients and flavors.
