  The instances ''Date Syrup'' and ''Rice Syrup'' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both syrups, they are made
  from different ingredients and have different nutritional profiles. Date syrup is
  made from dates, while rice syrup is made from rice.'
