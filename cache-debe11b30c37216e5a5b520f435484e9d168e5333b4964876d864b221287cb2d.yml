text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are types of yogurt, they have different characteristics and flavors. Australian
  Yogurt may refer to a specific brand or type of yogurt originating from Australia,
  while Fruit-Flavored Yogurt refers to yogurt with added fruit flavors, regardless
  of its origin. They can coexist as separate instances within the Yogurt class.
