text: ' No. Although both "Fresh raw fish" and "Salted fish" belong to the same general
  category of edible fish, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They represent
  different stages of processing and preservation for fish, which can significantly
  affect their taste, texture, nutritional content, and culinary uses. Merging them
  would result in loss of important distinctions that are relevant to consumers, chefs,
  and nutritionists alike.'
