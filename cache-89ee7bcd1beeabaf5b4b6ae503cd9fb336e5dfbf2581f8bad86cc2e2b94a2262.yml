text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of butter, they
  have different characteristics that are significant for dietary purposes. Grass-fed
  butter is made from the milk of cows that primarily eat grass, which can impact
  the nutritional profile of the butter. Lactose-free butter, on the other hand, is
  made specifically for individuals who cannot tolerate lactose. Merging them would
  lose these important distinctions.
