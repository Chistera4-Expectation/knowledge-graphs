text: No, Argan Oil and Rice Bran Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different
  nutritional profiles, sources, and uses. Argan Oil is primarily sourced from the
  Argan tree in Morocco and is rich in vitamin E, antioxidants, and fatty acids. Rice
  Bran Oil is derived from the bran layer of rice grains and contains high levels
  of vitamin E, antioxidants, and unsaturated fats. They serve different purposes
  in cooking and health applications.
