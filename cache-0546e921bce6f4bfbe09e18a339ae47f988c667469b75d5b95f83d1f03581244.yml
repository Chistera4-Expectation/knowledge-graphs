text: ' "Red Meat" would be the most appropriate class for "Lamb," as it falls into
  this category along with beef and pork. Red meat is characterized by its red color,
  which comes from myoglobin, a protein that stores oxygen in muscle tissue. This
  group of meats generally contains more fat and cholesterol compared to white meat
  like chicken or turkey. However, lamb can also be classified under "Mutton" if referring
  specifically to adult sheep meat.'
