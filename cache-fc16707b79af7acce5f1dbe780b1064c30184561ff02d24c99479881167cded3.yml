  The instances ''Instances of the Bread class'' and ''Whole Wheat Bread'' are not
  semantic and ontologic duplicates, as they represent different concepts:


  * **Instances of the Bread class**: This is a group of instances that belong to
  the Bread class. It includes all instances of bread, regardless of their specific
  type or ingredients.

  * **Whole Wheat Bread**: This is a specific type of bread made from whole wheat
  flour. It is an instance of the Bread class and a subclass of the Whole Wheat Bread
  class.


  Therefore, the two instances are not semantic or ontologic duplicates, as they represent
  different concepts.'
