text: No, Morel Mushroom and Velvet Pioppini Mushroom should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are distinct species of mushrooms with
  different appearances, flavors, and properties. Morels (Morchella spp.) are highly
  prized for their honeycomb-like caps, while Velvet Pioppini (Agrocybe aegerita)
  have a velvety, dark brown cap and are known for their mild, nutty flavor. These
  differences warrant separate instances in the Edible Mushrooms class.
