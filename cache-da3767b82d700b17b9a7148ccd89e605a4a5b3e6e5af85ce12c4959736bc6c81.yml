text: No, 'Clover Honey' and 'Wildflower Honey' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are different types of honey with distinct flavors and
  characteristics based on the types of flowers the bees gather nectar from. Clover
  Honey comes from bees that primarily gather nectar from clover flowers, while Wildflower
  Honey comes from bees that gather nectar from a variety of wildflowers. These differences
  make them distinct types of honey.
