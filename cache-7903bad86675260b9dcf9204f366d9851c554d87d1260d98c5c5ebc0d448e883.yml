  While both "chicken curry" and "chicken pot pie" contain chicken as their main ingredient,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they differ significantly
  in terms of their preparation methods, ingredients used, cultural origins, and regional
  variations. Chicken curry typically involves cooking chicken with various spices
  and herbs to create a flavorful sauce, while chicken pot pie is made by encasing
  cooked chicken, vegetables, and gravy within pastry crusts. These dishes cater to
  different tastes and occasions, making them distinct entities in poultry-derived
  food classification.'
