text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of sauces with different
  ingredients and uses. Hollandaise sauce is a butter-based sauce typically used for
  eggs Benedict and vegetables, while soy sauce is a fermented soybean-based condiment
  used in Asian cuisine. Although they are both sauces, they have different properties
  and uses.
