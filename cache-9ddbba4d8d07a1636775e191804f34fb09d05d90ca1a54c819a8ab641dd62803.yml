text: No, they should not be merged. Although both instances belong to the Edible
  Fish class, they represent different forms and preparations of fish. Fish fillet
  refers to a boneless piece of fish that is usually cooked, while sushi-grade fish
  is a higher quality fish that is suitable for eating raw in sushi dishes. They have
  different culinary uses and may have different nutritional values depending on their
  specific fish species and preparations.
