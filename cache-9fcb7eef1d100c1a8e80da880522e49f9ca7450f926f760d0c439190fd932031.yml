text: As a dietician, my answer is that 'Multigrain Bread' and 'Sourdough Bread' are
  not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the Bread class,
  they have distinct characteristics, ingredients, and nutritional profiles. Merging
  them would not accurately represent these differences.
