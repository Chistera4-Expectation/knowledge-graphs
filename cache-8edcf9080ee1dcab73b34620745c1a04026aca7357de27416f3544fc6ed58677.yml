text: ' No. While both "Name of the cheese" and "Shredded mozzarella cheese" are related
  to cheese, they do not represent the same concept and cannot be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates. "Name of the cheese" is a general term that refers to
  any type of cheese, whereas "shredded mozzarella cheese" is a specific type of cheese
  (mozzarella) that has been shredded for a particular use.'
