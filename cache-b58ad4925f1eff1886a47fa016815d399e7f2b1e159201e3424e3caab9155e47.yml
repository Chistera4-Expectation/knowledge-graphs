text: No, Quail Soup and Turkey Soup should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are soups made from poultry, they are distinct
  dishes made from different types of birds. The nutritional content, flavor, and
  preparation methods for each soup can vary significantly. Merging them together
  would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each dish.
