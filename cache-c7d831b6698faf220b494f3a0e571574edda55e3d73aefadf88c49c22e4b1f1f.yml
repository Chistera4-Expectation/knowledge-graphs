  While both raw fish and dry fish are types of edible fish, they refer to different
  preparations and can have distinct nutritional profiles. Raw fish is unprocessed
  and uncooked, while dry fish has been preserved through a process such as sun-drying
  or smoking. Therefore, merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates would
  not accurately reflect their differences.'
