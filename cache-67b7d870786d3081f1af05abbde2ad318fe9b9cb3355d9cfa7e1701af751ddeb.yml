  While both Pheasant Meatballs and Pheasant Patties are made from poultry-derived
  pheasant meat, they are different preparations with distinct shapes and cooking
  methods, which can impact their nutritional profile and culinary use. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
