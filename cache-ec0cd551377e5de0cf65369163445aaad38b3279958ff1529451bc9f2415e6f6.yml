  While balsamic vinegar and black vinegar may have some similarities as types of
  vinegars used for flavoring food, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They come from different sources (balsamic is made from grapes while black vinegar
  can be made from various ingredients such as rice, wheat, or sorghum), have distinct
  tastes and uses, and originate from different regions (Italy vs. China). Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as duplicates.'
