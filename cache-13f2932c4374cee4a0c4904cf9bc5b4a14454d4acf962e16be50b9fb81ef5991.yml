  While chili oil and grapeseed oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have different properties and uses, so they should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Chili oil is made by infusing oil with chili peppers, resulting
  in an oil that has a spicy flavor, while grapeseed oil is extracted from the seeds
  of grapes and has a light, neutral taste. Therefore, these two oils serve distinct
  culinary purposes and should be treated as separate entities within the category
  of edible vegetable oils.'
