text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although they both are types of yogurt, they have different properties and characteristics
  due to the addition of fruit flavoring in the "Fruit-Flavored Yogurt" instance.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between these two types
  of yogurt.
