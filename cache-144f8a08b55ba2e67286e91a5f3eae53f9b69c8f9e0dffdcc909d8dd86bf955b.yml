text: ' No. Although both Alfalfa honey and Organic clover honey are types of honey,
  they have different properties depending on the plant nectar source. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Each
  type of honey has its unique characteristics that may impact their nutritional content
  and flavor profile, making it important to distinguish between them for consumers
  seeking specific qualities in their food products.'
