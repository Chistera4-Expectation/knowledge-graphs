  While both chili oil and corn oil are types of edible oils, they have different
  ingredients and uses. Chili oil is typically made by infusing vegetable oil with
  chili peppers, while corn oil is extracted directly from the germ of corn plants.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
