text: No, Dungeness Crab and Mitten Crab should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both edible crustaceans, they are distinct
  species with different characteristics, habitats, and cultural significance. Merging
  them would result in a loss of specific information and confusion.
