  While both Chili Pepper and Kashmiri Chili Powder may share some similarities (e.g.,
  they are both spicy), they have distinct differences that make them non-duplicate
  entities. Chili pepper refers to the actual fruit of the Capsicum plant species,
  which is used fresh, dried, or ground into various forms such as flakes or powders.
  On the other hand, Kashmiri chili powder specifically refers to a type of ground
  chili pepper originating from the Kashmir region, with unique flavor profiles and
  color characteristics compared to other types of chilies or chili powders. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
