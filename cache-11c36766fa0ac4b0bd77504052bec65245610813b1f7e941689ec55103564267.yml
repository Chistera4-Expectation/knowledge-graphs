text: ' No. While both "Coffee" and "''brand'': The brand of the coffee" are related
  to coffee, they represent different aspects of it. "Coffee" generally refers to
  the drink itself, whereas "''brand''" denotes the specific company that produces
  the coffee. Merging them would not accurately reflect their distinct concepts.'
