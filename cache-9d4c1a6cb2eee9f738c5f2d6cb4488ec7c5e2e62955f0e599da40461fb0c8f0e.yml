text: No, the instances 'Mushrooms' and 'Portobello Mushroom' should not be merged
  as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While Portobello mushrooms are
  a specific type of edible mushroom, they are not the same as the general category
  of mushrooms. Merging these two instances would result in a loss of specificity
  and accuracy in describing the different types of mushrooms.
