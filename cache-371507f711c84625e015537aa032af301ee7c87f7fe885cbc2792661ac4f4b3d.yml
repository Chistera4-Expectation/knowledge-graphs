text: No, these instances should not be merged as they represent different types of
  poultry-derived food products. Guinea Fowl Sausage refers to a sausage made from
  ground guinea fowl meat, while Guinea Fowl Tenders refer to pieces of boneless,
  skinless guinea fowl meat that are typically prepared by breading and frying. Although
  both products are derived from guinea fowl, they have distinct characteristics and
  preparation methods.
