  While poppy seed dressing and Russian dressing may have some similarities, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They differ in ingredients, flavors,
  textures, and culinary uses. Merging them would lose this important information.
  For example, poppy seed dressing typically includes poppy seeds, vinegar, oil, sugar,
  and sometimes onion or mustard, while Russian dressing is usually made with mayonnaise,
  ketchup, relish, and spices. These differences can significantly affect how each
  dressing tastes, looks, and functions in recipes.'
