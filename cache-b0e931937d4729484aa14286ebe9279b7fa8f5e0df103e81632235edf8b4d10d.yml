text: As a dietician, my expertise lies in nutrition and not in the field of ontology
  and semantics. However, from a culinary perspective, 'Pheasant Patties' and 'Pheasant'
  are not the same. 'Pheasant' refers to the bird itself, while 'Pheasant Patties'
  are a specific preparation of ground pheasant meat that is shaped into patties,
  often for consumption. Therefore, they should not be merged as duplicates.
