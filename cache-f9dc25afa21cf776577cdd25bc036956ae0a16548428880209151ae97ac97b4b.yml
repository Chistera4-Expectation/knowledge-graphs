text: As a dietician, my primary concern would be the nutritional value and ingredients
  of the sauces. However, from a semantic and ontological standpoint, these two sauces
  can be considered distinct, as they have different flavor profiles and potentially
  different ingredients. Chili sauce and Scotch bonnet pepper sauce may share some
  common ingredients like chili peppers, but the specific type of chili pepper used
  in Scotch bonnet pepper sauce (Scotch bonnet peppers) gives it a unique flavor and
  heat level compared to other chili sauces. Therefore, I would say no, these instances
  should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
