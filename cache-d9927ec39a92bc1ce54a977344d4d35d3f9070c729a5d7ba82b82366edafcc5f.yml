text: No, 'Chicken Sausage' and 'Pheasant Sausage' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of sausages made from poultry,
  they come from different bird species (chicken and pheasant, respectively) and may
  have different nutritional profiles, ingredients, and flavor characteristics.
