text: Yes, as a dietician, I would recommend merging 'Cumin seeds' and 'Cumin' as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates, as they both refer to the same spice. The difference
  lies in the form of the spice, with 'Cumin seeds' being the whole, dried seeds and
  'Cumin' being the ground version of the spice. However, they are the same spice
  and can be considered duplicates in the context of categorization.
