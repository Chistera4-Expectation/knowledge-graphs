text: As a dietician, I would recommend that the instances 'Tartar sauce' and 'Tomato
  sauce' should not be merged together. Although they both contain the word "sauce,"
  they are distinctly different in terms of ingredients, nutritional value, and usage.
  Tartar sauce is typically made with mayonnaise, pickles, and capers, while tomato
  sauce is made from tomatoes, herbs, and spices. Therefore, they should remain separate
  instances in the Sauce class.
