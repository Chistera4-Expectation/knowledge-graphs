text: ' "Edible Sweet" would be the most appropriate class for chocolate from the
  list you provided. This is because chocolate is typically considered a sweet food,
  and it fits into this category better than any of the others listed (such as alcoholic
  drink, beef, bread, etc.). It is also important to note that while chocolate does
  contain some nutrients, such as fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and zinc,
  it is generally not considered a healthy food due to its high sugar and fat content.
  As with all foods, it is best to enjoy chocolate in moderation as part of a balanced
  diet.'
