text: ' No. Avocado oil and coconut oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates because they are distinctly different types of edible
  vegetable oils with unique nutritional profiles and culinary uses. While both can
  be used for cooking and have health benefits, avocado oil is high in monounsaturated
  fats, vitamin E, and has a higher smoke point than coconut oil, making it suitable
  for sauteing and roasting at higher temperatures. On the other hand, coconut oil
  contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which may offer specific health advantages
  such as improved cognitive function and weight management. Merging these two instances
  would result in loss of important distinctions between them.'
