text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both coconut milk and nut milk
  can be considered milk-like beverages, they are derived from different sources (coconuts
  and nuts, respectively) and have different nutritional profiles. They can be classified
  under the same category, but they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
