text: ' No. While both red wine and rice wine are types of alcoholic drinks, they
  have different ingredients, flavors, and origins. Red wine is made from grapes,
  while rice wine is typically made from fermented rice. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
