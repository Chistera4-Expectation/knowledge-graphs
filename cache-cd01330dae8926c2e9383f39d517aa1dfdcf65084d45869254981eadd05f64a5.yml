text: No, Turkey Breast and Turkey Liver should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are different parts of the turkey with distinct nutritional profiles
  and culinary uses. Turkey Breast is a leaner, white meat, while Turkey Liver is
  a richer, darker meat with higher fat content. These differences warrant separate
  instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
