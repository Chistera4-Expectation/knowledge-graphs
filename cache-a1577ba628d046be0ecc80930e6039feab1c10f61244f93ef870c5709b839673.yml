text: ' No, Catfish and Salted fish should not be merged together as they are not
  semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are types of edible fish, they have
  different characteristics, preparation methods, and uses. Catfish is a freshwater
  or saltwater fish with whisker-like barbels around its mouth, while Salted fish
  refers to any type of fish that has been preserved through salting and drying. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them as separate instances within the Edible Fish class.'
