text: No, these instances should not be merged together. While they are both sausages
  derived from poultry, guinea fowl and ostrich are different species of birds with
  distinct nutritional profiles and culinary characteristics. Therefore, they should
  be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
