text: ' "Insect-Derived Food" would be the most appropriate class for mealworms. This
  is because mealworms are a type of insect, and including them in this category allows
  for clear and accurate classification of this food source. Honey, on the other hand,
  is a sweet substance produced by honeybees, which falls into a different category
  altogether.'
