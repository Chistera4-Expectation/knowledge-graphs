text: ' No. Idli rice, which is also known as parboiled rice, and long-grain rice
  are not semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they can both be classified
  under the general category of "rice," they have distinct properties and uses. Idli
  rice is specifically treated with steam before milling to make it easier to digest
  and more resistant to weevils, while long-grain rice has a slender shape and tends
  to remain separate when cooked, making it ideal for certain dishes like pilafs and
  stir-fries.'
