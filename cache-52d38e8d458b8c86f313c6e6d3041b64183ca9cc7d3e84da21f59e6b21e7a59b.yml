  In this case, "Gluten-free bread" and "Panko breadcrumbs" are not duplicate instances.
  They are two different types of baked goods with distinct ingredients, textures,
  and uses in cooking. Gluten-free bread is made without gluten, which is a protein
  found in wheat, barley, and rye, while Panko breadcrumbs are made from crustless
  white bread and have a lighter, airier texture than traditional breadcrumbs. These
  differences make them separate entities in the Bread class, rather than duplicates.'
