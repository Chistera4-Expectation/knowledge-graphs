  Avocado oil and vegetable oil are different types of edible oils with distinct nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking. Avocado oil is extracted from the fruit of the avocado
  tree and has a higher smoke point than vegetable oil, making it more suitable for
  high-heat cooking. Vegetable oil, on the other hand, is a blend of various plant-based
  oils and may contain a combination of unsaturated and saturated fats. It is generally
  less expensive than avocado oil but has a lower smoke point, making it less ideal
  for high-heat cooking. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
