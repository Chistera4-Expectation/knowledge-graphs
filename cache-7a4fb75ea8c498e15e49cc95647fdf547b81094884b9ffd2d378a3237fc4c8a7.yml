text: ' No, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. While "Creamy Italian
  Dressing" and "Italian Dressing" may share some similarities in ingredients or taste
  profile, they represent distinct types of dressings with different characteristics.
  Creamy Italian Dressing contains cream or other dairy products that give it a thicker
  consistency than traditional Italian Dressing which is typically made from olive
  oil, vinegar, garlic, herbs, and spices.'
