text: No, these two instances should not be merged together. Green bell pepper is
  a vegetable, while rice paper wrappers are an edible food item used to wrap other
  ingredients, typically for dishes such as spring rolls. Although they both fall
  under the category of "edible vegetable class," they serve different purposes and
  have distinct properties.
