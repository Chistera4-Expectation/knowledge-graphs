  While both chicken nuggets and chicken pot pie are poultry-derived foods, they have
  different culinary preparations and thus cannot be considered semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Chicken nuggets typically consist of bite-sized pieces of chicken meat
  that are breaded and fried, while chicken pot pie is a savory dish featuring diced
  chicken and mixed vegetables in a flaky pastry crust. Merging them would not accurately
  reflect their unique identities and uses within various cuisines.'
