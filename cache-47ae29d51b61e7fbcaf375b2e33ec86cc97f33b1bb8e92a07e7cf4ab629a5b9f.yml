text: No, these two instances should not be merged together. Chinese five-spice powder
  and coriander powder are distinct spice blends with unique ingredients and flavor
  profiles. Chinese five-spice powder typically contains a combination of star anise,
  cloves, cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds, while coriander powder is made
  from ground coriander seeds. Although both are used in cooking and can be classified
  as spices, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
