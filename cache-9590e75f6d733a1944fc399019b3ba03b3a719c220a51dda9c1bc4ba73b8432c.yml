text: No, 'Quail Eggs' and 'Quail Thighs' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct parts of the quail, with different
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. 'Quail Eggs' are a source of protein, vitamins,
  and minerals, while 'Quail Thighs' are a lean source of protein with a unique taste
  and texture. Merging them would not accurately represent their differences.
