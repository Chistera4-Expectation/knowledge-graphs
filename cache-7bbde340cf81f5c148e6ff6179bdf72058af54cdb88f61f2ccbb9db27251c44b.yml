text: No, Cremini Mushroom and Shiitake Mushroom should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct species of mushrooms with different
  characteristics, flavors, and nutritional profiles. Cremini Mushrooms (Agaricus
  bisporus) are a type of button mushroom, while Shiitake Mushrooms (Lentinula edodes)
  are an entirely different species with unique culinary and medicinal properties.
  Although they both belong to the class Edible Mushrooms, they are not duplicates.
