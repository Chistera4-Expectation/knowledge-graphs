text: No, they should not be merged together as they have distinct properties and
  characteristics. Clover honey is a type of honey produced from the nectar of clover
  flowers, while Tupelo honey is produced from the nectar of tupelo trees. These two
  types of honey have different flavor profiles, production methods, and nutritional
  values. Therefore, they should be treated as separate entities in a honey class.
