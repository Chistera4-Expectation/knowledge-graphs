text: As a dietician, I can provide an opinion based on the nutritional aspects. From
  a nutritional standpoint, fresh mozzarella and mozzarella cheese are not exact duplicates,
  as the fresh version typically has a higher moisture content and lower sodium content
  compared to aged or dried mozzarella cheese. Therefore, they can be considered as
  different types of cheese with distinct nutritional profiles. However, from a semantic
  and ontologic perspective, if the differences between the two types of cheese are
  not relevant to the context of the classification, it might make sense to merge
  them as duplicates.
