text: No, they should not be merged. 'Flavored Butter' and 'Organic Butter' are different
  types of butter, with different properties. 'Flavored Butter' refers to butter with
  added flavors, while 'Organic Butter' refers to butter made from organically produced
  ingredients. These two types of butter should be kept as separate instances in the
  Butter class.
