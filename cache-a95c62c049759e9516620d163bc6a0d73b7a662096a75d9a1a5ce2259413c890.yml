text: No, "Rye Bread" and "Soda Bread" should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of bread, they have distinct
  characteristics and ingredients. Rye Bread is made primarily from rye flour, while
  Soda Bread is made from wheat flour and uses baking soda as a leavening agent. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the differences between these two types of bread.
