text: No, 'Sparkling Water' and 'Well Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct types of drinking water with different
  characteristics and origins. Sparkling water is artificially or naturally carbonated,
  while well water is sourced from underground aquifers.
