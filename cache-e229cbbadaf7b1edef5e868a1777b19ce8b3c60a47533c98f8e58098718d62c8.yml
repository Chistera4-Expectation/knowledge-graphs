text: ' No. Alfalfa honey and Tupelo honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They have different botanical
  origins, taste profiles, and properties due to their distinct nectar sources (alfalfa
  flowers vs tupelo trees). Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate
  instances that convey accurate information about each type of honey.'
