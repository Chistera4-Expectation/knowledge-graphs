  While both ''beef'' and ''grass-fed beef'' are types of meat derived from cattle,
  they have distinct differences in terms of nutrition, production methods, and flavor
  profiles that make them non-duplicate entities. Grass-fed beef comes from cattle
  raised on grass and forage diets, while conventional beef may come from grain-finished
  animals. These differences lead to variations in nutritional content (such as fatty
  acid composition), environmental impact, animal welfare considerations, and taste
  preferences, justifying their separate classification within the domain of food
  and nutrition.'
