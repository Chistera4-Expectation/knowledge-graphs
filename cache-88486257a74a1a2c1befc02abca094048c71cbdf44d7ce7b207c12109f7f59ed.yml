  Safflower oil and vegetable oil are not exact duplicates, as they have different
  chemical compositions and nutritional profiles. Safflower oil is primarily composed
  of monounsaturated fats, while vegetable oil can be a blend of various oils and
  may contain a mix of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats. Additionally,
  safflower oil has a distinct flavor and color that sets it apart from other edible
  oils. Therefore, keeping them separate as individual instances in the Edible Vegetal
  Oil class is appropriate.'
