text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both Plant-based Butter and Spreadable Butter can be considered types of butter,
  they differ in their composition and source. Plant-based Butter is made from plant-based
  ingredients, while Spreadable Butter typically contains dairy products and is designed
  to be more spreadable at room temperature. Therefore, they represent distinct categories
  and should not be merged.
