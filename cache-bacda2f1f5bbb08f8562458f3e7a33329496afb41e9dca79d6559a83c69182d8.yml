  The two instances, "Carrots, peeled" and "bacon bits, diced vegetables," are not
  identical in their meaning and composition, even though they both belong to the
  same class of edible vegetables. Carrots are a specific type of root vegetable,
  while bacon bits are a processed food made from various vegetables (such as potatoes,
  carrots, onions) that have been cooked and seasoned with bacon flavor. They have
  different nutritional profiles, textures, and culinary uses, so it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
