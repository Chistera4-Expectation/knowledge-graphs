text: No, they should not be merged together. Almond milk is a plant-based milk alternative,
  while Sheep's milk is an animal-based milk product. They have different nutritional
  profiles, production methods, and uses. Merging them would not accurately represent
  their distinct characteristics and would be misleading for dietary purposes.
