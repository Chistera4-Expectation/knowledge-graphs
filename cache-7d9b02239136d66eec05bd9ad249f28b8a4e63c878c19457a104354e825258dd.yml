text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they are both derived from
  turkey, they are different food items with distinct preparation methods and nutritional
  profiles. Turkeys nuggets are a processed food typically made from ground turkey
  meat and may contain additional ingredients, while turkey soup is a liquid dish
  made by simmering turkey meat, vegetables, and other ingredients in water or broth.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent the differences in their composition,
  preparation, and usage.
