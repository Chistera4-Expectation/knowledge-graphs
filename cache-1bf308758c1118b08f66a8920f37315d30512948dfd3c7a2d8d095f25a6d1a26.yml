text: No, Almond Oil and Chili Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates because they are different types of edible oils with distinct properties,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Almond Oil is derived from almonds and is typically
  used in cosmetics and as a carrier oil in aromatherapy, while Chili Oil is made
  from chili peppers and is used as a condiment or flavoring agent in cooking.
