text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both are types of milk, they have different sources and nutritional profiles. Camel
  milk comes from camels, while pea milk is derived from yellow peas. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the distinct characteristics of each type of milk.
