text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Chili oil
  and Extra Virgin Olive Oil are two distinct types of edible vegetable oils with
  different characteristics, uses, and nutritional profiles. Chili oil is made from
  chili peppers and is typically used as a condiment or flavor enhancer, while Extra
  Virgin Olive Oil is made from olives and is often used in cooking and salad dressings.
  Although they are both types of edible vegetable oils, they have unique properties
  and should not be considered duplicates.
