text: ' "Drinking Water" is the most adequate class for water when compared to "Alcoholic
  Drink", "Coffee", "Energy Drink", "Juice", "Milk", and "Tea". This is because drinking
  water contains pure H2O without any additives, whereas other beverages may contain
  sugars, caffeine, alcohol, or artificial flavors. Consuming enough water daily is
  essential for maintaining proper hydration levels in the body and supporting various
  bodily functions such as temperature regulation, digestion, nutrient absorption,
  and waste elimination.'
