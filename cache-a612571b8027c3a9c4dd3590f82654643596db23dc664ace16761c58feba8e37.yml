  The term "lobster" generally refers to the whole crustacean, including the shell,
  legs, and body, while "lobster meat" specifically refers to the edible flesh of
  the lobster. While they are related, they are not exact synonyms and could potentially
  have different uses in different contexts. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
