text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from poultry,
  quail stock and chicken/vegetable stock are different types of stock. Quail stock
  specifically uses quail bones and meat, while chicken/vegetable stock can use chicken
  bones and meat combined with vegetables, resulting in a distinct flavor profile
  for each. They should be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
