  As a dietitian, I can explain that Buckwheat honey and Clover honey are different
  types of honey with distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. They have
  different flavors, textures, and colors due to the difference in the source of nectar
  collected by the bees. Buckwheat honey is darker and has a stronger, more robust
  flavor compared to Clover honey which is lighter and milder. Additionally, they
  may contain different amounts and types of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
