text: ' No. Apple seeds and watermelon seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they are both types of seeds, they come from different fruits (apples and
  watermelons) and have different nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is important
  to keep them separate when discussing edible seeds.'
