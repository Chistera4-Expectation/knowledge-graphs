text: No, 'Electrolyte Water' and 'Glacier Water' should not be merged as they are
  not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Electrolyte water is specifically designed
  to contain electrolytes, while glacier water is sourced from glaciers and may or
  may not contain electrolytes. They serve different purposes and have distinct properties.
