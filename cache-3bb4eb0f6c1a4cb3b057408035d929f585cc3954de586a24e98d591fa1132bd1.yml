text: ' No. While both pieces of information are related to the nutritional content
  of cheese servings, they represent distinct concepts and should not be merged as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Carbohydrates per serving refers specifically
  to the amount of carbohydrate present in each serving of cheese, whereas serving
  size of the cheese is concerned with the volume or weight of the food portion being
  measured. Maintaining separate attributes for these two concepts allows for clearer
  communication about the nutritional value and physical dimensions of different cheeses.'
