text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct characteristics. French
  Yogurt typically refers to a specific style of yogurt with a thicker texture and
  often made with whole milk, while Fruit-Flavored Yogurt refers to yogurt with added
  fruit or fruit flavors, which can apply to various types of yogurt. Merging them
  would not accurately represent these differences.
