text: No, Parmesan cheese and Swiss cheese should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of cheese, they have distinct characteristics,
  flavors, and production methods, making them unique entities. Merging them would
  obscure these differences and potentially lead to confusion or misinformation.
