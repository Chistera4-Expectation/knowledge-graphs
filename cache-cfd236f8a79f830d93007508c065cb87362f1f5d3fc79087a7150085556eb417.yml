text: ' No. Curry leaves and fresh basil leaves are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both belong to the category of "leaves" and can be used in cooking.
  They come from different plants (Murraya koenigii for curry leaves and Ocimum basilicum
  for basil), have distinct flavors, appearances, and nutritional profiles. Therefore,
  it is important to maintain them as separate entities within the Edible Vegetable
  class.'
