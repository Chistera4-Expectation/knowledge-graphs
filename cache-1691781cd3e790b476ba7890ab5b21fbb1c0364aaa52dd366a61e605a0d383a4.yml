  Grape seeds and poppy seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates, as they
  come from different plant sources (grapes vs. poppies) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles, uses, and properties. They can coexist in the same category of "edible
  seeds" without causing confusion or redundancy because they represent unique items
  with their own characteristics.'
