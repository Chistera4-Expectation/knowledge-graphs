  While Creamy Garlic Dressing and Russian Dressing may have some similarities (e.g.,
  creamy texture), they are not semantic and ontological duplicates. They differ in
  their ingredients: Creamy Garlic Dressing typically includes garlic, sour cream,
  or mayo, while Russian Dressing is made with mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, and spices.
  Merging them would disregard these differences and potentially lead to confusion
  for users seeking specific dressings based on ingredient preferences.'
