  While chili oil is made using vegetable oil as a base ingredient, it contains additional
  components such as crushed red chillies or chili flakes that give it a unique flavor,
  color, and spicy taste. These distinct characteristics of chili oil set it apart
  from generic vegetable oils like canola, soybean, or corn oil, making them non-duplicative
  both semantically and ontologically.'
