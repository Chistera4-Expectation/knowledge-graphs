text: No, the instances 'Fish fillet' and 'Monkfish' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are edible fish, they represent
  different types of fish. 'Fish fillet' refers to a cut of fish, typically with the
  bones and skin removed, while 'Monkfish' is a specific type of fish (also known
  as anglerfish). Merging these two instances would not accurately represent the distinct
  nature of each in an ontology or semantic system.
