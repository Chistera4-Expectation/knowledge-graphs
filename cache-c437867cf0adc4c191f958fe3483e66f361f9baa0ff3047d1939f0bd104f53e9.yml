text: No, 'Tomato juice' and 'Vegetable Juice' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although tomatoes are technically a fruit, they are often
  considered vegetables in culinary contexts. 'Tomato juice' is specifically made
  from tomatoes, while 'Vegetable Juice' can be a blend of various vegetables, which
  may or may not include tomatoes. Therefore, they are distinct types of juice.
