text: ' No. Alfalfa honey and strawberry honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they may both fall under the category of "honey," they have distinct characteristics
  that differentiate them from one another. Alfalfa honey is made primarily from the
  nectar of alfalfa flowers, while strawberry honey is made from the nectar of strawberries
  (although it is more commonly made from clover or other flowering plants). These
  differences in origin result in variations in taste, color, and nutritional content
  between the two types of honey. Therefore, they should not be merged as duplicates
  in a classification system for honey varieties.'
