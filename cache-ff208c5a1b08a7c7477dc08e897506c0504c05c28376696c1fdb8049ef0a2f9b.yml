text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are seeds, 'Grape Seeds' refers
  specifically to the seeds found in grapes, while 'Seeds' is a more general term
  that encompasses a wide variety of seeds. Merging them would lose the specificity
  of 'Grape Seeds' and potentially create confusion.
