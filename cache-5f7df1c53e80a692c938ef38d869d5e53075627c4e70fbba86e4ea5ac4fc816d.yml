text: No, Green onions and Onions should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of onions, they are distinct in terms of
  their culinary usage and appearance. Green onions have a milder flavor, are harvested
  when they are young, and have a bulb and green leaves, while onions are harvested
  when mature and have a stronger flavor. They serve different purposes in cooking
  and recipes, so it is essential to distinguish them in a dietician's Edible Vegetable
  class.
