text: No, Turkey Sausage and Turkey Soup should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both derived from poultry (turkey),
  they are distinct food items with different preparation methods, nutritional profiles,
  and culinary uses. Merging them as duplicates would not accurately represent the
  diverse range of poultry-derived foods.
