text: No, Black Tea and Ceylon Tea should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Black Tea is a type of tea produced from the Camellia sinensis plant,
  which includes several varieties such as Ceylon Tea. Ceylon Tea is a specific type
  of Black Tea grown in Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon). Although they share
  the common characteristic of being Black Tea, they are not the same thing and should
  not be merged as duplicates.
