text: No, Hemp Milk and Nut Milk should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they both fall under the broader category of plant-based milk
  alternatives, they are derived from different sources (hemp seeds and various nuts,
  respectively) and may have different nutritional profiles and uses in recipes.
