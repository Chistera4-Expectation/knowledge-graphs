text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of tea, they have
  distinct flavor profiles and characteristics. Assam tea is a black tea from the
  Assam region in India, known for its strong, malty flavor. Earl Grey tea, on the
  other hand, is a black tea flavored with oil from the rind of bergamot orange, giving
  it a distinct citrusy flavor. These differences in flavor and origin make them separate
  and distinct types of tea.
