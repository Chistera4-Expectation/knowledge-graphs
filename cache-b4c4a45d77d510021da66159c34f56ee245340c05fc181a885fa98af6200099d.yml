text: ' No. Shaoxing wine and white wine are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While both are types of alcoholic drinks, they
  come from different regions, have distinct tastes, uses, and production processes.
  Shaoxing wine is a traditional Chinese rice wine with a rich, savory flavor commonly
  used in cooking, while white wine is made from fermented grapes and comes in various
  styles such as Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, etc., often consumed chilled as a beverage
  or used for drinking alongside food.'
