  Hen of the Woods and Portobello mushrooms are two different species of edible mushrooms
  with distinct characteristics, flavors, and culinary uses. Hen of the Woods, also
  known as Maitake, is a type of polypore mushroom, while Portobello is a mature version
  of the commonly known Agaricus bisporus, which also includes button and cremini
  mushrooms. Merging these two would not accurately represent the differences between
  them.
