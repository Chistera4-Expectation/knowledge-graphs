  While both "Herbal tea" and "Matcha green tea powder" are types of tea, they have
  different ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. Herbal teas
  are made from herbs, fruits, flowers, or other plant materials, while matcha is
  made from ground tea leaves. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
