text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although they are both types of yogurt, they have distinct properties and uses.
  Drinkable yogurt is typically a liquid or smoothie-like yogurt, while frozen yogurt
  is a frozen dessert. Each has its own nutritional profile, preparation methods,
  and consumption habits, making them distinct categories within the broader yogurt
  class.
