text: ' No. Although both "rice" and "wild rice" are types of grains, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and growth habits. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. It would be more accurate
  to consider them separate but related concepts within the same domain.'
