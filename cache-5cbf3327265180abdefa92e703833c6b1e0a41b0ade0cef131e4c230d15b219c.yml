text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties, flavors, and uses. Extra
  Virgin Olive Oil is derived from olives and is commonly used in Mediterranean cuisine,
  while Wheat Germ Oil is extracted from wheat germ and is often used for its nutritional
  benefits, such as high levels of vitamin E. Merging them would obscure these important
  differences.
