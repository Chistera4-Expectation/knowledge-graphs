  While both "Browned butter" and "Salted butter" are types of butter, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their flavor profiles and uses in cooking. Browned butter
  has a rich, nutty flavor and is often used as a finishing sauce or in baked goods,
  while salted butter is seasoned with salt and is commonly used for general cooking
  and spreading on bread. They are not interchangeable and can''t be considered duplicates.'
