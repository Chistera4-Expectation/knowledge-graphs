text: ' No, eggplants and fresh cilantro leaves are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They belong to different vegetable categories (i.e., solanaceous fruits and leafy
  herbs) with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Merging them would
  lead to incorrect information about these foods.'
