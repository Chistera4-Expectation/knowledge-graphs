  In this context, "Juice" is likely a general category of drinks made by extracting
  juice from fruits and vegetables, while "tomato juice" is a specific type of juice
  that falls under the broader category of "Juice." Therefore, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates, but rather related concepts with different levels of
  abstraction.'
