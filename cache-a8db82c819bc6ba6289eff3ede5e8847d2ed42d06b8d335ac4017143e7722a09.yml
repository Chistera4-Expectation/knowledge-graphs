text: No, Macadamia Milk and Rice Milk should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they are both types of plant-based milk, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, ingredients, and flavors. Merging them would obscure
  these differences and be misleading for users seeking specific information about
  each type of milk.
