  Justification for merging:


  * Both ''flavor\_notes'' instance variable and its description are semantically
  equivalent, referring to an array or list of flavor notes related to the coffee
  object.

  * Merging them would reduce redundancy and improve clarity by having one clear definition.

  * It aligns with best practices for code readability and maintainability.'
