text: ' No. Calcium content per serving and Protein per serving are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates, even though they both provide information about nutritional
  value of cheese servings. They represent different types of essential nutrients
  that serve distinct purposes for human health, so it is important to keep them separate
  when discussing cheese or any other food product.'
