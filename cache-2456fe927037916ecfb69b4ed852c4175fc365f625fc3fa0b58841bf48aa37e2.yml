text: No, they should not be merged. Oyster mushrooms and Reishi mushrooms are distinct
  species with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Oyster mushrooms
  are commonly eaten and have a mild flavor, while Reishi mushrooms are primarily
  used for medicinal purposes and are not typically consumed as food. Merging them
  would result in a loss of specific information about each mushroom.
