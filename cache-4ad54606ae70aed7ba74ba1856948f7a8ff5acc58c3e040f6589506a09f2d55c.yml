  While both Blueberry Honey and Cherry Blossom Honey are types of honey, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different characteristics
  and come from different sources. Blueberry Honey is made by bees that collect nectar
  from blueberry flowers, while Cherry Blossom Honey is made by bees that collect
  nectar from cherry blossoms. These two honeys may differ in taste, color, aroma,
  and other properties due to their distinct botanical origins. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
