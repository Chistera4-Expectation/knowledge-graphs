  The instances "Chicken broth" and "chicken sausages" are not identical in terms
  of their composition, preparation method, and nutritional content. Chicken broth
  is a liquid made by simmering chicken bones and meat, while chicken sausages are
  a processed food product made from ground chicken meat mixed with various ingredients
  like seasonings, fillers, and preservatives. They belong to different categories
  of food items and have distinct characteristics that set them apart. Therefore,
  they should not be considered semantic and ontological duplicates.'
