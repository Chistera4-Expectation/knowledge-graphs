text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both "Duck Thighs" and "Duck Wings" are derived from ducks and are classified
  as poultry, they are distinct cuts of meat with different nutritional profiles,
  textures, and cooking methods. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.
