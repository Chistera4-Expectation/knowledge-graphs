  While both infused water and plain water are types of drinks that can help with
  hydration, they have distinct differences from a nutritional perspective. Infused
  water typically contains additional ingredients like fruits, vegetables, herbs,
  or spices, which may provide added health benefits beyond simple hydration. These
  extra components might contribute vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, or other compounds
  depending on what is used for infusion. Therefore, treating ''Infused water'' and
  ''Water'' as semantic and ontological duplicates would not accurately reflect their
  unique properties and potential health impacts.'
