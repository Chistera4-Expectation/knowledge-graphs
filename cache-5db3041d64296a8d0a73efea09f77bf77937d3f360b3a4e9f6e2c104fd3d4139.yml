text: No, Eucalyptus Honey and Sage Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have distinct flavors, properties,
  and nutritional profiles due to the different plants their bees collect nectar from.
  Merging them would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
