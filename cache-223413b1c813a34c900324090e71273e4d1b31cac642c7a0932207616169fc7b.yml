text: As a dietician, my answer is no. While both 'Ostrich Stock' and 'Ostrich' are
  related to poultry-derived food, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  'Ostrich Stock' refers to a liquid made by boiling ostrich meat and bones, while
  'Ostrich' refers to the meat itself. They have different culinary applications and
  nutritional properties.
