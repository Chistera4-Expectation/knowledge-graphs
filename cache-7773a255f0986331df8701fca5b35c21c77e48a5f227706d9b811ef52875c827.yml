text: No, "Goat meat" and "Ostrich meat" should not be merged together as they are
  not poultry-derived foods. Poultry refers to domesticated birds, such as chickens,
  turkeys, and ducks, which are typically used for meat and eggs. Goat meat is derived
  from goats, which are mammals, and ostrich meat is derived from ostriches, which
  are flightless birds but not classified as poultry.
