text: No, Brown Rice and Sushi Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have different
  properties and uses. Brown Rice is a whole grain rice with a nutty flavor and chewy
  texture, while Sushi Rice is a short-grain rice that is sticky when cooked, making
  it ideal for sushi rolls and other Japanese dishes.
