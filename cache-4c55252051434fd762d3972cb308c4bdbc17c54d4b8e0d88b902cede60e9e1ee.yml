text: As a dietician, my answer is no. While both "A2 Butter" and "Plant-based Butter"
  may share some similarities, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. "A2
  Butter" refers to a type of butter derived from cows that primarily produce the
  A2 protein in their milk, while "Plant-based Butter" is a vegan alternative made
  from plant-based ingredients such as oils and starches. These two products have
  different nutritional profiles and are not interchangeable.
