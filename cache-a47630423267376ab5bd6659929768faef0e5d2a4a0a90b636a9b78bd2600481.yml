text: ' No. Fenugreek seeds (Trigonella foenum-graecum) and pomegranate seeds (Punica
  granatum) are distinct types of edible seeds that come from different plants with
  unique nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and health benefits. Therefore, they
  should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Here is some information
  on each:


  1. Fenugreek seeds: These seeds have a strong maple syrup aroma due to their content
  of sotolone. They contain protein, fiber, B vitamins, iron, magnesium, manganese,
  and various polyphenols. Fenugreek seeds can be used whole or ground into powder
  for cooking purposes. In addition, fenugreek has been traditionally used in herbal
  medicine to treat digestive issues, reduce inflammation, lower cholesterol levels,
  and balance blood sugar. However, more scientific evidence is needed to support
  these claims fully.

  2. Pomegranate seeds: Also known as arils, these tiny ruby-red gems enclosed within
  the leathery skin of pomegranates are packed with antioxidants, including anthocyanins,
  tannins, and ellagitannins. Rich in fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K, and potassium,
  pomegranate seeds offer numerous health benefits such as reducing oxidative stress,
  supporting heart health, preventing certain cancers, improving memory, and alleviating
  symptoms associated with inflammatory conditions like arthritis. Moreover, the juice
  obtained from crushing these seeds provides additional health advantages.


  As you can see, both fenugreek seeds and pomegranate seeds possess distinctive characteristics
  justifying their separate classification.'
