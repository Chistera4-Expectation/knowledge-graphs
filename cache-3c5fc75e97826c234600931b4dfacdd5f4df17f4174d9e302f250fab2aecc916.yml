text: ' Infusion Drink. Electrolytes can be found in various types of beverages, but
  infusion drinks are specifically formulated to contain optimal amounts of electrolytes
  and fluids for hydration purposes. Coffee and tea contain some electrolytes but
  not in the same concentrated amount as an infusion drink intended for rehydration.'
