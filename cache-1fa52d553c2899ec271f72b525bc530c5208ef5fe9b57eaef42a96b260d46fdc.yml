text: No, Forbidden Rice and Wild Rice should not be merged together as they are different
  types of rice with distinct characteristics. Forbidden Rice, also known as Black
  Rice, is a whole grain rice with a deep purple-black color and is rich in antioxidants.
  Wild Rice, on the other hand, is not actually rice but a separate species of grass
  native to North America and is often darker and chewier than traditional rice varieties.
  While they may share some similarities, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
