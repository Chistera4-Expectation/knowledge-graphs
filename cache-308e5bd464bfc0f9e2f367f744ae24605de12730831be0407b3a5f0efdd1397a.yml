  While both grain-finished beef and pasture-raised beef refer to types of beef, they
  differ significantly in terms of how the animals are raised and fed, which can have
  an impact on their nutritional content and environmental footprint. Grain-finished
  beef comes from cattle that are finished on a diet primarily composed of grains
  like corn and soybeans, while pasture-raised beef comes from cattle that are raised
  on open pastures and eat a diet mainly consisting of grasses. As such, these two
  concepts should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
