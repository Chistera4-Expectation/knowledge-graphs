  The two instances, "Sunflower seeds" and "Chia seeds for added crunch," are not
  identical in their entirety. Although they share some similarities, such as being
  edible seeds, they have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Sunflower
  seeds are typically consumed as a snack or used as an ingredient in dishes like
  salads, while chia seeds are often used as a thickening agent or added to foods
  for extra texture and nutrition. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate
  rather than merging them as duplicates.'
