text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Pickled
  vegetables and vegetable broth have different characteristics and uses in a diet.
  Pickled vegetables are vegetables that have been preserved in vinegar, brine, or
  other solutions, while vegetable broth is a liquid made by simmering vegetables
  in water, often used as a base for soups and sauces. They both have their own unique
  nutritional profiles and should be treated as separate entities within the Edible
  Vegetable class.
