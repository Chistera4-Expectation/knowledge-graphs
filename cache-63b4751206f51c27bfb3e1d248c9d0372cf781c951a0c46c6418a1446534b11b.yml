text: No, Basmati Rice and Sticky Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have distinct characteristics
  and uses, and therefore should be kept separate in a classification system. Basmati
  Rice is a long-grain rice known for its aroma and fluffy texture, while Sticky Rice
  is a short-grain variety that is stickier and often used in dishes like sushi or
  desserts.
