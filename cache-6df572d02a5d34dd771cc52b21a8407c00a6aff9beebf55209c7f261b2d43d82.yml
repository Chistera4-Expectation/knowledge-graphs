text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  they belong to the same Edible Crustaceans class, Rock Crab and Snow Crab are distinct
  species with different characteristics, habitats, and nutritional profiles. Merging
  them would not accurately represent their unique properties.
