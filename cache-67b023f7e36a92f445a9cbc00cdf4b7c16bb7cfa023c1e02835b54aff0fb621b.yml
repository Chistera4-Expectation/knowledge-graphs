text: ' No. Shaoxing wine and Wine are not semantic and ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged together. While both are types of alcoholic drinks, they come
  from different sources and have distinct flavors, uses, and cultural significance.
  Shaoxing wine is a type of Chinese rice wine that has been fermented for several
  months to produce its unique taste, while Wine generally refers to an alcoholic
  drink made from fermented grapes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two instances together as they represent separate concepts within the category
  of alcoholic drinks.'
