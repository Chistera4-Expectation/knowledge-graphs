  The two instances, "Roasted red bell peppers, diced" and "diced tomatoes," are not
  identical in their preparation method (roasting vs. fresh) and nutritional content
  (bell peppers have more fiber and vitamin C than tomatoes), so they should not be
  merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
