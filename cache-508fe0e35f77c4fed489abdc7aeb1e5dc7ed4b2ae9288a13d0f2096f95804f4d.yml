text: Yes, in a strict ontological sense, 'Apple' and 'Apples' should be considered
  as duplicates since they refer to the same fruit, just in singular and plural form
  respectively. However, in a practical sense, they may be treated as separate instances
  to accommodate for variations in data storage and processing.
