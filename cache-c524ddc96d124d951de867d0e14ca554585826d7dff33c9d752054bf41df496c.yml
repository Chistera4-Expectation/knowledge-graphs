  While flaxseed oil and walnut oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Here are some
  key differences between the two:


  * Flaxseed oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids, specifically alpha-linolenic acid
  (ALA), while walnut oil contains a more balanced ratio of omega-3, -6, and -9 fatty
  acids.

  * Flaxseed oil has a lower smoke point than walnut oil, making it less suitable
  for high-heat cooking methods like frying.

  * Walnut oil has a rich, nutty flavor that makes it ideal for salad dressings, drizzling
  over vegetables, or using in baking and desserts, whereas flaxseed oil may be better
  suited for smoothies, dips, and sauces where its delicate taste won''t be overwhelmed
  by other ingredients.


  So, despite their shared classification as edible vegetable oils, flaxseed oil and
  walnut oil serve different culinary and health purposes, warranting separate treatment
  rather than merging as duplicates.'
