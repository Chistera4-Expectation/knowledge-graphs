text: 'No, the instances ''Hard-boiled eggs'' and ''Pickled vegetables'' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible,
  they belong to different food categories: hard-boiled eggs are a type of cooked
  egg, while pickled vegetables are a type of preserved vegetable. They have different
  nutritional profiles and preparation methods.'
