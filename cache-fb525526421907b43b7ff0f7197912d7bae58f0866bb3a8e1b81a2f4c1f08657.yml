text: No, 'Beef Balls' and 'Beef Shank' should not be merged as they are two distinct
  cuts of beef with different culinary uses and nutritional properties. While they
  both come from cattle, they are different parts of the animal and therefore cannot
  be considered semantic or ontologic duplicates.
