text: No, the instances 'Blue Cheese' and 'crumbled feta cheese' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of cheese,
  they have distinct characteristics and properties that differentiate them from one
  another. Blue Cheese is typically a mold-ripened cheese, while feta cheese is a
  brined curd cheese. They also differ in taste, texture, and appearance.
