  Although "Italian Dressing" and "Poppy Seed Dressing" might seem similar because
  they are both types of salad dressings, they have distinct ingredients and flavors.
  Italian dressing typically includes olive oil, vinegar, garlic, and various herbs,
  while Poppy Seed Dressing is made with poppy seeds, sugar, onion, vegetable oil,
  and vinegar. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.'
