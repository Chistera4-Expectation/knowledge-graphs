text: No, Quail Broth and Quail Tenders should not be merged as they are different
  types of poultry-derived food items. Quail Broth is a liquid derived from cooking
  quail, while Quail Tenders are a specific cut of quail meat. They have different
  nutritional profiles and uses in recipes, so they should be treated as distinct
  entities in a Poultry-derived Food class.
