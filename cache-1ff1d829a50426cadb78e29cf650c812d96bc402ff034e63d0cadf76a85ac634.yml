text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles.
  Creamy Yogurt typically has a higher fat content, a smoother texture, and a milder
  taste, while Skyr Yogurt is traditionally Icelandic, has a thicker consistency,
  is strained to remove excess liquid, and is typically lower in fat but higher in
  protein. Merging them as duplicates would disregard these important differences.
