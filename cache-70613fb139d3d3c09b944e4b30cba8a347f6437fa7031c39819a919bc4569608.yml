text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both 'Quail Patties' and 'Quail Sausage' are derived from quail meat, they are different
  food products with distinct shapes, textures, and possibly ingredients or preparation
  methods. Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived
  food options available.
