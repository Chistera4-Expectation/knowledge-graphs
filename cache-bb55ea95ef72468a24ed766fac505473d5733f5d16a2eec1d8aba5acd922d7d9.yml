text: ' No. While fresh fish and raw fish may seem similar, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Fresh fish refers to any fish that has been recently
  caught and has not begun to decay, whereas raw fish specifically refers to fish
  that is intended to be consumed uncooked, often as sushi or ceviche. Therefore,
  not all fresh fish is considered raw fish, and not all raw fish is necessarily fresh.'
