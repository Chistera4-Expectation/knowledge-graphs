text: No, the instances 'Mitten Crab' and 'Sand Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible crustaceans, they
  belong to different families and have distinct characteristics. Mitten Crab (Eriocheir
  sinensis) is a freshwater crab with a unique fur-like appearance on its claws, while
  Sand Crab (Emerita analoga) is a small, burrowing crustacean found along sandy beaches.
  Merging them would create confusion and misrepresent their unique features.
