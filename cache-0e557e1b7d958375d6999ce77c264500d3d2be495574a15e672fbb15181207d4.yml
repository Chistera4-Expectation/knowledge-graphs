text: No, Argan Oil and Walnut Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetal oils, they have different properties,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Argan Oil is rich in vitamin E and essential fatty
  acids, while Walnut Oil is high in polyunsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids.
  They also have distinct flavors and are used in different culinary contexts.
