text: ' No. Short-grain rice and wild rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. Although they share the common property of being
  types of rice, they have distinct characteristics and uses that make them unique
  from each other. Short-grain rice is typically rounder and stickier than long-grain
  rice varieties, while wild rice has a more elongated shape and a nutty flavor. Additionally,
  short-grain rice is often used in dishes like sushi and risotto, whereas wild rice
  is commonly used as a side dish or added to soups and salads for texture and flavor.
  Therefore, it is important to maintain their separate identities within the rice
  class.'
