text: ' Dairy Product (with a focus on dairy products that have high fat content,
  such as cream) would be an appropriate class name. However, if you specifically
  want to highlight the high-fat nature of cream compared to other dairy products,
  you could also consider "High-Fat Dairy" or simply "Cream" as class names.'
