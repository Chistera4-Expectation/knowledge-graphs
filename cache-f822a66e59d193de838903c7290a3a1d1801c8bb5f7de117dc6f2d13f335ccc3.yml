text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of beef, they have
  distinct differences in terms of preparation, flavor, and culinary uses. Beef shank
  is a cut of beef from the lower leg and is often used in slow-cooked dishes like
  stews, whereas corned beef is beef cured or pickled in a seasoned brine, resulting
  in a different flavor profile and texture.
