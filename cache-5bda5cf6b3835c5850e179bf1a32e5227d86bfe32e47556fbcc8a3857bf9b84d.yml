text: ' No. Scotch bonnet peppers and white pepper powder are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They belong to different categories of food items: one is a type of
  chili pepper (a fresh or dried fruit), while the other is a ground spice made from
  the seed of another variety of pepper plant (black pepper). Therefore, they have
  distinct properties, uses, and nutritional profiles, making them non-duplicative
  within the context of a dietary classification system like the "Spice" class you
  mentioned.'
