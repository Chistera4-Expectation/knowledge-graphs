text: No, Flax Seeds and Papaya Seeds should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both are edible seeds, they are from different plants
  and have different nutritional properties and uses. Therefore, they should be kept
  as separate instances within the Edible Seeds class.
