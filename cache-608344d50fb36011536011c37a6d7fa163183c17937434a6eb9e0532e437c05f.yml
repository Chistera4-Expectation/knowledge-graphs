  While both Greek yogurt dressing and thousand island dressing are types of salad
  dressings, they have different ingredients and flavors. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. Greek yogurt
  dressing is typically made with Greek yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs,
  while thousand island dressing is made with mayonnaise, ketchup, sweet pickle relish,
  and other seasonings. Merging these two concepts would result in a loss of important
  distinctions between them.'
