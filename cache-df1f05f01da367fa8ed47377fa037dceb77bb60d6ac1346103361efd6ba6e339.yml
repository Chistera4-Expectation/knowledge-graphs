text: ' No. While both Russian Dressing and Teriyaki Dressing are types of salad dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients and flavors. Russian Dressing is typically made with
  ketchup, mayonnaise, wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and chili sauce, among
  other ingredients. Teriyaki Dressing, on the other hand, is made with soy sauce,
  rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, and ginger, among other ingredients. Therefore, they
  cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
