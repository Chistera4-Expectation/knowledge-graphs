text: No, they should not be merged. Although both "Fish" and "Flying fish" are in
  the Edible Fish class, they are distinct entities with different characteristics
  and properties. "Flying fish" is a specific type of fish with the ability to glide
  above the water surface, while "Fish" is a general term for the entire class of
  aquatic vertebrates with gills. Maintaining these distinct entities in the ontology
  allows for accurate representation and classification of these types of fish.
