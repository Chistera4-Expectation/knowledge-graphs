text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Ostrich Meat" and "Ostrich
  Nuggets" are derived from the same source (ostrich), they are different food products.
  "Ostrich Meat" refers to the general category of meat from ostriches, while "Ostrich
  Nuggets" are a specific type of processed ostrich meat product, typically in bite-sized
  pieces. They have distinct culinary uses and nutritional profiles, so they should
  be treated as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
