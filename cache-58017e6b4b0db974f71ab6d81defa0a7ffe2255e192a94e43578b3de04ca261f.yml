text: No, Duck Broth and Duck Meatballs should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from ducks, they are distinct
  food items with different properties and uses in recipes. Duck Broth is a liquid
  made by simmering duck bones and/or meat, while Duck Meatballs are a solid food
  made from ground duck meat, typically combined with other ingredients like breadcrumbs
  and seasonings.
