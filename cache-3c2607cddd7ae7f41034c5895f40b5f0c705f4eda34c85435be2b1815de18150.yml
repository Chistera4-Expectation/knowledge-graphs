  While both Creamy Garlic Dressing and Thousand Island Dressing may share some similarities
  (e.g., they are both creamy), they have distinct ingredients that set them apart
  from one another. Creamy Garlic Dressing typically consists of garlic, oil, vinegar,
  and various seasonings, while Thousand Island Dressing includes ingredients such
  as tomato sauce, mayonnaise, hard-boiled eggs, onions, and sweet pickles. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates
  since they represent different food items with unique characteristics and uses.'
