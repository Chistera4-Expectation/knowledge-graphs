text: ' No. While brown sugar and dark brown sugar are similar and often used interchangeably
  in recipes, they have distinct differences in terms of their color, flavor, and
  moisture content due to varying degrees of molasses present during manufacturing.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates
  from a dietary perspective.'
