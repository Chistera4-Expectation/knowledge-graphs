text: No, Quail Patties and Quail Stock should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are different food items derived from quail. Quail Patties are
  a form of processed food, typically made from ground quail meat, while Quail Stock
  is a liquid made by simmering quail bones and other ingredients to extract flavors
  and nutrients. Although they are related, they serve different purposes and have
  distinct properties.
