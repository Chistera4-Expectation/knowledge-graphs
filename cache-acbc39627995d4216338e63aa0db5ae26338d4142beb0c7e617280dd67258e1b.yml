  duplicates.


  Although they share a similar base ingredient, which is guinea fowl, broth and stock
  have distinct differences. Broth is typically made by simmering meat, vegetables,
  and aromatics in water, and is often seasoned with salt and herbs. The resulting
  liquid is thin and flavorful, and it can be used as a base for soups, sauces, or
  consumed on its own.


  On the other hand, stock is made by simmering bones, meat, and sometimes vegetables
  in water for a longer period of time. The goal is to extract the gelatin from the
  bones, which gives the stock a thicker consistency and a richer, more concentrated
  flavor. Stock is commonly used as a base for soups, stews, and sauces, and it can
  also be used for deglazing pans or making risotto.


  While the two might be used interchangeably in some recipes, they are not the same
  and should not be merged as duplicates.'
