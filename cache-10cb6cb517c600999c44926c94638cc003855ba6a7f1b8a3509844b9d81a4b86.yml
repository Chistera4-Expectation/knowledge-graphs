text: No, they should not be merged. While both are types of butter, they have distinct
  differences in their composition and usage. Clarified butter is made by melting
  butter and separating the milk solids and water, resulting in a high smoke point
  and longer shelf life. Spreadable butter, on the other hand, is typically made by
  blending regular butter with a liquid, such as oil, to make it softer and easier
  to spread. These differences in production and properties make them distinct types
  of butter.
