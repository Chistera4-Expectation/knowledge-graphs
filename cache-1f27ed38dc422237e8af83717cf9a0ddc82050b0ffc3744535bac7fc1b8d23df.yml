text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics and uses. Steamed white
  rice is a common variety of rice that is typically prepared by boiling or steaming,
  and it is used as a side dish or a base for many dishes. Sticky rice, on the other
  hand, is a type of glutinous rice that has a higher starch content, which makes
  it sticky when cooked. It is often used in dishes like sushi or as a dessert. Therefore,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates and should be treated as separate
  entities.
