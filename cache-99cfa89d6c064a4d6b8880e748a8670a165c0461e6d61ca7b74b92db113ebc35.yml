text: No, Turkey Breast and Turkey Gravy should not be merged as they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional profiles. Turkey Breast is a lean protein
  source, while Turkey Gravy is typically higher in fat and calories due to added
  ingredients. They may be related in the sense that they both come from turkey, but
  they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
