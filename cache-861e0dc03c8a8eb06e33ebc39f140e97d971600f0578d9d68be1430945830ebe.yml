text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and
  uses. Enchilada sauce typically consists of tomatoes, chili peppers, and various
  spices, while Sriracha sauce is made from chili peppers, vinegar, garlic, and sugar.
  Although both are sauces, they serve different purposes in cooking and have distinct
  flavor profiles.
