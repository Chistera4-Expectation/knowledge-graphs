  Although black rice and wild rice have similar names and both are nutritious types
  of whole grain rice, they belong to different species and have distinct characteristics.
  Black rice (Oryza sativa L.) is also known as forbidden rice and has a deep purple-black
  color due to its high anthocyanin content. Wild rice (Zizania spp.), on the other
  hand, actually refers to several species of grasses that produce long, slender grains
  with a chewy texture and nutty flavor. They differ in their taste, appearance, cultivation
  methods, and cultural significance. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
