text: No, Bell pepper and Dill pickles should not be merged as they are distinct edible
  vegetables with different characteristics, nutritional profiles, and preparation
  methods. Bell pepper is a fruit (from the plant species Capsicum annuum) that is
  often consumed as a vegetable, while Dill pickles are cucumbers preserved in a brine
  or vinegar solution with dill, garlic, and other seasonings.
