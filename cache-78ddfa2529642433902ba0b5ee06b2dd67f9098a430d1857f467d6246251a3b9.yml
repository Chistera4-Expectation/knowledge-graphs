text: No, "Turkey Patties" and "Turkey Tenders" should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they both involve turkey meat, they are different
  food products with distinct shapes and cooking methods. Turkey patties are typically
  flat and round, often used for burgers or sandwiches, while turkey tenders are long,
  thin strips of meat, often used for stir-fries or as a snack.
