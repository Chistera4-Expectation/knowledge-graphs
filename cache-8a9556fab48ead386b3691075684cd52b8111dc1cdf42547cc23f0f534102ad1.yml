text: No, the instances 'Sand Crab' and 'Spider Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are crustaceans, they belong
  to different families and have distinct characteristics and habitats. Sand Crabs
  (Molinidae) are small marine crustaceans that live in sandy beaches, while Spider
  Crabs (Majidae) are larger crustaceans that have a unique exoskeleton and are often
  found in rocky areas or seagrass beds.
