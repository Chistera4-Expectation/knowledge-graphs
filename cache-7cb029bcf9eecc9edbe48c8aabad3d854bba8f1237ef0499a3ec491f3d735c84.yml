text: ' No. While red onions and onions (which are typically yellow or white) belong
  to the same species (*Allium cepa*), they have different sensory qualities such
  as color, taste, and texture that make them unique food items with distinct uses
  in cooking. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate as individual classes.
  Merging them would not accurately reflect their differences and could lead to confusion
  when specifying recipes or nutritional information.'
