text: 'No, the instances ''Cremini Mushroom'' and ''Optional: Wood ear mushrooms''
  should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are two
  distinct types of edible mushrooms with different characteristics and uses in recipes.
  Cremini mushrooms, also known as baby bella or brown mushrooms, have a brown color
  and a rich, earthy flavor. Wood ear mushrooms, on the other hand, have a black or
  dark brown color, a crunchy texture, and are often used for their unique texture
  in dishes. Merging these instances would not accurately represent the differences
  between these two types of mushrooms.'
