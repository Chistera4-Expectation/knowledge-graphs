text: ' No. While "French bread" is a type of bread that originated in France and
  may also be referred to simply as "French," it is not appropriate to merge the two
  instances as they have different levels of specificity. "French bread" refers to
  a specific style of bread with a particular set of characteristics, while "French"
  can refer to any food item from France. Therefore, it is important to keep these
  two instances separate in order to accurately describe and categorize them.'
