text: No, the instances 'Pork Belly' and 'Pork Chop' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. While they are both derived from pork, they
  are different cuts of meat with distinct characteristics and uses in cooking. Pork
  Belly is a fatty cut often used for roasting or braising, while Pork Chop is a leaner
  cut typically grilled, pan-fried, or broiled.
