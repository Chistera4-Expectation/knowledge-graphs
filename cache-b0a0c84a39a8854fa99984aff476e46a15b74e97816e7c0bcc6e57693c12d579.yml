text: No, Chicken Gravy and Chicken Wings should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from poultry, they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional compositions and preparation methods. Chicken
  Gravy is typically a sauce made from the drippings of cooked chicken, while Chicken
  Wings are a specific cut of the chicken that is often served as a dish itself.
