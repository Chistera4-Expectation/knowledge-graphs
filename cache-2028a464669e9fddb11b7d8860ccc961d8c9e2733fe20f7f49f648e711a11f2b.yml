  Fish sauce and Teriyaki sauce are two distinct condiments with their own unique
  flavor profiles and ingredients. While they are both Asian sauces, they have different
  cultural associations, uses in cooking, and flavor profiles. Therefore, they should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
