text: ' No. While honeydew melon and watermelon are both types of fruit and share
  some similarities (such as being mostly water), they have enough differences that
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. For example, they
  differ in taste, texture, color, nutritional content, and other characteristics.
  Therefore, it is important to keep them separate when discussing or categorizing
  edible fruits.'
