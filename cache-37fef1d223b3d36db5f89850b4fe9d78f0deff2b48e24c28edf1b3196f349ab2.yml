text: No, they should not be merged. While both brown sugar and coconut sugar are
  considered sweeteners, they have different properties, chemical compositions, and
  sources. Brown sugar is a refined sugar with molasses added back, while coconut
  sugar is derived from the sap of the coconut palm. Therefore, they should be treated
  as distinct instances in the Sweetener class.
