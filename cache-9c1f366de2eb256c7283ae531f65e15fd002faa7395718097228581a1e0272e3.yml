text: No, the instances 'Eucalyptus Honey' and 'Pine Honey' should not be merged as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates because they are distinct types of honey with
  different properties and flavors, depending on the specific flowers the bees pollinate.
  They are separate classes within the Honey class.
