text: No, they should not be merged as they have different ingredients and uses. Italian
  seasoning typically consists of a blend of herbs like basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary,
  and marjoram, while seasoning cubes often contain salt, monosodium glutamate (MSG),
  and various herbs and spices, depending on the brand and type. They are distinct
  in their composition and application in cooking.
