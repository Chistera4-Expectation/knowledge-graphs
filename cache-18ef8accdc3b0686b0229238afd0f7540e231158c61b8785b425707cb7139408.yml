text: ' No. Idli rice and rice flour are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both come from rice. They have different properties and uses in
  cooking. Idli rice is typically parboiled rice that has been soaked, ground, and
  fermented to make soft and fluffy idlis (a type of steamed dumpling), while rice
  flour is made by grinding dried rice grains into a fine powder used for various
  purposes such as making bread, pastries, and thickening sauces.'
