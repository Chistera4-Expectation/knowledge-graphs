text: ' The most adequate class for "Oxtails" would be "Pork-derived Food" or more
  broadly, "Meat." However, since none of the provided classes specifically refers
  to meat (except for pork and poultry), I would suggest "Protein Source" as an appropriate
  category. Oxtails are primarily composed of bone and connective tissue but also
  contain muscle meat, making them a good source of protein.'
