text: No, "Chicken Nuggets" and "Chicken Patties" should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from poultry, they are
  different food items with distinct processing methods and shapes. Chicken nuggets
  are typically smaller, bite-sized pieces of chicken that have been breaded or battered,
  while chicken patties are larger, flattened pieces of ground chicken, often with
  additional ingredients mixed in, and are shaped more like a traditional hamburger
  patty. These differences in preparation, shape, and ingredients make them separate
  entities in the Poultry-derived Food class.
