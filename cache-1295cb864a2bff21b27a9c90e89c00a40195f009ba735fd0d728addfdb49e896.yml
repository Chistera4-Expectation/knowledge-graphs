  The terms "cooked rice" and "risotto rice" refer to different types of cooked rice
  dishes with distinct textures, flavors, and preparation methods. While they share
  some similarities, they are not interchangeable or identical, and therefore should
  not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
