text: No, Corn Oil and Sesame Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetal oils, they have distinct properties,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Corn oil has a mild flavor and is high in polyunsaturated
  fats, while sesame oil has a nutty aroma and is high in monounsaturated fats. These
  differences make them unique and not interchangeable.
