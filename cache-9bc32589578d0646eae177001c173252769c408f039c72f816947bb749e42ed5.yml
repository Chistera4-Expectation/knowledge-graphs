  \ \n\nFrom a nutritional standpoint, Focaccia and Soda bread are different, as they\
  \ have different ingredients and preparation methods, which can affect their nutritional\
  \ profiles. However, if the program in question is focused on a different aspect,\
  \ such as their names or their roles in a recipe, then merging them as duplicates\
  \ could make sense.\n\nIn summary, the decision to merge or not merge the instances\
  \ 'Focaccia Bread' and 'Soda Bread' in the Bread class depends on the specific context\
