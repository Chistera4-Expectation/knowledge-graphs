  While both Blackberry Honey and Orange Blossom Honey are types of honey, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different properties and
  sources. Blackberry Honey is made from the nectar of blackberry flowers while Orange
  Blossom Honey is made from the nectar of orange blossoms. These differences can
  affect their taste, color, aroma, and other characteristics. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
