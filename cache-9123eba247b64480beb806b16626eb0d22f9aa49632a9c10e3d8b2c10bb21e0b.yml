text: As a dietician, my answer would be no, they should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Although both are types of bread, they have
  distinct differences in their nutritional value, ingredients, and preparation methods.
  For example, pita bread is typically made from white flour and has a pocket, while
  whole wheat bread is made from whole wheat flour and has a higher fiber content.
  These differences are important to consider when providing nutritional advice and
  meal planning.
