text: ' No. While both "saturated fat per serving" and "serving size of the cheese"
  are related to nutrition and portion control, they measure different things and
  serve distinct purposes in describing a cheese product. Merging them as duplicates
  would not accurately represent their unique contributions to understanding a cheese''s
  nutritional profile.'
