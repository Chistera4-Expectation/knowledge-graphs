text: No, Almond Oil and Pumpkin Seed Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they are derived from different
  plant sources and have distinct properties, nutritional profiles, and uses. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each oil.
