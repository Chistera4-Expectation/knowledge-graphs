text: No, avocado oil and castor oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. They are two distinct types of edible vegetable oils with
  different chemical compositions, properties, and uses. While they both are derived
  from plants, their origins, extraction methods, and nutritional profiles are quite
  different. Avocado oil is extracted from the pulp of avocado fruit and is high in
  monounsaturated fats, while castor oil is derived from the seeds of the castor oil
  plant and contains high levels of ricinoleic acid.
