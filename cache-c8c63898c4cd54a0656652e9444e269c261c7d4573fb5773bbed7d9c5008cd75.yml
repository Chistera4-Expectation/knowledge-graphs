text: ' No. Ranch Dressing and Yogurt Dressing are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While both types of dressings can be used for similar purposes, they have distinct
  ingredients and nutritional properties. Ranch Dressing is typically made with buttermilk,
  mayonnaise, and various herbs and spices, while Yogurt Dressing is made primarily
  from yogurt, often with added flavors and seasonings. Therefore, they represent
  different food items with unique characteristics.'
