text: As a dietician, I would say that the instances 'Ciabatta Bread' and 'White Bread'
  should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they
  are both types of bread, they have distinct characteristics, nutritional values,
  and uses in cooking. Merging them together would not accurately represent the differences
  between the two types of bread.
