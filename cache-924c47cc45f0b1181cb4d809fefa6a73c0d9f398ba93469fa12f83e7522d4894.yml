text: As a dietician, I can provide an informed opinion on this question. From a dietary
  perspective, breadcrumbs and rye bread are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They are two distinct types of bread products with different nutritional profiles
  and uses in cooking. Therefore, they should not be merged together.
