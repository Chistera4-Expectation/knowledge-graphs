text: No, 'Turkey Breast' and 'Turkey Tenders' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both come from turkeys, they are distinct cuts
  of meat with different properties and uses in cooking. Turkey breast is a leaner,
  larger cut of meat that is typically used for roasting, while turkey tenders are
  smaller, more tender cuts that are often used for stir-fries, grilling, or breading
  and frying. Merging them together would not accurately reflect the differences between
  these two cuts of meat.
