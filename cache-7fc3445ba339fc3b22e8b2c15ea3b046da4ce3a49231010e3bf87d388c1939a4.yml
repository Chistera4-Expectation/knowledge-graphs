text: No, 'Sourwood Honey' and 'Tupelo Honey' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of honey, they come from different
  plants and have distinct flavors and properties. Sourwood honey is derived from
  the nectar of sourwood trees, while Tupelo honey comes from the nectar of tupelo
  trees. Merging them would result in a loss of important information about each type
  of honey.
