  While both "pork shoulder" and "roasted pork" are types of pork, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they refer to different cuts of meat that undergo
  different preparation methods. Pork shoulder is a specific cut from the upper part
  of the pig''s front leg, while roasted pork can refer to any type of pork cooked
  by dry heat using an oven or a rotisserie. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
