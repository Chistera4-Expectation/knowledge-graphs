text: As a dietician, I would say that while both 'Breadcrumbs' and 'Multigrain Bread'
  are types of bread, they serve different purposes and have different nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Breadcrumbs are typically used as a topping or to add texture to a dish, while multigrain
  bread is a type of bread intended to be consumed as a staple food. They should be
  treated as separate instances in the Bread class.
