text: No, 'Eucalyptus Honey' and 'Manuka Honey' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of honey, they have distinct characteristics,
  properties, and origins. Eucalyptus Honey is derived from the nectar of eucalyptus
  flowers, while Manuka Honey comes from the nectar of the Manuka tree. These differences
  lead to variations in taste, aroma, and potential health benefits, making them unique
  and separate entities within the Honey class.
