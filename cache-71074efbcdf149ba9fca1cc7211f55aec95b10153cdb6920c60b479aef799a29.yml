  The amount of protein in the juice per serving is a specific piece of information
  about the nutritional content of the juice, while "tomato juice as needed" refers
  to the ingredient used to make the juice. These two pieces of information serve
  different purposes and are not duplicative in terms of their meaning (semantics)
  or their relationship to other concepts (ontology).'
