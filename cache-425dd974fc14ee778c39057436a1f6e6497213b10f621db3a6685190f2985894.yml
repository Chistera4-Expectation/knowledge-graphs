text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. While both soy sauce and Worcestershire
  sauce are used for seasoning, they have distinct flavors and ingredients. Soy sauce
  is made from fermented soybeans, whereas Worcestershire sauce contains a mix of
  ingredients, including vinegar, molasses, and anchovies. Merging them as duplicates
  would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
