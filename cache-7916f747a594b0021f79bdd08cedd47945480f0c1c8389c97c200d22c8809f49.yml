text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics and ingredients, which makes
  them separate entities in the Yogurt class. Fruit-Flavored Yogurt contains fruit
  flavoring or pieces of fruit, while Plain Yogurt is typically unsweetened and unflavored.
