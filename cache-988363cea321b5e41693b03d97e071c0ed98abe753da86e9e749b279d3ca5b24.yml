text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different cuts of pheasant
  meat with unique characteristics and nutritional values. Pheasant tenders and pheasant
  thighs are distinct parts of the pheasant, and they can be prepared and consumed
  differently. While they share the same source (pheasant), they have distinct attributes
  that warrant separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
