text: No, "Eggs" and "Ostrich Eggs" should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are derived from poultry and are considered eggs, they
  have different nutritional profiles and properties. Ostrich eggs are significantly
  larger and have a different composition compared to chicken eggs, which warrants
  separate consideration in a dietary context.
