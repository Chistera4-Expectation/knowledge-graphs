text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Pheasant Soup" and "Pheasant"
  are poultry-derived foods, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. "Pheasant
  Soup" is a specific type of soup made from pheasant meat, while "Pheasant" refers
  to the bird itself, which can be used in various dishes, including soups. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the distinction between the two.
