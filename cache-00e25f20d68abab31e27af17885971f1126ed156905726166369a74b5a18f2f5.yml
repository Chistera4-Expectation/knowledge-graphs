text: No, the instances 'Beech Mushroom' and 'King Oyster Mushroom' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible mushrooms,
  they are different species with distinct characteristics, nutritional values, and
  culinary uses. They should be treated as separate entities in the Edible Mushrooms
  class.
