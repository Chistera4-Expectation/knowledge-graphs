text: ' No, nectarines and tangerines should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of fruit with different characteristics. Nectarines are a type of peach with
  a smooth skin, while tangerines are a type of citrus fruit that is smaller and usually
  easier to peel than other citrus fruits. They belong to different botanical families
  (Rosaceae for nectarines and Rutaceae for tangerines) and have different nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological
  duplicates.'
