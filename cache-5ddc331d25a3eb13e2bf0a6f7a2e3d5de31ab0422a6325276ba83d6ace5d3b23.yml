text: No, the instances 'Key lime juice' and 'Pineapple juice' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are distinct types of juices
  with different flavors, nutritional profiles, and origins. While they both fall
  under the broader category of juices, they are unique and should be treated as separate
  entities.
