text: No, they should not be merged together. Artisanal Water and Sparkling Water
  are different types of drinking water with distinct characteristics. Artisanal Water
  refers to water that is sourced and bottled in a specific location, often with unique
  qualities due to its natural environment, while Sparkling Water is water that contains
  dissolved carbon dioxide gas, giving it a fizzy or bubbly texture. Although both
  are types of drinking water, they have different properties and should be treated
  as separate entities in a Drinking Water class.
