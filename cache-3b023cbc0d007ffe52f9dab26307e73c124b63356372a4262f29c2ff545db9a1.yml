  While mayonnaise and spicy mayo share some similarities (both are creamy, tangy
  sauces), they have distinct differences that make them separate entities. Spicy
  mayo is essentially mayonnaise with added ingredients like hot sauce or chili peppers
  to give it a spicy kick. Therefore, merging these two instances would not accurately
  reflect their unique properties and uses.'
