  While both chicken nuggets and rotisserie chicken are poultry-derived foods, they
  serve different purposes and have unique nutritional profiles. Chicken nuggets are
  typically processed and breaded, often containing added ingredients like fillers,
  preservatives, and flavorings. Rotisserie chickens, on the other hand, are generally
  seasoned but not heavily processed and can provide a more balanced source of protein,
  vitamins, and minerals. Therefore, it is essential to maintain separate categories
  for these items when discussing poultry-derived food options.'
