text: No, Argan Oil and Olive Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although they both fall under the category of edible vegetal oils, they have distinct
  properties, origins, and uses. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique
  characteristics of each oil.
