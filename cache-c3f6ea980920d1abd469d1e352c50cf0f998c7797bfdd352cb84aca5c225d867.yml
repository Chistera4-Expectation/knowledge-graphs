text: No, 'Chicken Broth' and 'Chicken Thighs' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different food items derived from poultry,
  with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Chicken Broth is a liquid
  made by simmering chicken bones and meat in water, while Chicken Thighs are a specific
  cut of chicken meat. Although both are derived from poultry, they serve different
  purposes in cooking and have different nutritional compositions.
