text: As a dietician, I would recommend not merging 'Kefir Yogurt' and 'Lassi Yogurt'
  as they are different types of yogurt with distinct characteristics and ingredients.
  While both are fermented dairy products, Kefir is made with kefir grains, has a
  thinner consistency, and is typically higher in probiotics. Lassi, on the other
  hand, is an Indian yogurt drink that can be both sweet and savory, and it is often
  flavored with spices or fruits. Merging them as semantic and ontologic duplicates
  would not accurately represent the differences between these two types of yogurt.
