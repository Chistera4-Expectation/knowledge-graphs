text: ' "Milk" would be the most appropriate class for evaporated milk out of the
  given options. This is because evaporated milk is made by removing about 60% of
  the water from fresh milk, concentrating its flavor and nutrients. Although it has
  undergone some processing, it retains many of the properties of regular milk, making
  it distinct from butter, cheese, or yogurt in terms of its composition and use.'
