text: No, "Pheasant Gizzards" and "Pheasant Tenders" should not be merged as they
  are different parts of the pheasant, with different nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses. Pheasant Gizzards are a muscle found in a pheasant's digestive system, while
  Pheasant Tenders are a cut of meat from the pheasant's breast. They are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates, as they refer to distinct entities in the domain of poultry-derived
  food.
