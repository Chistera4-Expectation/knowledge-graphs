text: No, Pheasant Gizzards and Pheasant Nuggets should not be merged as they are
  not semantic or ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from poultry, specifically
  pheasants, they are different cuts of meat with distinct textures and uses in culinary
  applications. Gizzards are a muscle found in the digestive tract of birds and are
  often cooked in a stew or grilled, whereas nuggets are typically made from ground
  or chopped meat and breaded for deep frying. Therefore, they are not duplicate concepts
  but rather distinct food items in the Poultry-derived Food class.
