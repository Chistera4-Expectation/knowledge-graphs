  While "cooked white rice" is a type of rice that has been prepared by cooking, it
  is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. This is
  because they refer to different stages in the process of preparing and consuming
  rice, with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Keeping these terms
  separate allows for more accurate and specific descriptions of food items and their
  properties.'
