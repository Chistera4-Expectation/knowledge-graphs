text: No, the instances 'Goat's Milk' and 'Milk' should not be merged together as
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Goat's Milk is a specific type of
  milk, while Milk is a more general term that can encompass various types of milk,
  including cow's milk, goat's milk, and others. Merging them would lose the specificity
  of goat's milk as a distinct type of milk.
