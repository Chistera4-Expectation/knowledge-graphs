text: ' No. While both "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Chicken Broth" are poultry-derived
  foods, they have different ingredients, preparation methods, nutritional profiles,
  and uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They belong to separate categories of dishes within the broader classification
  of poultry-derived food items.'
