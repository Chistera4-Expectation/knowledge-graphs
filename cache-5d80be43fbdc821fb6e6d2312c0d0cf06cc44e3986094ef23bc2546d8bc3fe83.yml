text: No, "Pheasant Meatballs" and "Quail Meatballs" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of meatballs made
  from poultry, they are made from different types of birds (pheasant and quail, respectively).
  These dishes have distinct flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles, and should
  therefore be considered separate entities in a food classification system.
