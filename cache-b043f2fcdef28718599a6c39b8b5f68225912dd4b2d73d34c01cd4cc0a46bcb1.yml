text: ' Yes. Liqueurs and Liquor are often used interchangeably and refer to the same
  category of alcoholic drinks that are distilled from fermented grains, fruits, or
  vegetables and typically contain between 20% to 50% alcohol by volume (ABV). Therefore,
  they can be considered semantic and ontological duplicates and merged into a single
  instance.'
