text: ' No. While both "Organic Clover Honey" and "Sage Honey" fall under the category
  of honey, they have distinct characteristics that make them different from each
  other. Organic clover honey is made from the nectar of clover flowers and is often
  light-colored with a mildly sweet flavor. On the other hand, sage honey is made
  from the nectar of sage plants and tends to be darker in color with a stronger flavor
  profile. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as
  semantic and ontological duplicates since they are not identical and have unique
  properties.'
