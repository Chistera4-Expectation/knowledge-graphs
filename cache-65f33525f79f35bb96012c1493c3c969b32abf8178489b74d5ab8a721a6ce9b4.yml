text: No, Cremini Mushroom and Oyster Mushroom should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms, they are distinct species
  with different nutritional profiles, flavors, and culinary uses. Cremini Mushrooms
  (Agaricus bisporus) are a type of brown mushroom, while Oyster Mushrooms (Pleurotus
  ostreatus) have a fan-like shape and a mild, earthy flavor. Merging them as duplicates
  would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
