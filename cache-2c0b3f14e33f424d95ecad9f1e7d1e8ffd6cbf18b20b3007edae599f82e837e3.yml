text: No, 'Duck Wings' and 'Pheasant Wings' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of poultry wings, they come from
  different species of birds and may have different nutritional profiles, cooking
  methods, and cultural significance. They are distinct entities and should be treated
  as such.
