text: ' "Sauce" is the most adequate class for itself in this list. A sauce is typically
  a liquid or semi-liquid dish served on or used in preparing other dishes. It can
  be based on a variety of ingredients, including vegetables, fruits, dairy products,
  and spices. Other classes that could potentially contain sauces include "Food Dressing,"
  "Food Seasoning," and "Spice," but these categories have more specific meanings
  and do not encompass all types of sauces.'
