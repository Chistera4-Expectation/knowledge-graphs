text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Onion slices' and 'Onion' are related to the same vegetable, they represent different
  states or forms of the onion. 'Onion slices' refers to a specific preparation or
  cut of the onion, whereas 'Onion' refers to the vegetable itself in its whole form.
  They serve different purposes in recipes and cooking and should be kept separate
  as distinct instances.
