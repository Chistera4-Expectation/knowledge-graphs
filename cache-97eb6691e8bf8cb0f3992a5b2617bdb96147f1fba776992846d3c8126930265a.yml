  Fenugreek seeds (Trigonella foenum-graecum) and kiwi seeds are not semantic nor
  ontological duplicates. They belong to different plant species, have distinct nutritional
  profiles, uses, and health benefits. Fenugreek seeds are commonly used as a spice
  and herb with medicinal properties, while kiwi seeds are typically consumed as part
  of whole kiwifruit, containing essential fatty acids and fiber but differing from
  fenugreek seeds in their overall nutrient content.'
