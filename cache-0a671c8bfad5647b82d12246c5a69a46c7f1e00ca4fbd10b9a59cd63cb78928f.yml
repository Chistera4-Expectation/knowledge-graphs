text: No, Bulgarian Yogurt and Icelandic Yogurt should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics
  and production methods. Bulgarian yogurt is made with specific Lactobacillus bulgaricus
  and Streptococcus thermophilus strains, while Icelandic yogurt, also known as skyr,
  is made with a unique bacterial culture and has a thicker consistency. These differences
  warrant separate classifications within the Yogurt class.
