  While fenugreek seeds and sesame seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, taste, texture, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it
  is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates from a dietary
  perspective. Maintaining separate identities for these seeds allows for accurate
  tracking and understanding of their individual benefits and applications within
  a balanced diet.'
