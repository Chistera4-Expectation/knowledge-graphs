text: No, peanut oil and pumpkin seed oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils,
  they have distinct chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking
  and food preparation. Therefore, they should remain separate instances in a class
  hierarchy.
