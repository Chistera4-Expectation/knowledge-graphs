text: ' Among the given options, none specifically represent Nitrate-containing foods
  as a class. However, if we consider that Nitrates are commonly found in certain
  types of processed meats and vegetables, then the most appropriate class could be
  "Processed Meat" or "Cured Meats". Alternatively, since some vegetables naturally
  contain nitrates, "Leafy Greens" or "Vegetables" might also be considered an acceptable
  choice, but with the understanding that not all vegetables are high in nitrates.'
