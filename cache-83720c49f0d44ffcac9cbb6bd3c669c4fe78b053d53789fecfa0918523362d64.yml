  Although ''Apple filling'' and ''Pineapple'' are semantic and ontologic duplicates,
  they should not be merged together. Each fruit has its own unique nutritional profile
  and health benefits. Merging them together would not only be inaccurate but also
  would lose the specific information associated with each fruit.'
