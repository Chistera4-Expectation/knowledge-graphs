  While both barbecue sauce and dipping sauce can be used for flavoring food, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different properties,
  uses, and ingredients. Barbecue sauce is a type of thick, sweet and tangy sauce
  that is typically made with tomatoes, vinegar, sugar, and various spices, specifically
  used for cooking or marinating meat, especially for barbecuing. On the other hand,
  dipping sauces are any condiment meant to be used as an accompaniment to foods such
  as fries, chicken fingers or egg rolls; these sauces vary widely but could include
  ketchup, ranch dressing, honey mustard, etc., depending on regional preferences
  and cuisine types. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
