text: ' "Edible Vegetal-derived" or simply "Spices" (if referring specifically to
  spice rack ingredients) would not be the most adequate class for the given options
  as they are primarily food categories rather than classes of edibles that include
  spices. A more appropriate class name could be "Herbs and Spices."'
