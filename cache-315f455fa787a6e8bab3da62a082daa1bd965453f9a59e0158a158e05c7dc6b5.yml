text: No, 'Brown rice syrup' and 'Yacon syrup' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are sweeteners, they are derived from different
  sources and have distinct properties and nutritional profiles. Brown rice syrup
  is derived from brown rice, while Yacon syrup is derived from the Yacon plant. They
  should be treated as separate instances in the Sweetener class.
