  The instances "Chicken wings" and "Fried chicken" are not exact duplicates, as they
  refer to different parts of the chicken (wings vs. any cut of meat that is fried).
  While both may belong to the same category of poultry-derived foods, they have distinct
  characteristics and preparation methods, making them separate entities in the context
  of culinary classification.'
