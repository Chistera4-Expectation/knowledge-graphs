text: No, the instances 'Beech Mushroom' and 'Morel Mushroom' should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. These two types of mushrooms belong to different
  species with distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. Merging them would
  not accurately represent their unique properties and uses in a dietary context.
