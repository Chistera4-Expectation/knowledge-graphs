  While both "mechanically separated meat" and "roasted turkey" are types of poultry-derived
  food, they do not represent semantic and ontological duplicates. Mechanically separated
  meat refers to the paste-like substance produced by removing bones (including bone
  marrow) from animal carcasses using high pressure machinery. On the other hand,
  roasted turkey is prepared through cooking an entire turkey at high temperatures
  without submerging it in liquid, resulting in tenderized, flavorful meat. These
  two products have distinct processing methods, nutritional profiles, textures, and
  uses, making them non-duplicative within their category.'
