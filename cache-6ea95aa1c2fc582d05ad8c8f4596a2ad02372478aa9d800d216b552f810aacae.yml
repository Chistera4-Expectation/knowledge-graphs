text: No, the instances 'Flavored Butter' and 'Salted Butter' should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of butter, they
  have distinct properties. 'Flavored Butter' refers to butter with added flavors
  (e.g., garlic, herbs), while 'Salted Butter' refers to butter with added salt. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the differences in these types of butter.
