text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of sauces with unique
  ingredients, flavors, and cultural origins. Hoisin sauce is a Chinese sauce made
  from soybeans, while Teriyaki sauce is a Japanese sauce made from soy sauce, mirin,
  and sugar. While they may have some overlapping ingredients, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
