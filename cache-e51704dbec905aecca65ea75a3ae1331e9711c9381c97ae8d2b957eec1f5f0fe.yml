text: No, these instances should not be merged as they serve different purposes. Electrolyte
  water is a type of water that contains electrolytes, which are minerals that help
  regulate fluid balance in the body. It is commonly consumed to aid hydration and
  replenish electrolytes during or after exercise or in hot weather. On the other
  hand, water for egg wash is a mixture of water and an optional egg yolk or whole
  egg, used as a coating on food items like pastry or bread before baking. The purpose
  of the egg wash is to create a shiny, golden-brown crust on the food. Therefore,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
