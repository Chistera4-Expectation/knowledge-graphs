text: No, 'Alfalfa Honey' and 'Wildflower Honey' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they come from
  different floral sources and have distinct flavor profiles. Alfalfa honey is derived
  from the nectar of alfalfa flowers, while wildflower honey comes from a variety
  of wildflowers. Therefore, they should be kept as separate instances in the Honey
  class.
