text: ' No. While "Pork roast" is a specific cut of pork meat that has been prepared
  in a certain way (roasted), it is not a duplicate of "Pork," which refers to the
  general category of meat from domesticated pigs. Therefore, they should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
