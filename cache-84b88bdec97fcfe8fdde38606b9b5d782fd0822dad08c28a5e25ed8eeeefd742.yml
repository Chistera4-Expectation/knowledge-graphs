text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are types of yogurt, they have different properties and nutritional values.
  Plain yogurt typically contains fewer added ingredients, while probiotic yogurt
  contains live and active cultures that can have additional health benefits. These
  differences make them distinct types of yogurt.
