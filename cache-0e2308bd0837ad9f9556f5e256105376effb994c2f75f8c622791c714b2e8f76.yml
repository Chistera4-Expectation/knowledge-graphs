text: ' No, these two instances should not be merged as they refer to different types
  of beef with distinct nutritional profiles. Grass-fed beef refers to beef from animals
  that have exclusively eaten grass, which results in certain health benefits such
  as higher levels of healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids. On the other hand, lean
  beef describes cuts of meat that are lower in total fat content compared to other
  cuts, regardless of whether the animal was grass-fed or grain-finished. Therefore,
  it''s important to maintain separate instances for each type of beef to accurately
  reflect their unique characteristics.'
