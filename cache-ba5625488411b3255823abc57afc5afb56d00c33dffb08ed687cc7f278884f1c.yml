text: No, the instances 'Breadcrumbs' and 'Grilled Bread' should not be merged together
  as they represent different forms or preparations of bread. Breadcrumbs are typically
  made by processing dry bread into small crumbs, while grilled bread is a slice of
  bread that has been toasted or cooked on a grill. These are distinct and should
  be kept separate in a classification system.
