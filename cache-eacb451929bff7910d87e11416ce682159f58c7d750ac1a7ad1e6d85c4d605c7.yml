text: 'As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspects of these
  bread types, but the decision to merge them as semantic and ontologic duplicates
  should be made by a software engineer or developer based on their requirements and
  the context in which they are being used.


  However, I can mention that while Naan Bread and Pita Bread share similarities,
  they also have distinct differences in terms of ingredients, preparation methods,
  and cultural origins. Naan bread is typically made with all-purpose flour, yeast,
  yogurt, and ghee, and it is a staple in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines. Pita
  bread, on the other hand, is usually made with wheat flour, water, yeast, and salt,
  and it is a staple in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines.


  Given these differences, it may not be appropriate to merge Naan Bread and Pita
  Bread as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Instead, they could be categorized as
  subclasses of a broader "Flatbread" or "Bread" class, with their unique attributes
  and characteristics described within their respective classes.'
