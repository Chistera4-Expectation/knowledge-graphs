text: 'As a dietician, my answer is: No, Lassi Yogurt and Probiotic Yogurt should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both types of
  yogurt may contain probiotics, they are distinct products with different cultural
  and culinary backgrounds. Lassi is a yogurt-based drink from the Indian subcontinent,
  often flavored with spices or fruit, while probiotic yogurt is a category of yogurt
  that specifically contains live and active cultures beneficial for gut health. Although
  they share some commonalities, they are not the same product.'
