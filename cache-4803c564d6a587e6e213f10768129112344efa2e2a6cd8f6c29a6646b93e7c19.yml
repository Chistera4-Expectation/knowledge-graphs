text: ' No. Cherry blossom honey and fireweed honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged. They are two distinct types of honey with unique
  characteristics that set them apart from one another. Although they may share some
  commonalities as both being varieties of honey, merging them would result in loss
  of important distinctions between these specific kinds of honey.'
