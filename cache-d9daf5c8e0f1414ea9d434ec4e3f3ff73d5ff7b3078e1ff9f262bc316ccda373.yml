text: No, the instances 'Dried Cameroon Pepper' and 'Red chili flakes' should not
  be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of
  spices and may have similar uses, they are distinct in origin, flavor, and characteristics.
  Dried Cameroon Pepper is a specific type of pepper from Cameroon, while Red chili
  flakes can refer to dried and flaked red chili peppers from various regions. Merging
  them would lead to a loss of specificity and accuracy in describing the spices.
