text: ' No. Acacia honey and blueberry honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Although they are both types of honey, they come from different botanical sources
  (acacia tree vs blueberry plant) which gives them distinct flavor profiles, colors,
  and properties. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between these two types
  of honey when providing nutritional information or making recommendations for their
  use in a healthy diet.'
