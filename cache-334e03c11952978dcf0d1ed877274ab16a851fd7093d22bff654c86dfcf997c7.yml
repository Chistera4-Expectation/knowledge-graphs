text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of tea with different
  flavors, origins, and potential health benefits. Ceylon tea is a black tea from
  Sri Lanka, while hibiscus tea is an herbal tea made from the hibiscus flower. Although
  they can both be considered types of tea, they have unique characteristics that
  make them different from each other.
