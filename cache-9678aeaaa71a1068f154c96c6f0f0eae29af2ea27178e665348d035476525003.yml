text: ' No. Basmati rice and black rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they are both types of rice. They have different nutritional profiles,
  flavors, textures, culinary uses, and cultural significance. Therefore, it is important
  to distinguish between them when discussing nutrition and food choices.'
