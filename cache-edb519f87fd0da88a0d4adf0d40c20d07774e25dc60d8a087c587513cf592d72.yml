  Although Arborio rice and long grain white rice can both be classified under the
  general category of "rice," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  have distinct properties and uses in cooking due to their different textures and
  flavors. Arborio rice is a short-grain rice with high starch content, which makes
  it ideal for risotto because it releases starch as it cooks, creating a creamy consistency.
  Long grain white rice, on the other hand, has lower starch content and stays separate
  when cooked, making it suitable for dishes like pilaf or stir-fries. Therefore,
  these two types of rice should not be merged as duplicates in a knowledge base focused
  on food and nutrition.'
