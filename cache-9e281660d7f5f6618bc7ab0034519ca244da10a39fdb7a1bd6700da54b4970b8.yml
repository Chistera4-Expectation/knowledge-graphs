text: As a dietician, my focus is on nutrition rather than ontology. However, from
  a culinary and nutritional perspective, Chestnut Honey and Sourwood Honey are different
  types of honey with unique flavors and properties. While they might share some characteristics
  as honey, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. So, the answer is no.
