text: ' No. Idli rice, also known as idli rava or parboiled rice, is a type of rice
  that has been partially boiled in its husk. This process helps to retain more nutrients
  compared to white rice, which is milled and polished, resulting in fewer nutrients.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as they have
  different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking.'
