text: No, Greek Yogurt and Skyr Yogurt should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they share similarities, they have distinct characteristics
  and production methods. Greek Yogurt is strained to remove whey, resulting in a
  thicker consistency, while Skyr Yogurt is made from skim milk and has a similar
  consistency to Greek Yogurt but with a slightly sweeter taste and a slightly lower
  fat content.
