text: No, 'Ostrich Gravy' and 'Ostrich Patties' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from ostrich meat, they
  are distinct types of food with different preparation methods and uses. Gravy is
  a sauce made from meat juices and other ingredients, while patties are formed and
  flattened portions of ground meat. They have different nutritional profiles and
  would not be considered duplicates in a dietary context.
