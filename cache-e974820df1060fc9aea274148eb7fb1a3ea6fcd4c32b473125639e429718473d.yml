text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of fish products with
  distinct characteristics. Fish fillet refers to a boneless piece of fish meat, while
  stockfish is a type of dried fish, typically unsalted and hung to dry for a few
  months. They have different nutritional profiles and preparation methods.
