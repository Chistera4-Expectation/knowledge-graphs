text: ' Out of the given options, ''Edible Herbs'' would be the most appropriate classification.
  While herbs do have some nutritional benefits and can be used to enhance the flavor
  of various dishes, they are not typically classified under any of the other categories
  provided (such as grains like bread or pasta, starchy foods like rice, or specific
  types of food products such as edible oils). Therefore, creating a distinct category
  for them makes sense in this context.'
