text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they both fall under the Poultry-derived
  Food class and are types of stocks, Guinea Fowl Stock and Turkey Stock are different
  in terms of the poultry used to create the stock. They have distinct flavors and
  nutritional profiles, which makes them separate entities within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
