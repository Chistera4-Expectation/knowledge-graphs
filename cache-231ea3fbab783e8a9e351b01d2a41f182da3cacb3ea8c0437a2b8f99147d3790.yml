text: ' The most adequate class for "Soup" from the given options is "Drink." Although
  soup can be eaten with a spoon, it is typically consumed as a liquid or semi-liquid
  food item. Therefore, categorizing it under "Drink" would be more appropriate than
  grouping it with alcoholic drinks, infusions, juices, milk, or tea.'
