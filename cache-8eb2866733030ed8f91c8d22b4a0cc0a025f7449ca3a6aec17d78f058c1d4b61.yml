text: No, avocado oil and peanut oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct chemical
  compositions, properties, and uses in cooking and food preparation. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each oil.
