text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  they both fall under the category of pickled foods, pickled ginger and pickles are
  different types of vegetables with distinct flavors, uses, and nutritional profiles.
  Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the Edible Vegetable
  class.
