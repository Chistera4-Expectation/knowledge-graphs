text: No, Green Tea and Herbal Tea should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of tea with different properties and compositions. Green tea is made from
  the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant and contains caffeine, while herbal tea
  is made from various herbs, spices, and other plants and typically does not contain
  caffeine. They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
