text: Yes, as a dietician, I would consider "Shiitake Mushroom" and "Shiitake mushrooms"
  to be semantic and ontological duplicates. They both refer to the same species of
  mushroom, Lentinula edodes. It is common to have slight variations in capitalization
  or pluralization when referring to the same thing, but they can be considered as
  synonymous in this context.
