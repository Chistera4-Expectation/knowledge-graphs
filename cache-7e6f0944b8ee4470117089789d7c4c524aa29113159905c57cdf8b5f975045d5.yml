  Cantaloupe seeds and chia seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates, even
  though they are both types of edible seeds. They have different nutritional profiles,
  culinary uses, and cultural significance. Cantaloupe seeds contain moderate amounts
  of vitamins A, B, and C, magnesium, potassium, and iron, while chia seeds provide
  significant levels of omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, protein, calcium, phosphorus,
  and manganese. Additionally, cantaloupe seeds are often discarded due to their gelatinous
  coating, but can still be eaten after roasting, whereas chia seeds are widely consumed
  for their health benefits and texture when soaked in liquid. Therefore, it is essential
  to maintain separate entries for these two distinct food items.'
