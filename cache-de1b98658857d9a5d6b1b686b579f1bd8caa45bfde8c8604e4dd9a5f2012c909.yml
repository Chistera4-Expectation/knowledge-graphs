text: ' "Tea" would be the most adequately classified as "Non-alcoholic Beverage",
  as it is a drink that does not contain alcohol. However, if we are looking for a
  more specific classification within the given options, then "Tea" could be categorized
  as "Hot Beverage". This category includes drinks like tea and coffee that are typically
  served hot but may also be consumed cold.'
