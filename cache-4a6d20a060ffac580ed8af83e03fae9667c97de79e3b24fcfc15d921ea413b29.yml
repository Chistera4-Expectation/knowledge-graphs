text: ' No. Jasmine rice and sushi rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While both are types of rice, they have distinct
  characteristics, uses, and cultural significance. Jasmine rice is a long-grain variety
  from Thailand with a floral aroma and sticky texture when cooked, often used in
  Southeast Asian dishes. Sushi rice, on the other hand, is a short-grain Japanese
  rice that becomes slightly sticky after cooking, ideal for making sushi rolls and
  other traditional Japanese dishes. Merging them would result in loss of essential
  information about their unique properties and applications.'
