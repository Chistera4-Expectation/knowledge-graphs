  While Chinkiang vinegar and white vinegar may both fall under the category of "vinegars,"
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different flavors, appearances,
  uses, and origins. Chinkiang vinegar is a dark, richly-flavored Chinese rice vinegar
  made from glutinous rice, wheat bran, and water, while white vinegar (also known
  as distilled white vinegar) is typically clear with a sharp, acidic taste derived
  from grain alcohol. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  as duplicates in a Food Seasoning class.'
