text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both "Chicken Soup" and "Duck
  Soup" are poultry-derived foods, they are different types of soups with distinct
  ingredients and potentially different nutritional profiles. Therefore, they should
  be considered separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
