text: ' No. Balsamic Vinegar Dressing and Citrus Ginger Dressing are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. While both are types of dressings, they have distinct
  ingredients and flavors. Balsamic Vinegar Dressing is typically made with balsamic
  vinegar, olive oil, and various spices, while Citrus Ginger Dressing usually contains
  citrus juice, ginger, and other seasonings. Therefore, they remain unique entities
  in the food domain.'
