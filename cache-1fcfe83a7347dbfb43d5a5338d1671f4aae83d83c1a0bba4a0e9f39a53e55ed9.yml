text: "No, B\xE9chamel sauce and Pesto sauce should not be merged as semantic and\
  \ ontologic duplicates. Although both are sauces, they have distinct ingredients,\
  \ preparation methods, and uses in culinary contexts. Merging them would result\
  \ in a loss of important information about each sauce's unique characteristics."
