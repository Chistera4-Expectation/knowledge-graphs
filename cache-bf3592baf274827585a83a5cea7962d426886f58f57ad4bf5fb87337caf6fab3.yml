  While red pepper flakes and habanero peppers are both types of spicy seasonings
  made from peppers, they have distinct differences in taste, heat level, and culinary
  uses. Red pepper flakes typically come from crushed dried cayenne peppers and provide
  moderate to high heat with a slightly sweet flavor. Habanero peppers, on the other
  hand, are much hotter than red pepper flakes (scoville units for habaneros can range
  from 100,000-350,000 compared to 30,000-50,000 for red pepper flakes), possessing
  a fruity and slightly smoky flavor profile. Merging them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates would not accurately represent their unique characteristics and applications
  within cooking.'
