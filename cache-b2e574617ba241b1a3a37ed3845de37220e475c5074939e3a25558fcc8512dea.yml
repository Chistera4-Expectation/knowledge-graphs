text: No, they should not be merged as they have different nutritional profiles and
  chemical compositions. Brown rice syrup is derived from brown rice, while brown
  sugar is derived from sugar cane or sugar beets. They may have some similarities,
  but they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
