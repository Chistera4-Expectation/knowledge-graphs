  While both "rice" are edible products that contain rice, they have different uses
  and culinary properties. Short-grain rice is a type of rice with short, plump grains
  that tend to stick together when cooked, making it ideal for dishes like sushi and
  risotto. On the other hand, rice paper wrappers are thin sheets made from rice flour,
  water, and sometimes tapioca starch, which are used to make various Asian dishes
  such as spring rolls and summer rolls. They serve different purposes and cannot
  be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
