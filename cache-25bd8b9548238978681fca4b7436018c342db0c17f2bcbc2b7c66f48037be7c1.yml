text: ' No, Chia seeds and Quinoa seeds are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both are edible seeds that have gained popularity for their health benefits,
  they belong to different botanical families (Lamiaceae and Amaranthaceae, respectively)
  and possess unique nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is essential to maintain
  them as separate entities when discussing dietary options.'
