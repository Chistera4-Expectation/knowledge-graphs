text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both "Turkey Meatballs" and "Turkey Sausage" are derived from turkey, they have
  different preparation methods and textures. Turkey meatballs are typically made
  from ground turkey, combined with various seasonings, shaped into balls, and cooked.
  Turkey sausage, on the other hand, is ground turkey meat mixed with seasonings and
  stuffed into a casing, which is then cooked. These differences in preparation and
  presentation result in distinct food items that should not be considered duplicates.
