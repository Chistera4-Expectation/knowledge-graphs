text: No, 'Carrot juice' and 'Juice' should not be merged as they are different types
  of juice. 'Juice' is a general term for a liquid made by extracting the natural
  liquid from fruits and vegetables, while 'Carrot juice' specifically refers to juice
  made from carrots. Although they both fall under the category of juices, they are
  not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
