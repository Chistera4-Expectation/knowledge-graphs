text: No, 'Kiwi juice' and 'Papaya juice' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both juices, they are distinct types of
  juice made from different fruits with unique nutritional profiles. Merging them
  would result in a loss of specificity and accuracy in describing the individual
  juices.
