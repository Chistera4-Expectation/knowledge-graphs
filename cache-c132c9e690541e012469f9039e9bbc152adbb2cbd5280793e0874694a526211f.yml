text: No, Canola Oil and Safflower Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different
  nutritional profiles, chemical compositions, and uses in cooking. Merging them together
  would not accurately represent the unique properties of each oil.
