text: ' No. Although organic and pasture-raised beef share some similarities, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Organic beef refers to cattle that are
  raised without the use of hormones, antibiotics, genetically modified organisms,
  or conventional pesticides, while pasture-raised beef comes from animals that have
  been allowed to graze freely on open pastures for most of their lives. While it
  is possible for beef to be both organic and pasture-raised, these terms describe
  different aspects of how the animal was raised and should therefore be treated as
  distinct concepts.'
