text: ' "Beverage" would be the most appropriate class to categorize both coffee and
  tea, as they are both caffeinated hot drinks that can be consumed as part of a balanced
  diet. Other potential classes could include "Caffeinated Beverages," "Hot Drinks,"
  or simply "Drinks." However, these names may be less concise than "Beverage" and
  still encompass other items beyond just coffee and tea.'
