  While both bulking agents and condiments can impact the texture, flavor, and overall
  sensory experience of sauces, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Bulking
  agents are substances added to increase volume without significantly changing the
  taste, often used for their textural properties (e.g., flour, cornstarch). On the
  other hand, condiments are primarily added for seasoning and enhancing flavor profiles
  (e.g., ketchup, mustard). Merging them would disregard these distinct functions
  within sauce preparation.'
