text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates because they
  are different types of poultry-derived food products. Duck gizzards are a specific
  part of the duck, while duck sausage is a processed product made from ground duck
  meat and other ingredients. They have different nutritional profiles and uses in
  cooking.
