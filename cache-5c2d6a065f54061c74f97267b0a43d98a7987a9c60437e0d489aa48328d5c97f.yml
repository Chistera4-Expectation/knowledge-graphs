text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both are types of honey, they are distinct varieties with unique flavors and nutritional
  profiles. Buckwheat honey is darker, richer in antioxidants, and has a stronger
  flavor compared to raspberry honey, which is lighter and has a fruity taste.
