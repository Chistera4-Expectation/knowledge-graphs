text: No, "Chicken Meatballs" and "Chicken Thighs" should not be merged together as
  they are distinct food items with different preparation methods and nutritional
  profiles. Chicken Meatballs are made by combining ground chicken with various ingredients,
  shaping them into balls, and cooking them, while Chicken Thighs are a specific cut
  of chicken that is cooked whole.
