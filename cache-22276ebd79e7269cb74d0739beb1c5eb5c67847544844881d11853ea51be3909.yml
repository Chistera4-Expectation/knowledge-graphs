text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although both "Ostrich Drumsticks" and "Ostrich Thighs" are derived from ostriches,
  they are distinct cuts of meat with different textures and cooking properties. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
