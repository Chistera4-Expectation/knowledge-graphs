text: As a dietician, I can provide input on the nutritional aspect, but for the ontological
  and semantic analysis, I would recommend consulting a knowledge engineer or a semantic
  web expert. From a nutritional perspective, 'Chili sauce' and 'Sauce' can be considered
  as different types of sauces, as chili sauce contains chili peppers, which may have
  a different nutritional profile compared to other sauces. However, merging them
  as instances in a class may depend on the specific context and purpose of the classification.
