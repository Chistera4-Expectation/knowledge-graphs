  While coconut oil and corn oil may share some common characteristics as types of
  edible vegetable oils, they have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional
  profiles, culinary uses, and sources. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Coconut oil is extracted from the kernel or meat of mature coconuts and has a high
  saturated fat content (approximately 90%). It is solid at room temperature and resistant
  to rancidity due to its high saturation level. Coconut oil also contains medium-chain
  triglycerides (MCTs), which are metabolized differently than long-chain fatty acids
  found in other oils. MCTs can provide quick energy and have been studied for potential
  health benefits related to weight loss, brain function, and exercise performance.


  On the other hand, corn oil is obtained by pressing corn germ and has a higher unsaturated
  fat content compared to coconut oil (around 60%, with about 25% polyunsaturated
  fats). Due to its lower saturation levels, corn oil remains liquid at room temperature
  and is more prone to oxidation and spoilage if not stored properly. Corn oil is
  often used in cooking because of its mild flavor and ability to maintain stability
  under heat.


  Given these differences, it would be misleading to treat coconut oil and corn oil
  as identical entities. Instead, each type of oil should be recognized for its unique
  properties and applications.'
