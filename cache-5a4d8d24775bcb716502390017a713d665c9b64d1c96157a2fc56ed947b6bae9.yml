text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are derived from poultry (chicken),
  they serve different purposes and are distinct food items. Chicken stock is a liquid
  made by simmering chicken bones, while chicken thighs are a cut of meat from the
  thigh area of the chicken. They belong to the same class but are not semantic or
  ontologic duplicates.
