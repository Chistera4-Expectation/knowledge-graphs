text: "As a dietician, I can provide information based on the nutritional content\
  \ and characteristics of these two food items. While both 'Ostrich Thighs' and 'Ostrich'\
  \ are derived from the same animal, they are not exactly the same in terms of their\
  \ nutritional content and preparation methods. \n\nOstrich Thighs specifically refer\
  \ to the thigh portion of the bird, which may have a slightly different nutritional\
  \ profile and cooking requirements compared to the rest of the ostrich meat. Therefore,\
  \ I would not consider them as semantic and ontological duplicates. However, they\
  \ are closely related and should be treated as such when discussing the nutritional\
  \ aspects of ostrich-derived food."
