  While coriander powder and red chili powder may both fall under the category of
  spices, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct
  flavors, uses, and chemical compositions. Coriander powder is made from ground coriander
  seeds, which has a warm, slightly citrusy flavor commonly used in Indian, Middle
  Eastern, and Mexican cuisine. On the other hand, red chili powder consists of crushed
  dried red chilies that provide heat and pungency to dishes, mainly found in various
  South Asian, Latin American, and Mediterranean cooking. Therefore, merging them
  as duplicates would lead to an oversimplification and loss of meaningful information
  about their unique properties and applications.'
