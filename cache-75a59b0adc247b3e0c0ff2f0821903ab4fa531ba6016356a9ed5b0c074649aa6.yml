  While both "comb honey" and "honey" are related to bee products, they have distinct
  differences from a semantic and ontological perspective.


  Ontologically speaking, they represent different types of substances derived from
  bees: one is pure unprocessed honey with its original wax comb (comb honey), while
  the other refers to strained or extracted honey without the wax (honey). Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.


  Semantically, their meanings differ too. While "honey" generally refers to the sweet,
  sticky substance produced by bees, "comb honey" has a more specific meaning that
  includes both the honey and the hexagonal wax cells made by honeybees to store the
  honey. Merging these two terms into one would result in loss of important distinctions
  between them.'
