text: No, the instances 'Grapefruit juice' and 'Kiwi juice' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates because they represent different types of
  juices made from distinct fruits with unique nutritional profiles. Merging them
  would lead to a loss of specific information and potentially misleading nutritional
  advice.
