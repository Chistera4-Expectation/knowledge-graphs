text: " No.\n\nWhile both \"tomato sauce\" and \"canned diced tomatoes\" are related\
  \ to tomatoes and may even contain similar ingredients, they serve different purposes\
  \ in cooking and have distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it would not be\
  \ appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.\n\nFor instance,\
  \ canned diced tomatoes typically consist of whole tomatoes that have been peeled,\
  \ cored, seeded, and cut into dice, while tomato sauce is a pur\xE9e made from cooked\
  \ and strained tomatoes. These differences affect their culinary uses and the textures\
  \ they bring to dishes.\n\nMoreover, merging these terms could lead to confusion\
  \ regarding their respective nutritional content, which varies due to processing\
  \ methods and additional ingredients used in each product. By maintaining separate\
  \ identities for these items, we ensure greater accuracy and clarity when discussing\
  \ nutrition and food preparation."
