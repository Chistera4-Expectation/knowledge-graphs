text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of tea with distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and origins. English Breakfast Tea is a blend of black
  teas, while White Tea is a type of tea made from the young leaves and buds of the
  Camellia sinensis plant, which is harvested before the leaves fully open and are
  processed differently. They have different nutritional profiles and health benefits,
  so they should be treated as separate entities in a dietician context.
