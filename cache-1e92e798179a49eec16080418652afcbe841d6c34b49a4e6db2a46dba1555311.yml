text: No, Clarified Butter and Salted Butter should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the general category of butter,
  they have distinct properties and uses. Clarified butter has had the milk solids
  and water removed, resulting in a higher smoke point and a longer shelf life, making
  it suitable for high-temperature cooking. Salted butter, on the other hand, has
  added salt for flavor and preservation, which makes it ideal for spreading on bread
  and using in baked goods. Therefore, they are separate instances within the Butter
  class.
