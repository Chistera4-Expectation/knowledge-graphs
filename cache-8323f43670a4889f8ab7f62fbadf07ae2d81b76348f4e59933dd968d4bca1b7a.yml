text: No, the instances 'Australian Yogurt' and 'Non-Dairy Yogurt' should not be merged
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of yogurt, they
  have distinct characteristics. Australian Yogurt refers to yogurt made in Australia,
  and Non-Dairy Yogurt refers to yogurt made without dairy, such as coconut or almond
  milk-based yogurts. They are not duplicates in terms of their semantics or ontology.
