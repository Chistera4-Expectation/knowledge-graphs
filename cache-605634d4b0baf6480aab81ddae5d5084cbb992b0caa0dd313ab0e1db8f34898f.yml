  The two instances, "Sliced green onions" and "Collard greens," are not duplicate
  entries. They refer to different types of vegetables with distinct characteristics,
  flavors, textures, and culinary uses. Sliced green onions are a specific preparation
  method for the green onion plant, while collard greens are a type of leafy green
  vegetable from the Brassica family. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
