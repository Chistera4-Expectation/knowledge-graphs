text: No, Andouille sausage and Italian sausage should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of sausage made from pork, they have
  distinct differences in flavor, ingredients, and cultural origins. Andouille sausage
  is typically made from smoked pork and has a spicy, smoky flavor, originating from
  France and commonly used in Cajun and Creole cuisine. Italian sausage, on the other
  hand, is made from ground pork and seasoned with fennel, garlic, and other herbs,
  originating from Italy and commonly used in Italian cuisine.
