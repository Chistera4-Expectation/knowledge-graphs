text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Quail Drumsticks' and 'Quail Sausage' are derived from quail, they are different
  types of food products with distinct preparation methods and nutritional profiles.
  Merging them together would not accurately reflect the variety of poultry-derived
  food options available.
