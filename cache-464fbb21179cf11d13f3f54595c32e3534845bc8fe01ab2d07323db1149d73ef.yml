text: No, French Yogurt and Skyr Yogurt should not be merged together as they are
  different types of yogurt with distinct characteristics and origins. French Yogurt
  typically refers to a thicker, creamier yogurt with a mild flavor, while Skyr Yogurt
  is a traditional Icelandic product, typically strained for a thicker consistency,
  and has a slightly tart taste.
