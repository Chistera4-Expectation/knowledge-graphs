  While both chili powder and chili bean paste are used to add flavor to food, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different ingredients
  and uses in cooking. Chili powder is made from dried ground chilies and may include
  other spices such as cumin or garlic, while chili bean paste is typically made from
  mashed fermented soybeans and chilies. These differences mean that they cannot be
  considered duplicates of each other.'
