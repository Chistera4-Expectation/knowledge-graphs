text: "As a dietician, I can provide insight into the nutritional aspects of these\
  \ breads, but the decision to merge instances in a programming context would be\
  \ best addressed by a software developer or someone with expertise in that area.\
  \ \n\nFrom a dietary perspective, Flaxseed Bread and Naan Bread have different nutritional\
  \ profiles. Flaxseed Bread is typically made with flaxseeds, which are rich in omega-3\
  \ fatty acids, fiber, and various nutrients. Naan Bread, on the other hand, is an\
  \ Indian flatbread made with flour, yogurt, and ghee (clarified butter), which gives\
  \ it a richer and more calorie-dense composition.\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier,\
  \ the decision to merge instances in a programming context would depend on other\
  \ factors such as the intended purpose and structure of the Bread class, as well\
  \ as the specific requirements and goals of the project."
