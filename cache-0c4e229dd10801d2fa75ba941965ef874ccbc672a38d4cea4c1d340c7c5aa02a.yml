  While both "chicken curry" and "chicken nuggets" are poultry-derived foods, they
  cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different
  ingredients, preparation methods, nutritional profiles, and often serve distinct
  culinary purposes. Chicken curry typically consists of chicken pieces cooked with
  various spices, herbs, vegetables, and sauces, while chicken nuggets are usually
  made from ground chicken meat mixed with other ingredients, formed into small shapes,
  and deep-fried. Therefore, these two food items do not represent duplicate concepts
  within the context of poultry-derived foods.'
