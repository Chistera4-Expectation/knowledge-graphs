  Although both breadcrumbs and cornbread are types of bread, they serve different
  purposes and have unique ingredients and preparation methods. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Breadcrumbs
  refer to small pieces of bread used as a trail or marker, while cornbread is a type
  of quick bread made with cornmeal. Merging these two concepts would result in a
  loss of important distinctions between them.'
