text: No, Herbal Tea and Lavender Tea should not be merged together as they are not
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Herbal tea is a broad category of teas made from
  various herbs, while Lavender Tea is a specific type of herbal tea made from the
  lavender plant. They can coexist in the same class but represent different types
  of herbal teas.
