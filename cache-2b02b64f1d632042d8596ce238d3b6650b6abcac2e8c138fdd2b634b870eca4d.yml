text: ' "Food Seasoning" would be the most appropriate class for condiments. Condiments
  are typically used to add flavor to food, and they can include items like ketchup,
  mustard, mayonnaise, soy sauce, hot sauce, and vinegar. These all fit within the
  category of "food seasonings," which refers to substances that are added to food
  to enhance its flavor or preserve it. Other classes such as "Sauce" or "Spice" might
  also contain some types of condiments but have broader definitions and could include
  non-condiment foods.'
