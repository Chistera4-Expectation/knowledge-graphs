text: No, Castor Oil and Sesame Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetal oils, they have distinct
  properties, uses, and origins. Castor oil is derived from the seeds of the castor
  oil plant (Ricinus communis), while sesame oil is extracted from the seeds of the
  sesame plant (Sesamum indicum). They have different nutritional profiles, uses,
  and cultural significance, and therefore should be treated as separate entities
  in a classification system.
