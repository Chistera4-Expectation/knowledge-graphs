  While both coconut oil and palm nut soup base are types of edible oils, they have
  distinct differences in their composition, usage, and production processes that
  make them non-duplicate entities in terms of semantics and ontology. Coconut oil
  is extracted from the meat of matured coconuts, primarily contains medium-chain
  triglycerides (MCTs), and is used for various culinary purposes and cosmetic applications.
  On the other hand, palm nut soup base typically refers to a blended mixture of ingredients
  such as palm nuts, peppers, onions, and seasonings, which may contain some amount
  of oil derived from the palm fruit but cannot be considered identical to pure coconut
  oil. Merging these two instances would lead to oversimplification and loss of essential
  information regarding each unique product.'
