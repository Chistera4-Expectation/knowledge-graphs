  Sage honey and strawberry honey are both types of honey, but they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they come from different plant sources. Sage honey
  is made by bees that collect nectar primarily from sage plants, while strawberry
  honey is made by bees that gather nectar mainly from strawberries. Therefore, these
  two honeys have distinct flavors, colors, and properties due to their unique botanical
  origins. Merging them would lose this important information and create confusion
  about the differences between the two varieties.'
