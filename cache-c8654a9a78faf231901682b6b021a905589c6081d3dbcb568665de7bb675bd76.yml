text: No, Arborio Rice and Japonica Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics
  and uses. Arborio Rice is a medium-grain rice commonly used in risotto dishes, while
  Japonica Rice is a short-grain rice primarily used in sushi and other Japanese dishes.
  Merging them would not accurately represent their unique properties and applications.
