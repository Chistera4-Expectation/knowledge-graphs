text: No, 'Chicken Broth' and 'Chicken Liver' should not be merged together as they
  are distinct food items with different nutritional profiles. Chicken Broth is a
  liquid made by simmering chicken bones, meat, and sometimes vegetables, while Chicken
  Liver is the liver of a chicken, which is a solid organ meat. They both come from
  the same animal but serve different purposes in cooking and have different nutritional
  values.
