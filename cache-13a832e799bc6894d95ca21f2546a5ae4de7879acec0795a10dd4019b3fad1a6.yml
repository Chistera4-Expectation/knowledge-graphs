text: As a dietician, my focus is on the nutritional and health aspects of food rather
  than classifications and ontologies. However, from a food and ingredient perspective,
  'Cinnamon Stick' and 'Cinnamon' are not exact duplicates. 'Cinnamon' can refer to
  the ground spice made from the bark of Cinnamomum trees, while 'Cinnamon Stick'
  refers to the whole bark rolled into a stick form. They are different forms of the
  same spice, but not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
