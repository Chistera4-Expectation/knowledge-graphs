  Old Bay seasoning and seasoning cubes are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They are two distinct types of food seasonings that have different ingredients,
  uses, and forms (Old Bay is typically a blend of spices while seasoning cubes are
  usually made of dehydrated vegetables, herbs, and flavor enhancers). Therefore,
  they should not be merged as duplicates.'
