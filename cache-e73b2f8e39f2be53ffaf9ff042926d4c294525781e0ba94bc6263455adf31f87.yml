text: No, Avocado Oil and Hazelnut Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils, they
  have different properties, nutritional values, and uses. Avocado Oil is high in
  monounsaturated fats and has a high smoke point, making it suitable for cooking
  at high temperatures. Hazelnut Oil, on the other hand, is rich in polyunsaturated
  fats and is often used as a finishing oil in salad dressings or as a flavor enhancer
  in recipes.
