text: No, "Chicken Nuggets" and "Chicken Stock" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from chicken, they are different
  types of food products with distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and
  uses in cooking. Chicken nuggets are a processed, breaded, and fried product, while
  chicken stock is a liquid broth made by simmering chicken bones and other ingredients.
