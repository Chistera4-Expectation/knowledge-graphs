text: ' No. While both carbohydrates and protein are nutrients found in cheese, they
  serve different purposes and are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Carbohydrates
  provide energy to the body, while protein is essential for building and repairing
  tissues. Keeping these two properties separate allows for more detailed analysis
  of the nutritional content of cheese.'
