text: No, Argan oil and Hazelnut oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Argan oil is rich in vitamin E and has
  a nutty flavor, while Hazelnut oil has a higher smoke point and is commonly used
  in cooking. They are not duplicates but rather different types of edible vegetable
  oils.
