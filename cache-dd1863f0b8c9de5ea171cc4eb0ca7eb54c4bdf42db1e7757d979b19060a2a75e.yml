text: As a dietician, I can provide insights into the nutritional aspects of these
  bread types, but the decision to merge them as semantic and ontologic duplicates
  in a programming context is beyond my expertise. However, I can share that Naan
  Bread and Rye Bread are different in terms of ingredients, preparation methods,
  and nutritional profiles. Naan Bread is typically made with flour, water, yeast,
  and yogurt, while Rye Bread is made with rye flour, water, and yeast. Therefore,
  they are not identical in terms of their composition or characteristics.
