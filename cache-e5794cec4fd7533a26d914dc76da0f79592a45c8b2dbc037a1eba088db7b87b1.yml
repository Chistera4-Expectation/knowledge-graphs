text: No, Energy drinks and Sports drinks should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both types of drinks can contain caffeine and other
  stimulants, they have distinct purposes and intended consumers. Energy drinks are
  typically marketed towards individuals seeking an energy boost or improved mental
  focus, while Sports drinks are designed to replenish electrolytes and provide hydration
  during physical activity. Therefore, they should be treated as separate categories
  in a classification system.
