text: No, Quail Eggs and Quail Stock should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from quails, they are different
  food items with distinct nutritional properties and culinary uses. Quail Eggs are
  a source of protein and various vitamins and minerals, while Quail Stock is a liquid
  made from simmering quail bones, meat, and vegetables, which can be used as a base
  for soups, sauces, and other dishes.
