text: ' No. While both Asian Sesame Dressing and Soy Sauce Dressing may contain soy
  sauce as an ingredient, they are distinct food items with different compositions
  and uses. Asian Sesame Dressing is primarily sesame-based with soy sauce added for
  flavor, while Soy Sauce Dressing is typically soy sauce mixed with other ingredients
  like vinegar, sugar, and spices to create a dressing.'
