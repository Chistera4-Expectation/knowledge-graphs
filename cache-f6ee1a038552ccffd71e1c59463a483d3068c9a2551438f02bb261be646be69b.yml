  Irish Coffee and strong coffee are different types of coffee with distinct characteristics.
  Irish Coffee is a specific coffee recipe that includes whiskey, sugar, and cream,
  while strong coffee refers to a coffee that has a higher concentration of caffeine
  or a more robust flavor. They are not duplicates, but rather distinct concepts within
  the broader category of coffee.
