text: No, Rice Rolls and Short-grain Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both involve rice, they represent different types of dishes or
  rice varieties. Rice Rolls are a dish made with rice and other ingredients, while
  Short-grain Rice refers to a specific type of rice grain. They have different properties,
  uses, and nutritional values, and thus should remain as separate instances.
