text: No, Chili oil and Soybean oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have different
  properties, uses, and ingredients. Chili oil is made from soybean oil, chili peppers,
  and other seasonings, while soybean oil is derived directly from soybeans. The two
  oils serve different purposes in cooking and have distinct flavors.
