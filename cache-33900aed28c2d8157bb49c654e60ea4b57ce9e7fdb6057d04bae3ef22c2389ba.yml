text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of yogurt with distinct
  characteristics. Fat-Free Yogurt refers to a type of yogurt with no added fat, while
  Savory Yogurt refers to a type of yogurt with savory flavors, which may or may not
  be fat-free. These are different properties and should be kept as separate instances.
