text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'Guinea Fowl Meat' and
  'Quail Meatballs' are poultry-derived foods, they are different in terms of the
  type of poultry (Guinea fowl vs. quail) and the form of the dish (meat vs. meatballs).
  Merging them as semantic and ontologic duplicates would not accurately represent
  their unique characteristics.
