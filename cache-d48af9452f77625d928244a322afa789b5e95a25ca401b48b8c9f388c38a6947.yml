text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct types of sauces
  with different ingredients and uses. Enchilada sauce is typically made with chili
  peppers and spices, while Hoisin sauce is a sweet and salty sauce made from soybeans,
  vinegar, and various spices. They serve different purposes in cuisine and have different
  flavor profiles.
