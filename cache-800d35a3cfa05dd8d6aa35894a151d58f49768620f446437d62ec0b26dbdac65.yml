text: ' No. Olive oil dressing and soy sauce dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. While both may be used as dressings, they have distinct ingredients
  and characteristics. Olive oil dressing is typically made primarily from olive oil,
  often with added herbs or spices, while soy sauce dressing contains soy sauce as
  its main ingredient, sometimes combined with other elements such as vinegar or sugar.'
