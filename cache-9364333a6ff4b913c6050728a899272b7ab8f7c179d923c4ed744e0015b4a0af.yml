text: No, the instances 'Seeds' and 'Watermelon Seeds' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the broader category
  of seeds, they have distinct characteristics and uses. Watermelon seeds, for example,
  have different nutritional values and are often consumed differently than seeds
  in general. It is essential to maintain the distinction between these two instances
  to provide accurate information and advice.
