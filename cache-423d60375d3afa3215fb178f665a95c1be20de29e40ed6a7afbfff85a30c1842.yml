text: ' No. Shredded mozzarella cheese and category of cheese are not semantic and
  ontological duplicates because they represent different concepts within the domain
  of cheese. Shredded mozzarella cheese is a specific type of cheese that has been
  shredded into small pieces, while "category of cheese" refers to a broader concept
  encompassing all types of cheeses. Therefore, these two instances should remain
  separate for clarity and accuracy in an ontology or knowledge graph related to cheese.'
