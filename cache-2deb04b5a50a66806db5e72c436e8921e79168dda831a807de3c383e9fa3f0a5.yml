text: ' No. Dried red pepper flakes and white pepper powder are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they belong to the same general category of spices. They
  have different tastes, appearances, uses, and chemical compositions due to coming
  from different varieties of peppers (usually cayenne for red pepper flakes and either
  black or green peppercorns for white pepper). Therefore, it is important to keep
  them separate in any classification system.'
