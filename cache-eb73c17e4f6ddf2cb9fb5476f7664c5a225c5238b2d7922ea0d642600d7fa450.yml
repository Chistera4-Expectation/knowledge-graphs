text: ' No. Honey mustard dressing and lemon herb dressing are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While they may both fall under the category of "food dressings," they
  have distinct ingredients and flavors that make them unique from one another. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
