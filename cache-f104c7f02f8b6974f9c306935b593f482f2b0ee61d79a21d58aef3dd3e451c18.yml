text: No, Glutinous Rice and Japonica Rice should not be merged as they are distinct
  types of rice with different characteristics. Glutinous Rice has a higher starch
  content, making it sticky when cooked, while Japonica Rice is a short-grain variety
  with a higher amylopectin content, which gives it a sticky texture but not as sticky
  as Glutinous Rice. They have different culinary uses and nutritional profiles, so
  they should be kept as separate instances in the Rice class.
