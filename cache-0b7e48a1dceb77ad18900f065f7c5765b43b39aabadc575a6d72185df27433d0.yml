  The term "mushroom" refers to a broad category of fungal fruiting bodies that encompasses
  many different species, including shiitake mushrooms. Shiitake mushrooms are a specific
  type of mushroom with its own unique characteristics, nutritional profile, and culinary
  uses. Therefore, it is not accurate to merge the two terms as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
