text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of yogurt, they
  have distinct properties and characteristics. Frozen Yogurt is a frozen dessert
  made from yogurt, and Probiotic Yogurt is yogurt that contains live and active cultures
  beneficial to gut health. Merging them together would not accurately represent their
  differences.
