text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are edible crustaceans,
  they belong to different taxonomic families and have distinct characteristics. Crab
  meat comes from crustaceans like blue crabs, which are commonly consumed as food,
  while horseshoe crab is a marine animal with a different biology and is not typically
  consumed as food.
