  While both cultured butter and herb butter are types of butter, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their production process and flavor profile. Cultured butter
  is made by adding bacterial cultures to the cream before churning, which gives it
  a tangy, slightly sour taste and a longer shelf life. Herb butter, on the other
  hand, is made by mixing softened butter with chopped fresh herbs such as parsley,
  basil, or thyme, giving it a fragrant and savory flavor. These differences make
  them distinct products, rather than duplicates.'
