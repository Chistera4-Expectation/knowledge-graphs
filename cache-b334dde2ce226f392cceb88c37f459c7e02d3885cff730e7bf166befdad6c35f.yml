  The two instances, "Mango" and "Spicy Mango Salsa," are not identical in their entirety.
  Although they both contain mangoes, they have different names, textures, flavors,
  nutritional values, culinary applications, and possibly other characteristics that
  set them apart from one another. They can coexist independently without causing
  any confusion because they represent distinct ideas or concepts within the domain
  of edible fruits. Therefore, merging them would not be appropriate.'
