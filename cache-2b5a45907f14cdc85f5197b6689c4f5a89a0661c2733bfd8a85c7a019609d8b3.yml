text: No, the instances 'Darjeeling Tea' and 'Infused Tea' should not be merged together
  as they are different types of tea with distinct properties and characteristics.
  Darjeeling Tea is a specific variety of black tea grown in the Darjeeling district
  of India, while Infused Tea refers to any tea that has been steeped with additional
  ingredients like herbs, fruits, or spices to enhance its flavor and health benefits.
  Merging these two instances would not accurately represent the differences between
  them.
