text: No, these instances should not be merged together as they are different types
  of edible mushrooms with distinct characteristics and uses in cooking. Maitake mushrooms,
  also known as hen-of-the-woods, are a popular and flavorful type of mushroom, while
  wood ear mushrooms are characterized by their crunchy texture and are often used
  in Asian cuisine.
