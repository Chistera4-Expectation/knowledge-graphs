text: ' No. Cherry blossom honey and comb honey are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. They are different types of honey with distinct characteristics.
  Cherry blossom honey is made from the nectar of cherry blossoms, while comb honey
  is pure honey that includes the wax combs built by honeybees to store their honey.'
