text: ' No. Jamaican Jerk Seasoning and Maggi seasoning cubes are not semantic and
  ontological duplicates. They have different ingredients, flavors, uses, and cultural
  origins. While they both serve to add flavor to food, they belong to distinct categories
  of culinary seasonings with unique characteristics. Merging them as duplicates would
  lead to confusion and incorrect categorization.'
