text: "No. \n\nPeanut oil and sesame oil are two distinct edible oils with their own\
  \ unique nutritional profiles and culinary uses. While they are both vegetable oils,\
  \ they differ in composition, flavor profiles, and health benefits. Merging them\
  \ together as semantic and ontologic duplicates would lose the specific identity\
  \ and uniqueness of each oil."
