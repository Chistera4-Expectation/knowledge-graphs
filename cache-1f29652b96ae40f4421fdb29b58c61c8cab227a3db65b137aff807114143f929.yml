  While both pork fat and pork shoulder come from pigs, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they refer to different parts of the animal with distinct nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking. Pork fat typically refers to rendered pig fat used
  for various culinary purposes, while pork shoulder is a specific cut of meat that
  includes some fat but also has muscle tissue and connective tissues. Therefore,
  these two terms represent unique concepts within the context of a food classification
  system.'
