text: No, the instances 'Enoki Mushroom' and 'Hedgehog Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the
  edible mushroom class, they are distinct species with unique characteristics, nutritional
  profiles, and culinary uses. Merging them would result in a loss of specific information
  and make it difficult to provide accurate dietary advice.
