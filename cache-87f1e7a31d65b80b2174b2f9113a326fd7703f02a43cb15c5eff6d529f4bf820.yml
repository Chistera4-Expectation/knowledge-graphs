text: No, 'Artisanal Water' and 'Soft Water' should not be merged as they refer to
  different types of water with distinct characteristics. Artisanal Water typically
  refers to water sourced from natural springs or wells, while Soft Water refers to
  water with low mineral content, making it ideal for household use and preventing
  scale buildup in appliances. Although both are types of drinking water, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates.
