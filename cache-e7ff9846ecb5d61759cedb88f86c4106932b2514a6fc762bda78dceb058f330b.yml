text: ' No. While pork belly and pork shoulder are both cuts of meat from a pig and
  share some similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of their location
  on the animal, texture, flavor, and culinary uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
