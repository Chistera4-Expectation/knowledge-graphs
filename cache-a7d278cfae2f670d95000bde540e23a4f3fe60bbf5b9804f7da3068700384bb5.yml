text: No, the instances "Chanterelle Mushroom" and "Mushrooms" should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. Chanterelle Mushroom is a specific
  type of mushroom, while "Mushrooms" is a more general term that includes various
  types of fungi. They have distinct characteristics, nutritional values, and uses
  in cooking. Merging them together would lead to a loss of information and clarity
  in the classification.
