text: No, the 'Blewit Mushroom' and 'Maitake Mushroom' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the Edible Mushrooms
  class, they are distinct species with unique characteristics and nutritional properties.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of edible mushrooms and
  their respective qualities.
