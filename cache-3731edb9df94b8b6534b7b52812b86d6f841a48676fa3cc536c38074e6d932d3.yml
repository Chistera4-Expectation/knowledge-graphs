  While kiwi seeds and pomegranate seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles and characteristics that make them unique from one
  another. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Instead, they should each be treated as separate entities
  with their own properties and values within the context of an "Edible Seeds" classification
  system.'
