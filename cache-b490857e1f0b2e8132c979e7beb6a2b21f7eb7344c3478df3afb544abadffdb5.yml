text: No, Corn Oil and Soybean Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates, as they are different types of vegetable oils with distinct nutritional
  profiles, production methods, and uses. While they might share some commonalities
  as edible vegetable oils, they are not interchangeable.
