  While both Blueberry Honey and Comb Honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics that make them different from each other. Blueberry Honey is made
  by bees that gather nectar from blueberry flowers, resulting in a unique flavor
  profile. On the other hand, Comb Honey is honey still contained within its original
  hexagonal wax cells built by honeybees, which provides a distinctive texture and
  taste experience. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  as semantic and ontological duplicates since they refer to separate concepts with
  their own specific attributes and qualities.'
