text: ' Banana leaves are not a food item themselves, but they can be used as wrappers
  or plates in certain cuisines. Therefore, none of the given categories apply to
  them directly. However, if we had to choose one category that is most closely related
  to their use, it would be ''Food Dressing,'' since banana leaves help present and
  serve food items while maintaining their freshness.'
