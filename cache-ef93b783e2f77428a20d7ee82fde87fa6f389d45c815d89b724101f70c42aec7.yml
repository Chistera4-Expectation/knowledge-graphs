text: As a dietician, I can provide guidance on the nutritional aspects of these bread
  types, but I am not qualified to determine semantic and ontologic duplicates in
  a software context. However, from a nutritional perspective, Cuban bread and Multigrain
  bread have different nutritional profiles and are not duplicates. Cuban bread is
  typically made with lard or vegetable shortening, while multigrain bread is made
  with a variety of grains, resulting in a higher fiber content and potentially different
  nutrients.
