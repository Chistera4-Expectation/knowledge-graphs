text: No, Canola Oil and Hazelnut Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Canola oil is primarily used for cooking and has
  a neutral flavor, while Hazelnut oil is typically used for flavoring dishes and
  has a strong, nutty taste. Additionally, their nutritional compositions differ,
  with Hazelnut oil being higher in unsaturated fats and vitamin E than Canola oil.
