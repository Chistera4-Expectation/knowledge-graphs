text: No, the instances 'Pork Cutlet' and 'Pork' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the Pork-derived
  Food class, they represent different specific types of food items. 'Pork' refers
  to the general category of meat derived from pigs, while 'Pork Cutlet' is a specific
  dish made from pork, typically breaded and fried. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the differences between these two food items.
