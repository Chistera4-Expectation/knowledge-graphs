text: No, Fried Egg and Fried Taro Dumplings should not be merged together as they
  are not duplicates. They are different foods with distinct ingredients and preparation
  methods. Fried Egg is made from eggs, while Fried Taro Dumplings are made from taro
  and other ingredients, forming a completely different dish.
