text: ' No. Catfish and stockfish are not semantic or ontological duplicates and should
  not be merged together. They belong to different categories of edible fish with
  distinct characteristics. Catfish is a freshwater fish that can be found all over
  the world, while stockfish is unsalted dried codfish from the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore,
  they have different nutritional profiles, tastes, textures, and cultural significance.'
