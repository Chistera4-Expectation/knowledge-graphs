  While chili powder and curry powder are both used to add flavor to dishes, they
  contain different ingredients and are used in different types of cuisine. Chili
  powder is typically made from ground dried chill peppers and may also include other
  spices such as cumin, garlic, and oregano. It is commonly used in Mexican and Southwestern
  cooking. Curry powder, on the other hand, is a blend of several spices including
  turmeric, coriander, cumin, fenugreek, and chilies. It is an essential ingredient
  in many Indian, Thai, and Malaysian dishes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two concepts as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
