  While both "rice flour" and "short-grain rice" are related to rice, they refer to
  different food products with distinct uses and properties. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Rice flour is made from grinding rice grains into a fine powder, which can then
  be used for various culinary purposes such as baking gluten-free goods, thickening
  sauces, and making noodles. On the other hand, short-grain rice refers to a specific
  type of rice that has a shorter and rounder grain than long-grain rice. Short-grain
  rice tends to have a higher starch content, resulting in stickier texture when cooked,
  making it suitable for dishes like sushi, risotto, and paella.'
