text: "No, B\xE9chamel sauce and Mustard sauce should not be merged as semantic and\
  \ ontological duplicates. While they both belong to the category of sauces, they\
  \ have distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses. B\xE9chamel sauce is a white sauce\
  \ made from a roux of butter and flour, while Mustard sauce typically consists of\
  \ mustard, vinegar, and other seasonings. Merging them would result in a loss of\
  \ specificity and clarity regarding the unique characteristics of each sauce."
