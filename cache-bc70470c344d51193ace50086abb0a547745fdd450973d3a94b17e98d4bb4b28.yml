text: ' No. While both Russian dressing and soy sauce dressing can be used as condiments
  or toppings for food, they are distinct sauces with different ingredients and flavors.
  Russian dressing is typically made from a combination of mayonnaise, ketchup, chili
  sauce, onion, vinegar, and other spices, while soy sauce is a liquid condiment made
  primarily from fermented soybeans and roasted grains. Therefore, they cannot be
  considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
