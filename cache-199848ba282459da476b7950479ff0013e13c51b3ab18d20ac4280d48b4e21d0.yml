  Short-grain rice and sushi rice can often be considered the same thing, as they
  refer to varieties of rice that have short, plump grains. Sushi rice is typically
  a type of short-grain rice that has been seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt,
  making it ideal for use in sushi rolls and other Japanese dishes. However, when
  not specifically prepared as sushi rice, short-grain rice and sushi rice are essentially
  interchangeable terms for the same type of grain. Therefore, from both a semantic
  (meaning) and an ontological (category) perspective, these two instances could reasonably
  be merged as duplicates.'
