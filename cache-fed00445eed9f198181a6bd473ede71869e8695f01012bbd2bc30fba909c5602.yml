text: No, the instances 'Maitake Mushroom' and 'Portobello Mushroom' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types
  of edible mushrooms, they have distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and
  culinary uses. Merging them would result in a loss of specific information and potentially
  lead to confusion.
