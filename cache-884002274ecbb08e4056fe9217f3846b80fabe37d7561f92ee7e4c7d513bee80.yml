text: No, the instances 'Chicken of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Shiitake Mushroom' should
  not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible mushrooms,
  they are different species with distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles,
  and culinary uses. Merging them as duplicates would not accurately represent their
  unique properties.
