text: "As a dietician, I can provide an opinion based on the nutritional content and\
  \ properties of the teas. Assam tea and Green tea are different types of teas with\
  \ distinct nutritional profiles. Assam tea is a black tea from the Assam region\
  \ in India, while Green tea is a type of tea that is minimally oxidized, preserving\
  \ more of its natural antioxidants and nutrients. \n\nWhile they both share some\
  \ common properties, they also have unique characteristics and health benefits.\
  \ Therefore, I would not consider them as semantic and ontologic duplicates. So,\
  \ my answer is no."
