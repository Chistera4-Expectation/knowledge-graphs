text: ' "Beverage" could be the concise class name that encompasses all three options:
  Coffee, Infusion Drink, and Tea. To determine the most adequate option in terms
  of quantity, it would depend on what you mean by "quantity." If you are referring
  to serving size or portion control, then an infusion drink may be the best choice
  as they can often be made in larger quantities and consumed over a more extended
  period compared to coffee or tea. However, if you mean caloric content or caffeine
  levels per serving, then this assessment might change. It is essential to consider
  individual nutritional needs when making decisions about food and drinks.'
