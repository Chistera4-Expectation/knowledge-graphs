text: As a dietician, I would recommend considering the differences between frozen
  yogurt and yogurt in terms of nutritional content, ingredients, and preparation
  methods. While they both originate from the same base ingredient (fermented milk),
  frozen yogurt typically contains added sugar and is served cold, whereas yogurt
  is usually served chilled or at room temperature. Therefore, I would suggest treating
  them as separate instances in a Yogurt class, as they have distinct characteristics
  and uses.
