text: No, the instances 'Flying fish' and 'Monkfish' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they are both fish, they are two
  distinct species with unique characteristics, habitats, and nutritional profiles.
  Merging them would result in a loss of valuable information and would be incorrect
  in terms of taxonomy and classification.
