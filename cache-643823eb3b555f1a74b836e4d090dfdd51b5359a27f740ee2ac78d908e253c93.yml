text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Duck Tenders' and 'Duck
  Thighs' are derived from ducks and fall under the Poultry-derived Food class, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They are distinct cuts of meat with
  different properties, textures, and uses in cooking. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the variety of poultry-derived food options available.
