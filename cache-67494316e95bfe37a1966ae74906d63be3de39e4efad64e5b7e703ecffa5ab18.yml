  While both cooked meat and ground meat are types of prepared beef, they refer to
  different forms of preparation and therefore cannot be considered semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Cooked meat refers to any type of beef that has been heated to a safe
  internal temperature for consumption, while ground meat specifically refers to beef
  that has been chopped into small pieces using a grinder. These two categories serve
  distinct purposes when discussing beef nutrition and food safety.'
