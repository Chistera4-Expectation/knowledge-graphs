text: No, 'Beet juice' and 'Prune juice' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are types of juice, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles, flavors, and health benefits. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the unique characteristics of each type of juice.
