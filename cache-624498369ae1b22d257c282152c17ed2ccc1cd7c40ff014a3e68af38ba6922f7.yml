  While both Heather honey and honey (in general) are types of sweet substances produced
  by bees from nectar, they have distinct characteristics that make them different.
  Heather honey is a specific type of monofloral honey made primarily from the nectar
  of heather plants, while honey can refer to any sweet substance produced by bees
  from various plant sources. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two concepts as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
