# Cache for query: in the Edible Vegetable class, should the instances 'Vegetables of your choice' and 'other vegetables for variation' be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates? yes or no answer only

text: As a dietician, I would recommend keeping both instances separate. Although
  they may seem similar, they serve different purposes. 'Vegetables of your choice'
  implies a personal selection of vegetables, while 'other vegetables for variation'
  suggests incorporating a variety of vegetables to add more flavors and nutrients
  to your diet. Merging them together may lead to confusion for users.
