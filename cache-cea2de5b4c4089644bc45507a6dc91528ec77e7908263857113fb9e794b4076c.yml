text: No, the instances 'Hedgehog Mushroom' and 'Reishi Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are two different species of
  edible mushrooms with distinct characteristics, uses, and nutritional profiles.
  Hedgehog mushrooms are known for their firm texture and nutty flavor, while Reishi
  mushrooms are more commonly used for their medicinal properties and are not typically
  consumed as a culinary ingredient.
