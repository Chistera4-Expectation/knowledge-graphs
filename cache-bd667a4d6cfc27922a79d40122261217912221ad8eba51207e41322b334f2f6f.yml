text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from quail, they are different food products with distinct preparation
  methods and nutritional profiles. Quail Nuggets are likely breaded and fried while
  Quail Soup is a liquid dish with various ingredients, and these differences affect
  their nutritional values and how they can be used in a diet.
