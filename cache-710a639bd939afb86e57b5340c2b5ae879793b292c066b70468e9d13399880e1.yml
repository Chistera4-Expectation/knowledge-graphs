  The term "bread" refers to a general category of baked goods made from flour, water,
  yeast, salt, and sometimes other ingredients. Whole wheat bread, on the other hand,
  is a specific type of bread that is made with whole wheat flour instead of refined
  white flour. While both are types of bread, they have distinct differences in terms
  of nutritional content, taste, and texture. Therefore, it makes sense to keep them
  separate rather than merging them as duplicates.'
