text: Yes, diced tomatoes and tomatoes can be considered semantic and ontological
  duplicates, as they are essentially the same vegetable but in a different form.
  Diced tomatoes are simply tomatoes that have been cut into small pieces. However,
  it's essential to consider that they might have slightly different nutritional values
  due to the cutting process, which may remove some of the nutrients found in the
  skin or seeds.
