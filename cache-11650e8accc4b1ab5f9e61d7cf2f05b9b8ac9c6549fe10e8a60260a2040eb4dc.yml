text: ' No. While red bell peppers are simply mature green bell peppers that have
  turned red due to ripening, they can still be considered distinct from green bell
  peppers because their nutritional profiles change during the ripening process. Red
  bell peppers generally contain higher levels of vitamins A and C compared to green
  bell peppers. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them as separate entities with
  unique properties.'
