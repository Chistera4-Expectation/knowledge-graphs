text: No, the instances 'Horseshoe Crab' and 'Porcelain Crab' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they are both crustaceans,
  they belong to different subclasses and are not considered edible. Horseshoe Crabs
  are not true crabs but are more closely related to spiders and scorpions, while
  Porcelain Crabs are true crabs but are not commonly consumed as food.
