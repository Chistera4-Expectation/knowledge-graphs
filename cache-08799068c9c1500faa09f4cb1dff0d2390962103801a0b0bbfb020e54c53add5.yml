text: ' No. Oyster sauce is a specific type of sauce, so it should not be merged with
  the more general category of sauces. This would result in a loss of important distinctions
  and could lead to confusion. It''s important to maintain clear definitions for each
  concept in order to accurately describe and discuss different types of food and
  their nutritional content.'
