text: ' The most adequate class for short-grain rice would be "Grains." However, since
  "Grains" is not listed in the options provided, I suggest choosing "Rice" as it
  is the closest category. Short-grain rice falls under the Oryza sativa species and
  is characterized by its small kernel size. It has higher starch content compared
  to other types of rice (such as medium or long grain), which results in a sticky
  texture when cooked - making them suitable for various dishes such as sushi, risotto,
  and paella.'
