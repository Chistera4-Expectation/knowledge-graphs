text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both 'Ghee' and 'ghee for cooking' are related to the same concept, they are
  not exact duplicates. 'Ghee' refers to clarified butter, which is a specific type
  of edible vegetable oil, while 'ghee for cooking' is a more general term referring
  to the use of ghee for cooking purposes. The distinction between the two terms is
  important in understanding the context and specific application of ghee in cooking
  and dietary practices.
