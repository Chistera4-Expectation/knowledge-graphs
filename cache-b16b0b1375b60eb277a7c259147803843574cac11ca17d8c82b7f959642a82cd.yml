text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different processed forms of
  turkey meat. Turkey Breast refers to the meat from the breast portion of a turkey,
  while Turkey Nuggets are typically smaller pieces of turkey meat that have been
  breaded and fried. Although both are derived from turkeys, their preparation and
  presentation are distinct.
