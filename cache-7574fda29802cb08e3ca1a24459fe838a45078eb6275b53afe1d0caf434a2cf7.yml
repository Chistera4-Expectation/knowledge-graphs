text: ' "Cereal" would be the most appropriate class name in this case, as it is the
  category that encompasses products specifically designed to be eaten for breakfast.
  Both bread and pasta are typically consumed at other meals, while rice can be consumed
  at any time of day. By choosing "Cereal," you are specifically focusing on breakfast
  options which is what manufacturer produces.'
