text: No, the instances 'Chicken Wings' and 'chicken/vegetable stock' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both involve
  chicken as a main ingredient, they are distinct types of food with different nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking. Chicken Wings are a specific cut of meat, while chicken/vegetable
  stock is a liquid base made by simmering chicken and vegetables in water.
