text: No, they should not be merged. Although they may share some similarities, they
  are distinct types of yogurt with different characteristics and properties. Drinkable
  yogurt typically refers to yogurt with a liquid consistency, while fruit-flavored
  yogurt refers to yogurt with added fruit flavorings and sometimes chunks of fruit.
  These are not semantic or ontologic duplicates, as they represent different categories
  of yogurt products.
