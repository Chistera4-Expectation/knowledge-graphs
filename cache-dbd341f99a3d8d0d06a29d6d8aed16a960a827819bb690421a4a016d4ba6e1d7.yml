text: No, they should not be merged together. Pork Loin and Pork Schnitzel are two
  distinct types of pork-derived food, with different preparation methods and resulting
  textures and flavors. Pork Loin refers to the meat from the back of the pig, typically
  served as a roast or cut into steaks, while Pork Schnitzel is a breaded and fried
  cutlet made from pork loin or another cut of meat, often thinner and with a crispy
  coating.
