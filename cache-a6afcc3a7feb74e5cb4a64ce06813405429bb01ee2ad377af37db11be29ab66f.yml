text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both sesame oil and soybean oil are edible vegetable oils, they have different nutritional
  profiles, flavors, and uses. Sesame oil has a nutty aroma, while soybean oil is
  more neutral in flavor. They can be classified under the same category (edible vegetable
  oils), but they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
