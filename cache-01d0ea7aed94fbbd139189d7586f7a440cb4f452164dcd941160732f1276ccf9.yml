text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both 'Ostrich Tenders' and 'Quail Tenders' are derived from poultry, they are different
  species of birds with distinct nutritional profiles and characteristics. Merging
  them as duplicates would not accurately represent the differences between these
  two food items.
