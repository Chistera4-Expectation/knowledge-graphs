text: ' No. Panko breadcrumbs and white bread are not duplicate entries. They are
  two distinct types of bread with different textures, tastes, and uses in cooking.
  Panko breadcrumbs are Japanese-style breadcrumbs made from crustless white bread
  that has been crumbled into fine breadcrumbs. White bread, on the other hand, refers
  to a type of bread made from refined flour that has been stripped of nutrients and
  fiber. While they share some similarities, they have different characteristics and
  purposes, making them separate entities. Therefore, they should not be merged as
  duplicates.'
