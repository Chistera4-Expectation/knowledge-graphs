text: No, Canola Oil and Corn Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different chemical
  compositions, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Canola Oil is primarily composed
  of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, while Corn Oil has a higher percentage
  of polyunsaturated fats. Additionally, they are derived from different plant sources
  and have distinct flavors.
