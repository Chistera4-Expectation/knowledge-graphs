text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Cow's Milk' and 'Nut Milk'
  are types of milk, they are distinct in their source and nutritional content. 'Cow's
  Milk' comes from cows and is a dairy product, while 'Nut Milk' is derived from nuts
  and is a plant-based alternative to dairy milk. Merging them would obscure these
  important differences.
