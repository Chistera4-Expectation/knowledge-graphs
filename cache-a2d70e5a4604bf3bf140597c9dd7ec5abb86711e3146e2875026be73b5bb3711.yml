text: No, Almond Milk and Pea Milk should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of plant-based milk alternatives. They differ in their nutritional content,
  taste, and source ingredients. Although both are non-dairy milk alternatives, their
  unique properties and characteristics should be preserved in the classification
  system.
