text: No, Beef shank and Beef should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both are types of beef, they refer to different cuts of meat with distinct
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Merging them would lead to loss of important
  information about the differences between these two types of beef.
