text: ' No, corned beef and grass-fed beef are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They refer to different types of beef products
  with distinct preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Corned beef is beef
  that has been preserved through a process of salt curing, while grass-fed beef refers
  to how the cattle were raised before they were slaughtered. While both may have
  some similarities in terms of their macronutrient content (protein, fat, etc.),
  there can still be significant differences in other aspects such as sodium content
  (for corned beef) and omega-3 fatty acid content (grass-fed beef). Therefore, it
  is important to maintain separate entries for each type of beef product.'
