text: ' No. While green onions (also known as scallions) are indeed a type of vegetable
  that is often used in salads and other dishes, they do not belong to the same category
  as "other leafy greens" such as spinach, kale, and collard greens. Green onions
  are actually part of the allium family, which also includes garlic, shallots, leeks,
  and chives. They have a long, slender stem with a small white bulb at the base and
  dark green leaves on top. Leafy greens, on the other hand, are characterized by
  their broad, flat leaves and include many different types of vegetables that vary
  in taste, texture, and nutritional content. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two categories as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
