text: No, Argan Oil and Peanut Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different properties,
  sources, and uses. Argan Oil is derived from the kernels of the argan tree, native
  to Morocco, and is known for its rich, nutty flavor and use in both cooking and
  cosmetics. Peanut Oil, on the other hand, is extracted from peanuts and has a mild,
  nutty flavor, making it popular for cooking and frying. Merging these two oils as
  duplicates would disregard their unique characteristics and uses.
