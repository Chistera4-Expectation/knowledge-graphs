  While both chicken broth and chicken nuggets are derived from chickens and contain
  poultry, they serve different culinary purposes and have unique nutritional profiles.
  Chicken broth is primarily a liquid made by simmering chicken parts with vegetables
  and seasonings, often used for cooking or consumed as a light meal or snack. It
  tends to be lower in calories and fat compared to chicken nuggets. On the other
  hand, chicken nuggets are bite-sized pieces of breaded and fried (or baked) chicken
  meat, usually higher in calories, fat, and sodium due to their preparation methods.
  Merging these two instances would not accurately reflect their distinct identities
  within the context of poultry-derived foods.'
