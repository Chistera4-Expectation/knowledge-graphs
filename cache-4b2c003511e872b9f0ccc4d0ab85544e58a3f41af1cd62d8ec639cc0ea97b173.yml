  While both diced onions and scallions are types of edible vegetables and can be
  used in similar ways (e.g., as flavoring or garnish), they have distinct differences
  in taste, appearance, and culinary uses that make them non-duplicate entities. Diced
  onions come from bulb onion varieties such as yellow, white, or red onions, while
  scallions are immature green onions with long, thin green leaves and small white
  bulbs at the base. The flavors, textures, and applications for each vegetable differ
  significantly enough to warrant separate categorization.'
