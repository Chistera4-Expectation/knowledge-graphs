text: No, "Infused Water" and "Sparkling Water" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of water, they have distinct differences
  in terms of flavor, production methods, and ingredients. Infused water typically
  contains added fruits, herbs, or other natural flavors, while sparkling water is
  carbonated and may or may not have added flavors.
