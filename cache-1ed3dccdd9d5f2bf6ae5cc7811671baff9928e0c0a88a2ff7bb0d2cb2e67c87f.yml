  While eggplant and eggplants refer to the same vegetable (Solanum melongena), it
  is common practice to use "eggplant" when referring to one unit of the vegetable
  and "eggplants" when referring to multiple units. Therefore, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates but rather different forms of expression for singular
  and plural quantities of the same entity. Merging them would result in incorrect
  usage in certain contexts.'
