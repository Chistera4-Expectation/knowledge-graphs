text: No, 'Salted Butter' and 'Whipped Butter' should not be merged together as they
  have distinct properties. Salted Butter contains added salt, while Whipped Butter
  has been aerated to increase its volume and create a lighter texture. These differences
  impact taste, usage, and nutritional content, making them separate entities in a
  dietary context.
