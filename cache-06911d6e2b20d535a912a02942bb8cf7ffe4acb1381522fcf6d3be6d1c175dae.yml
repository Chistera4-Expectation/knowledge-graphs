text: ' "Game Meats" would be the most appropriate class on its own, as it is a distinct
  category of meat that includes various types of wild game such as venison, bison,
  and rabbit. Other classes listed like "Beef," "Meat," "Pork-derived Food," and "Poultry-derived
  Food" are more specific types or subcategories of meat.'
