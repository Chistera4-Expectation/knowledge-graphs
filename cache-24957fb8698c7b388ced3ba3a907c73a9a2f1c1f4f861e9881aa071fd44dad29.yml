text: ' No. Green peas and snow peas are related but they have distinct nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses, so they should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They belong to the same family (Leguminosae) and genus (Pisum), but
  they are different species: Pisum sativum for green peas and Pisum sativum var.
  saccharatum for snow peas. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them as separate
  entities in an edible vegetable class.'
