text: No, Chili oil and Hazelnut oil should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of edible vegetable oils with different properties, uses, and nutritional
  values. Chili oil is made from chili peppers and has a spicy flavor, while Hazelnut
  oil is made from hazelnuts and has a nutty flavor. Merging them would result in
  a loss of important information and would not accurately represent the variety of
  edible vegetable oils.
