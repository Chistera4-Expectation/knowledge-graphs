text: ' ''Edible Vegetables'' would be the most appropriate class for ''Herbs.'' Although
  herbs are often used as seasonings and may not always be consumed in large quantities
  like other vegetables, they share similar nutritional properties and benefits. Additionally,
  grouping them with breads, cereals, pastas, oils, or specific types of food items
  might not accurately represent their role in a balanced diet.'
