text: No, Avocado Oil and Corn Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they have different nutritional
  profiles, chemical compositions, and uses in cooking and food preparation. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each oil.
