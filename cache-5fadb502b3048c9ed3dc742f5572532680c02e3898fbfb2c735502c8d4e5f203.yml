text: ' No. Avocado oil and rice bran oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of edible vegetable oils. They come from different plant
  sources (avocados vs. rice grains), have distinct nutritional profiles, and various
  culinary uses. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate instances
  within the context of an edible vegetable oil class.'
