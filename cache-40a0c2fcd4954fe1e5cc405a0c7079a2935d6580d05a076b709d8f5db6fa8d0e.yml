text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from ducks,
  they are distinct food items with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses.
  Duck Gizzards are a specific part of the duck, while Duck Soup is a dish that can
  be made with various duck parts, including gizzards, and other ingredients. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the different food items in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
