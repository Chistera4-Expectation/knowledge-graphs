text: No, these instances should not be merged as they represent different types of
  sauces with distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses. Enchilada sauce is a traditional
  Mexican sauce made from chili peppers, while Scotch bonnet pepper sauce is a Caribbean
  sauce made from Scotch bonnet peppers. Although they are both sauces, they have
  different characteristics and serve different purposes.
