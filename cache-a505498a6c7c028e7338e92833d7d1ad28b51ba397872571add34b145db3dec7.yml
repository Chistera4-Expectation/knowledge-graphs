text: No, these instances should not be merged together as they are different food
  items derived from the same animal (guinea fowl). Guinea Fowl Drumsticks refer to
  the meaty leg portion, while Guinea Fowl Stock refers to a liquid broth made from
  simmering guinea fowl bones, meat, and vegetables. They have different nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses, so they should remain separate instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
