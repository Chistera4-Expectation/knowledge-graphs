text: No, Herbal Tea and Pu-erh Tea should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of tea with different properties and health benefits. Herbal tea refers to
  infusions made from various herbs, fruits, and spices, while Pu-erh tea is a type
  of fermented tea originating from China. Both can be considered under the broader
  category of tea, but they should not be merged as duplicates.
