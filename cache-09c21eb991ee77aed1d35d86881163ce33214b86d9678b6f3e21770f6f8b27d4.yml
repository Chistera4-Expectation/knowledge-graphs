  While both "walnut oil" and "palm nut soup base" are types of edible vegetable oils,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come from different sources
  (walnuts vs. palm nuts), have different culinary uses (oil for cooking vs. soup
  base with various ingredients), and likely differ in their nutrition profiles as
  well. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
