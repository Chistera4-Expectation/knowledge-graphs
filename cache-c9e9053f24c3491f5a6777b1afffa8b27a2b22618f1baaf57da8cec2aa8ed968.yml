text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both instances are related
  to water, they serve different purposes in the context of the Drinking Water class.
  Purified Water refers to water that has been treated to remove impurities and contaminants,
  making it safe for drinking. On the other hand, Water for egg wash is used in cooking,
  specifically for brushing egg wash (a mixture of beaten egg and water or milk) onto
  pastry dough before baking, which helps to achieve a golden-brown crust and better
  adhesion for toppings. Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
