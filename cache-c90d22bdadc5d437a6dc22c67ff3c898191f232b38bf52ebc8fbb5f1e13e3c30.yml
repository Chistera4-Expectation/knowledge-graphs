text: No, "Pheasant Eggs" and "Pheasant Gizzards" should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from poultry (pheasants), they
  represent different parts of the pheasant and have different nutritional profiles
  and uses in cooking. Pheasant Eggs are an egg product, while Pheasant Gizzards are
  a type of organ meat.
