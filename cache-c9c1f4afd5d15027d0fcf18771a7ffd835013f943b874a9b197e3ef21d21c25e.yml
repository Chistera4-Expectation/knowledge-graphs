text: No, these two instances should not be merged together as they serve different
  purposes and have distinct properties. "Flavored Water" refers to water with added
  flavors, while "Water for egg wash" refers to water used for coating food items
  before baking or frying. Although they both involve water, their uses and characteristics
  are different.
