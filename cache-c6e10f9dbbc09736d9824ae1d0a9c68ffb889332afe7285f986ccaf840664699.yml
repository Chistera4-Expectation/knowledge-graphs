text: No, Pumpkin Seed Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct properties, nutritional values, and uses. Merging them would disregard
  their unique characteristics and would not accurately represent the variety of edible
  vegetable oils available.
