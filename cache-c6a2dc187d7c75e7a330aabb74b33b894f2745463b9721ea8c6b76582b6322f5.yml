text: ' No. Grapeseed oil and olive oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. While both are types of edible vegetable
  oils, they come from different plants (grapes vs olives) and have unique nutritional
  profiles, flavors, and uses in cooking and food preparation. Therefore, it is important
  to maintain them as separate entities with their own distinct properties.'
