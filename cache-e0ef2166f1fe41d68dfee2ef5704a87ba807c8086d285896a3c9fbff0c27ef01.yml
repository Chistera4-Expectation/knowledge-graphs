text: No, Chanterelle Mushroom and Cremini Mushroom should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of edible mushrooms, they have
  distinct characteristics, flavors, and uses in cooking. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the unique qualities of each mushroom variety.
