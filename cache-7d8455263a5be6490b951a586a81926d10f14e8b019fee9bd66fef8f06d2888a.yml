text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Crab meat and Mitten Crab
  are edible crustaceans, they are different types of crabs with distinct characteristics
  and properties. Crab meat is a general term referring to the meat from various crab
  species, whereas Mitten Crab specifically refers to a freshwater crab species. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate instances in the Edible Crustaceans class.
