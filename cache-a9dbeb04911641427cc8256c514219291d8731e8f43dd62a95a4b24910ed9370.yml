text: ' The most adequate class for soy sauce would be "Food Seasoning." Soy sauce
  is primarily used as a condiment or seasoning to add flavor to various dishes, rather
  than serving as the main component of a meal. It is not an alcoholic drink, meat
  product (such as beef, pork-derived food, or poultry-derived food), grain (like
  bread, rice, pasta types, or breakfast cereal), dairy product (milk, butter, cheese,
  yogurt), sweetener, or beverage (juice, coffee, tea, energy drink). Instead, it
  belongs in the category of ingredients that enhance and elevate the taste of other
  foods, making "Food Seasoning" the best fit.'
