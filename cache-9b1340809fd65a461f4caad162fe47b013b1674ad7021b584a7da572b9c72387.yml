text: ' Drinking Water


  Infused water is simply water that has been flavored with herbs, fruits, vegetables,
  or other natural ingredients. While there are many beverage options available, infused
  water is the most appropriate choice when considering it from a nutritional standpoint
  as it provides hydration without adding any significant calories, sugar, caffeine,
  alcohol, or artificial additives to your diet.'
