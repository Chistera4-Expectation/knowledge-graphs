text: No, Hedgehog Mushroom (Hydnum repandum) and Portobello Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus)
  should not be merged together as they are different species of mushrooms with distinct
  characteristics, appearances, and nutritional profiles. Although both are edible
  mushrooms, they belong to different genera and should be treated as separate entities
  in a classification system.
