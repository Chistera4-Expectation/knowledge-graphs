  While both Sichuan peppercorns and chili bean paste are used as seasonings in cooking
  and can add flavor to dishes, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  are distinct ingredients with unique flavors, textures, and uses in recipes.


  Sichuan peppercorns are actually the dried berries of a type of prickly ash shrub
  that is native to China. They have a numbing effect on the mouth due to their active
  component, sanshool. Chili bean paste, also known as doubanjiang, is a fermented
  sauce made from broad beans, soybeans, salt, rice, and various spices including
  chilies. It has a savory, salty, and slightly sweet taste with a spicy kick from
  the chilies.


  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two ingredients as duplicates.'
