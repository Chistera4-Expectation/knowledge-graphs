text: ' No. While red onions and yellow onions are similar in that they are both types
  of vegetables and specific varieties of onions, they have distinct differences in
  terms of their taste, appearance, and nutritional content. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. Red onions tend
  to be milder in flavor with a crisp texture and contain higher levels of antioxidants
  compared to yellow onions, which generally have a stronger flavor and a more subtle
  color. Keeping these distinctions clear is important for accurate culinary and nutritional
  purposes.'
