text: 'As a dietician, I can provide a general answer, but it''s essential to consider
  the specific ingredients and properties of the teas in question.


  In terms of semantics, if ''Blueberry Lavender Infusion'' and ''Lavender Tea'' both
  consist solely of blueberries and lavender, they could be considered semantic duplicates.


  However, for ontology, if ''Blueberry Lavender Infusion'' includes other ingredients
  or has a different preparation method, it could be considered a distinct entity.


  Therefore, the answer is: It depends on the specific ingredients and properties
  of the teas.'
