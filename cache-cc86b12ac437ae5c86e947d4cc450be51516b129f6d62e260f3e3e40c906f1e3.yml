text: ' No. While "Cooked Seafood" is a type of "Seafood," they are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates because they represent different stages in the processing
  and preparation of edible fish. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions
  between raw and cooked forms of various seafood items.'
