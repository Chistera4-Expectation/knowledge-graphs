text: As a dietician, I would suggest that these two instances should not be merged
  together. While they both involve water, they have different uses and purposes in
  the context of cooking and dietetics. Rainwater is typically used for drinking or
  other purposes, while water for egg wash is used specifically for coating food items
  before baking or frying. They are not semantic or ontological duplicates in this
  context.
