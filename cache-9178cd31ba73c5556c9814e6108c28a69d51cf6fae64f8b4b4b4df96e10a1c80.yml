text: No, the instances 'Green bell pepper' and 'habanero peppers' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of peppers,
  they have distinct characteristics, uses, and levels of spiciness. Green bell peppers
  are mild and typically used in salads or as a vegetable, while habanero peppers
  are extremely spicy and often used in hot sauces or for adding heat to dishes. They
  should be treated as separate entities in the Edible Vegetable class.
