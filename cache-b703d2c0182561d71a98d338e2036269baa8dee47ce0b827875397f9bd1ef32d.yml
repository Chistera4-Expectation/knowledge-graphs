text: No, they should not be merged. While both are poultry-derived foods, they are
  distinct and unique products with different nutritional profiles and uses. Duck
  liver is a type of organ meat, while duck tenders are a cut of muscle meat. They
  should be treated as separate entities in a dietician's classification system.
