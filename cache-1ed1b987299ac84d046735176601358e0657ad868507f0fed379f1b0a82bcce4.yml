  The base ingredient of the sauce and toppings of your choice are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates, as they refer to different components of the overall dish
  or meal that includes a sauce.


  The base ingredient of the sauce refers to the primary component used in creating
  the sauce itself, such as tomatoes for marinara sauce or cream for alfredo sauce.
  This is distinct from any additional ingredients that may be added later on, such
  as herbs or spices, which can enhance the flavor of the sauce but do not constitute
  its core.


  On the other hand, toppings are typically added after the sauce has been prepared
  and applied to a food item, such as pasta or meat. Toppings can include items like
  cheese, vegetables, meats, or breadcrumbs, among others, and serve to add texture,
  taste, and visual appeal to the finished dish.


  Therefore, while both the base ingredient of the sauce and toppings contribute to
  the overall taste and presentation of a dish, they represent separate entities with
  unique functions within the context of cooking and culinary arts.'
