text: As a dietician, my answer would be no, they should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both quail meat and quail tenders are
  derived from quails, they are different cuts of the bird. Quail meat can refer to
  the entire bird or a mix of different cuts, while quail tenders specifically refer
  to the tenderloin portion of the bird. These are distinct in terms of their nutritional
  content, culinary uses, and cooking methods. Therefore, they should be treated as
  separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
