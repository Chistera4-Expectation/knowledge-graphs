text: No, the instances 'Pheasant Meatballs' and 'Pheasant Thighs' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different preparations of
  poultry-derived food, with distinct ingredients, nutritional profiles, and cooking
  methods. While they both involve pheasant meat, the specific parts used and the
  form they take make them separate food items.
