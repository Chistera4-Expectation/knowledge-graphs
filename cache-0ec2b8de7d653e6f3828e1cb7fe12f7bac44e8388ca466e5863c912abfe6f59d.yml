  The amount of sugar in the juice per serving and specifying tomato juice as needed
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they represent different types
  of information about the juice. The first refers to a nutritional aspect (sugar
  content) of any type of juice, while the second is a specific ingredient choice
  for making the juice. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two
  pieces of information into one.'
