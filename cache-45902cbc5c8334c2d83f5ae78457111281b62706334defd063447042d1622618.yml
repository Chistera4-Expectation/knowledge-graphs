text: "As a dietician, my primary concern is with the nutritional content and potential\
  \ health implications of various sauces. From a nutritional standpoint, Beurre Blanc\
  \ sauce and Hollandaise sauce are quite different. Beurre Blanc is an emulsified\
  \ sauce made from a reduction of vinegar and/or white wine, with butter added. Hollandaise\
  \ sauce is also an emulsified sauce, but it is made from egg yolks, melted butter,\
  \ and lemon juice.\n\nFrom a semantic and ontological standpoint, they are not exact\
  \ duplicates, as they are made using different ingredients and have distinct flavor\
  \ profiles. However, they do share similarities as emulsified sauces that can be\
  \ high in fat and calories, which could be considered in their classification. \n\
  \nIn summary, while Beurre Blanc sauce and Hollandaise sauce are not identical,\
  \ they are related in terms of their status as emulsified sauces and their potential\
  \ nutritional impact. However, I would not recommend merging them together as semantic\
  \ and ontological duplicates."
