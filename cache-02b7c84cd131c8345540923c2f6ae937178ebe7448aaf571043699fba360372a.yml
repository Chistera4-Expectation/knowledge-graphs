text: No, the instances 'Pumpernickel Bread' and 'White Bread' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of bread, they
  have distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. Pumpernickel bread is typically
  darker, denser, and made from rye flour, while white bread is lighter in color,
  fluffier, and made from refined wheat flour. These differences make them separate
  entities in terms of dietetics and nutrition.
