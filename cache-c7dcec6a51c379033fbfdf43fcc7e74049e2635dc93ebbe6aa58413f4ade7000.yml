text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different food products derived
  from ostriches. Ostrich gizzards are a type of meat, while ostrich stock is a liquid
  prepared by simmering ostrich bones, meat, and/or vegetables. Although they are
  related, they have distinct properties and uses in cooking.
