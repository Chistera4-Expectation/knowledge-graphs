text: No, Quail Gravy and Quail should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although they both come from quail, they are different food items with distinct
  nutritional profiles and uses in a meal. Quail is the meat, while Quail Gravy is
  a sauce made from the drippings and other ingredients.
