text: No, they should not be merged. While both are types of milk, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles and characteristics. Nut milk is a plant-based alternative
  to dairy milk, often made from almonds, soybeans, or other nuts, and typically has
  lower fat and protein content than whole milk. Whole milk, on the other hand, is
  a dairy product derived from cows and contains higher fat and protein content. These
  differences in nutritional composition and origin make them distinct entities in
  a dietary context.
