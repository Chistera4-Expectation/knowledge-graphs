text: ' "Cheese" would be the most appropriate class for Ricotta cheese out of the
  given options. This is because Ricotta is a type of cheese, made from whey that
  is left over after making other cheeses. While Butter, Milk, and Yogurt are dairy
  products like Cheese, they do not belong to the same category as Ricotta.'
