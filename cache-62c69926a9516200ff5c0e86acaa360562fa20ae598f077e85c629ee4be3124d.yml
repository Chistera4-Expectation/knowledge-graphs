text: ' No. Corn oil and flaxseed oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While they are both types of edible vegetable
  oils, they have different nutritional profiles, uses, and sources. For example,
  corn oil is higher in saturated fats compared to flaxseed oil which has a high concentration
  of omega-3 fatty acids. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between these
  two oils when providing information about their nutrition and use.'
