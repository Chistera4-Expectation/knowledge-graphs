  While both "cooked white rice" and "rice paper wrappers" are made from rice, they
  have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Cooked white rice is high
  in carbohydrates and calories but has little fiber or protein, while rice paper
  wrappers are low in calories, fat, and carbs, with virtually no fiber or protein.
  Additionally, cooked white rice is typically used as a main ingredient or side dish,
  whereas rice paper wrappers are primarily used to make wraps, rolls, and other dishes
  where they serve more of a structural role rather than being the primary source
  of nutrition. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
