text: No, Macadamia Nut Oil and Pistachio Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils derived from nuts,
  they have distinct properties, nutritional values, and uses in cooking. Merging
  them together would not accurately represent their individual characteristics.
