text: No, Enoki mushrooms and Morel mushrooms should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible mushrooms, they are distinct
  species with different appearances, tastes, and culinary uses. Enoki mushrooms (Flammulina
  velutipes) have long, thin stems and small caps, while morel mushrooms (Morchella
  spp.) have a distinctive honeycomb-like cap. They are not the same and should not
  be merged together.
