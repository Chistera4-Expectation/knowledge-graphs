text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct food items with
  different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. "Pork Sausage" is a processed
  food made from ground pork, while "Pork Shoulder" is a cut of meat from the shoulder
  of the pig. Although they both come from the same animal, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
