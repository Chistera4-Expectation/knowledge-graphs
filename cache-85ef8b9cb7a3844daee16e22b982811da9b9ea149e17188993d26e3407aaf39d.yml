text: 'No, "Duck Soup" and "Guinea Fowl Soup" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the Poultry-derived Food
  class and are soups, they are made from different types of poultry: duck and guinea
  fowl, respectively. Each has its unique ingredients, flavors, and nutritional profiles.
  Therefore, they should be treated as distinct entities in the Poultry-derived Food
  class.'
