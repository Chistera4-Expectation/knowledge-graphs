  The decision to merge classes in object-oriented programming, such as "Sauce" and
  "Sauces," is not based solely on whether they are semantic or ontological duplicates,
  but also considers other factors like their functionality, usage, and design principles.


  In this case, even if "Sauce" and "Sauces" might have similar meanings (semantically),
  they usually serve different purposes in code:


  1. A single ''Sauce'' instance could represent an individual sauce type (e.g., Tomato
  Sauce).

  2. The ''Sauces'' collection or list would contain multiple ''Sauce'' instances,
  allowing you to manage and manipulate groups of sauces efficiently.


  Therefore, it is generally recommended to keep them separate for better organization,
  maintainability, and adherence to best practices in software development.'
