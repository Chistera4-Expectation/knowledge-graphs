text: No, Flaxseed Oil and Rice Bran Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Flaxseed Oil is rich in omega-3
  fatty acids, while Rice Bran Oil contains a balanced amount of omega-3, omega-6,
  and omega-9 fatty acids, as well as vitamin E and antioxidants. Merging them would
  not accurately represent their unique characteristics and uses in the dietary context.
