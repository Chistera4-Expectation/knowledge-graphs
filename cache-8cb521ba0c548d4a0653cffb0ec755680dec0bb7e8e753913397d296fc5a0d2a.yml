text: As a dietician, I am not qualified to make decisions about animal breed classifications.
  However, based on general knowledge, 'Belted Galloway' and 'Galloway' are distinct
  breeds with differences in appearance and history, despite sharing some similarities.
  Therefore, it is not accurate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  The correct answer would be 'no'.
