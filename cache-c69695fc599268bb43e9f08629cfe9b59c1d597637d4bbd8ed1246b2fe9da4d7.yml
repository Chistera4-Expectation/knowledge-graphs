text: ' No. While scotch bonnet peppers and habanero peppers are similar in terms
  of heat level (both are very spicy), they have distinct flavors and appearances.
  Scotch bonnets tend to be more rounded and slightly sweeter with a fruity undertone,
  while habaneros are more elongated and have a slightly more bitter flavor profile.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
