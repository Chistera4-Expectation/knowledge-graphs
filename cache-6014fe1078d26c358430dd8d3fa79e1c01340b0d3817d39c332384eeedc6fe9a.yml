text: No, they should not be merged together. While they both involve beef, they are
  different cuts and have different uses in cooking. 'Beef cubed steak' is a cut of
  beef that is tenderized and cubed for stews or other slow-cooking methods, while
  'beef patties' are formed into flat, round shapes for grilling or pan-frying as
  a burger patty.
