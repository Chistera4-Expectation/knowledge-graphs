  While soybean oil and sunflower oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct properties and uses that make them unique from one another. Soybean
  oil is high in polyunsaturated fats, while sunflower oil has a higher proportion
  of monounsaturated fats. Additionally, each oil has its own flavor profile and smoke
  point, which can affect their suitability for different cooking methods. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
