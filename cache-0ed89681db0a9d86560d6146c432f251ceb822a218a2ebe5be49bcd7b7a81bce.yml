text: ' No. In object-oriented programming, where classes and objects are defined,
  "Coffee" (with a capital C) typically refers to the class, which is a blueprint
  for creating objects that represent individual coffees. On the other hand, "the
  coffee" (with a definite article) would refer to an individual instance of the Coffee
  class, representing a specific cup or serving of coffee. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates since they have
  different meanings and purposes within the context of object-oriented programming.'
