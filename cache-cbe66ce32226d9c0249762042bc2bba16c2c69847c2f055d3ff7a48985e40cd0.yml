text: ' No. Long-grain rice and rice paper wrappers are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They belong to different categories of food products with distinct uses
  and nutritional profiles. While long-grain rice is a type of grain used for various
  dishes such as pilafs and stir-fries, rice paper wrappers are thin sheets made from
  rice flour and water that are commonly used in Asian cuisine to make spring rolls
  and wraps.'
