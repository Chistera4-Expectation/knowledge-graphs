text: No, Blueberry Honey and Sage Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have distinct
  flavors and properties due to the different plants their bees primarily gather nectar
  from (blueberries and sage, respectively). Merging them would not accurately represent
  the differences between the two types of honey.
