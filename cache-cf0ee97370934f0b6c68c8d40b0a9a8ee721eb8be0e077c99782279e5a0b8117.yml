text: ' No. Almond milk and condensed milk are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. These two types of milk have different nutritional
  profiles and uses. Almond milk is made from almonds and water, while condensed milk
  is made by heating milk to remove some of its water content and then adding sugar.
  As such, almond milk is often lower in calories and fat than condensed milk. Additionally,
  these products serve different purposes: almond milk is commonly used as a dairy-free
  alternative for drinking or using in recipes, while condensed milk is typically
  used as an ingredient in baking and cooking.'
