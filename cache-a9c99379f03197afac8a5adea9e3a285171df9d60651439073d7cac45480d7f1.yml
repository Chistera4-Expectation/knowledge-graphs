text: ' Based on the given options, I would classify "Ice Cream" as a "Dairy Product".
  This is because ice cream is typically made from milk and cream, which are dairy
  products. While there may be some variations that use alternative ingredients (such
  as coconut milk or soy milk), these varieties would still fall under the broader
  category of plant-based or non-dairy alternatives to traditional ice cream, rather
  than fundamentally changing its classification as a type of dessert made with a
  frozen base.'
