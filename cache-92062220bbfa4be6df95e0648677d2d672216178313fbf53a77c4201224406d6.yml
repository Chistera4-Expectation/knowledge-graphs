text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although both chicken soup and turkey soup are derived from poultry and belong to
  the same food class, they are not duplicates. They have different ingredients, nutritional
  profiles, and cultural significance, making them distinct instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
