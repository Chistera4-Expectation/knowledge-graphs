text: ' No. Feta cheese is a specific type of cheese that falls under the broader
  category of cheese. While they are related concepts, they are not duplicates because
  they represent different levels of abstraction within the hierarchy of cheese types.
  Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions between specific cheese
  varieties and general categories.'
