text: ' No. While Scotch bonnet peppers and habanero peppers are similar in terms
  of heat level (both are very spicy), they have distinct flavors and appearances
  that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
