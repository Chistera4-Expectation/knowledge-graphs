  I can provide some insight on the classification of drinking water.


  Spring water and water are not exactly semantic and ontological duplicates, as they
  have distinct properties and origins. Spring water refers to water that naturally
  flows from an underground aquifer to the Earth''s surface, typically through a natural
  spring. This water often contains minerals and is believed to have a better taste
  due to its natural filtration process. On the other hand, water is a broader term
  that encompasses any type of water, including tap water, bottled water, and spring
  water. While spring water falls under the category of water, the term ''water''
  is more general and does not specify the source or properties of the water. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
