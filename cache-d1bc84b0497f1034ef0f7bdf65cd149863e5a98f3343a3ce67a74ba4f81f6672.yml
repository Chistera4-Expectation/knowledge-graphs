text: No, 'Duck Drumsticks' and 'Duck Wings' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both parts of a duck, they have distinct
  characteristics in terms of nutritional content, taste, and culinary applications.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between the two.
