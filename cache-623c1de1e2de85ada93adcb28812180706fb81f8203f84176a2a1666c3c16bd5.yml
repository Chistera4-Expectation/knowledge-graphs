  While soybean oil is a type of vegetable oil, not all vegetable oils are made from
  soybeans. Other common types of vegetable oils include canola oil, olive oil, corn
  oil, sunflower oil, and many others. Therefore, it would not be accurate to merge
  "soybean oil" and "vegetable oil" as semantic and ontological duplicates since they
  do not have exactly the same meaning and refer to different sets of items.'
