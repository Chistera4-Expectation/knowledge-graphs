  While both Piri Piri sauce and Tomato sauce can be classified under the broader
  category of "sauces," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they
  have distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. Piri Piri sauce is typically
  made with bird''s eye chilies, garlic, onion, citrus peel, vinegar, salt, and oil,
  while tomato sauce usually consists of tomatoes, garlic, onions, olive oil, herbs,
  and spices. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
