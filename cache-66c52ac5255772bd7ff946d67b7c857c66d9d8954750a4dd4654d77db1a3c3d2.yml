text: ' No. Fresh cilantro (also known as coriander leaves) and fresh ginger are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. They belong to different plant families: Cilantro
  is from Apiaceae family while Ginger belongs to Zingiberaceae family. Although they
  can have similar appearances when used as herbs, their tastes, textures, uses, and
  nutritional profiles differ significantly. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as duplicates.'
