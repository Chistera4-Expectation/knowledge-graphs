text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of onions. Fried onions
  refer to onions that have been cooked in oil, while red onions are a specific variety
  of onions with a reddish-purple skin and white flesh. They may have some similarities,
  but they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
