text: ' "Insectivore" would be the most appropriate concise class name for an organism
  that primarily consumes scorpions. This is because insects, arachnids (which include
  scorpions), and other small invertebrates make up the majority of their diet. However,
  it''s worth noting that not all animals that eat scorpions are exclusively insectivores,
  as some may also consume other types of food.'
