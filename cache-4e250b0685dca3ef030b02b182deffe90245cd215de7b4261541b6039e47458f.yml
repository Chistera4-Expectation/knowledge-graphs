  While cayenne pepper and white pepper may have some similarities, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Cayenne pepper is made from ground dried red chili peppers
  and has a hot, spicy flavor, while white pepper comes from fully ripened fruit that
  has had its outer skin (and heat) removed, resulting in a milder taste. Therefore,
  these two ingredients serve different purposes in cooking and recipes, making them
  distinct entities in terms of both their meaning and categorization within food
  and nutrition taxonomies.'
