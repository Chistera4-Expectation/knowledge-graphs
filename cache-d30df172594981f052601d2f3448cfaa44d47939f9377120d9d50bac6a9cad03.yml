text: No, Andouille sausage and Pork sausage should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from pork, they have different
  flavors, textures, and ingredients, making them distinct types of sausage. Andouille
  sausage, for example, typically contains a higher amount of seasoning, including
  garlic and paprika, and is smoked, whereas pork sausage can have a variety of flavors
  and can be fresh or smoked.
