text: No, these instances should not be merged together as they are different types
  of poultry-derived foods. Guinea Fowl Meat refers to the meat from guinea fowl,
  while Ostrich Meatballs refer to a specific dish made with ostrich meat. Although
  they are both poultry-derived, they have different characteristics and uses in a
  culinary context.
