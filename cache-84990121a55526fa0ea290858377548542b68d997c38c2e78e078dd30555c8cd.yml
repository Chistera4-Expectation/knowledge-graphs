  While both "pickled ginger" and "pickles" are pickled vegetables, they are different
  in terms of their nutritional content, flavor, and culinary uses. Pickled ginger
  is typically served as a side dish or used as a condiment, while pickles are often
  used as a topping for sandwiches or salads. Additionally, pickled ginger is made
  from thin slices of fresh ginger that have been pickled in vinegar, sugar, and spices,
  whereas pickles are made from cucumbers that have been preserved in brine or vinegar.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
