text: No, Buckwheat Honey and Sunflower Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the Honey class, they are
  distinct types of honey with different flavors, nutritional profiles, and origins.
  Merging them would result in loss of information and specificity.
