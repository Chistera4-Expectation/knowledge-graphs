  Although both are types of yogurt, they differ in flavor and preparation methods.
  Fruit-flavored yogurt typically contains fruit puree or flavorings, while Lassi
  yogurt is a traditional Indian drink made by blending yogurt with water, spices,
  and sometimes fruit. These differences in composition and usage warrant separate
  instances in the Yogurt class.
