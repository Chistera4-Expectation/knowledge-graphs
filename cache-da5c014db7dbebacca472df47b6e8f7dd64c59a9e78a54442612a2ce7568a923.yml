text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of sauces, they have
  distinct characteristics and uses due to their ingredients and flavor profiles.
  Marinara sauce is a tomato-based sauce with Italian origins, while Scotch bonnet
  pepper sauce is a spicy sauce made from a specific type of pepper, originating in
  the Caribbean. These differences make them unique entities in terms of semantics
  and ontology.
