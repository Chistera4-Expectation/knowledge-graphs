text: No, Ceylon Tea and Lavender Tea should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of tea, they have distinct properties,
  origins, and flavors. Ceylon Tea comes from the Sri Lankan highlands, while Lavender
  Tea is infused with lavender flowers, creating a different taste and aroma profile.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent the unique characteristics
  of each type of tea.
