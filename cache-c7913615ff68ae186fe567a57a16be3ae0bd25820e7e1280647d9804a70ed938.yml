  Coconut water and mineral water have distinct properties, nutritional content, and
  origins. Coconut water is the liquid found inside young, green coconuts, while mineral
  water is naturally occurring water from a mineral spring that contains various minerals.
  While both are types of drinking water, they serve different purposes and provide
  different nutrients.
