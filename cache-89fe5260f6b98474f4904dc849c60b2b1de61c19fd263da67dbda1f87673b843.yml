  * **Anti-inflammatory properties:** Pomegranate extract has anti-inflammatory effects
  that can help reduce inflammation throughout the body.

  * **Antibacterial properties:** Pomegranate extract has antibacterial properties
  that can help fight infections.

  * **Anticancer properties:** Pomegranate extract has been shown to have anticancer
  properties, particularly against breast, colon, and leukemia cancer cells.

  * **Heart health:** Pomegranate extract can help improve heart health by reducing
  inflammation and improving blood flow.

  * **Diabetes control:** Pomegranate extract can help improve blood sugar levels
  and insulin sensitivity.

  * **Cognitive function:** Pomegranate extract has been shown to improve cognitive
  function and memory.


  **Coffee** and **Tea** are also sources of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.
  However, they contain caffeine, which can have negative effects on health, such
  as jitteriness, anxiety, and insomnia. Pomegranate extract does not contain caffeine,
  making it a more appropriate choice for individuals who are sensitive to caffeine
  or who are taking medications that interact with caffeine.


  Therefore, based on its overall health benefits, Pomegranate Pomegranate is the
  most adequate class among Coffee and Tea for a dietician.'
