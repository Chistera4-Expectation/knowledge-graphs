text: ' The most appropriate category for "Leavening Agents" would be "Food Seasoning."
  Leavening agents are substances used to create gas in doughs and batters, causing
  baked goods to rise. While they may not fit the traditional definition of seasonings
  (which usually refer to herbs or spices), leaveners still serve as an essential
  component in enhancing the flavor profile of certain foods.'
