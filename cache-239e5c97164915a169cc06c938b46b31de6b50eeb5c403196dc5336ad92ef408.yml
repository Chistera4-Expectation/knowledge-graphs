  The terms "cooking" and "jasmine" describe different characteristics of rice, with
  "cooked rice" referring to the cooking process and "jasmine rice" referring to a
  specific type of rice grain. These two concepts are not synonymous, so they should
  not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
