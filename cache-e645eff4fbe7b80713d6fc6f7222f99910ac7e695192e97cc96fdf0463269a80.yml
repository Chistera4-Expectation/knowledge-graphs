text: No, Amaranth Seeds and Kiwi Seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are seeds, they are distinct from each
  other in terms of their nutritional content, plant species, and culinary uses. Merging
  them would result in a loss of valuable information.
