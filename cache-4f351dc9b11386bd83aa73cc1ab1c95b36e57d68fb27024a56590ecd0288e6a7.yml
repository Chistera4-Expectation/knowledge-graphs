text: No, Lavender Honey and Sourwood Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have distinct characteristics
  and flavors derived from the specific flowers their bees gather nectar from (lavender
  and sourwood, respectively). They are different types of honey, not duplicates.
