text: No, they should not be merged together. "Pickled vegetables" and "vegetable
  stock" are two different food items with distinct preparation methods, nutritional
  profiles, and uses in cooking. They may both contain vegetables, but their classification
  as "edible vegetable" is not sufficient to consider them as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates.
