text: No, they should not be merged as they have different characteristics, nutritional
  values, and levels of spiciness. Red bell peppers are sweet and mild, while habanero
  peppers are extremely spicy. They belong to the same class of vegetables (edible
  vegetables), but they are distinct and serve different purposes in recipes and dietary
  needs.
