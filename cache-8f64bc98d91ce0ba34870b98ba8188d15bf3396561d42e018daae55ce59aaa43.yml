text: No, the instances 'Hen of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Velvet Pioppini Mushroom'
  should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they
  share some similarities, they are different species of mushrooms with distinct characteristics,
  appearance, and culinary uses. Hen of the Woods (Grifola frondosa) is a large, fan-shaped
  mushroom with a woody texture, while Velvet Pioppini (Agrocybe aegerita) is a smaller,
  velvety mushroom with a more delicate texture. These distinctions are important
  in the context of dietary information and nutritional values.
