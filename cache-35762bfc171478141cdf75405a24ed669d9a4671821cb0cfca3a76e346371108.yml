text: ' No. Although both "Lasagna noodles" and "Rice noodles" may fall under the
  general category of "pasta," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  have distinct characteristics, ingredients, and uses in cooking. Lasagna noodles
  are typically wide, flat sheets made from wheat flour and eggs, used in layered
  dishes like lasagna. Rice noodles, on the other hand, are often thin, translucent
  noodles made from rice flour, commonly found in Asian cuisine. Merging them would
  result in loss of specificity and could lead to confusion about their unique properties.'
