text: As a dietician, I am not an expert in water chemistry or ontology. However,
  in general, "Hard Water" and "Water" are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Hard water refers to water with a high mineral content, specifically calcium and
  magnesium ions, while water in general refers to the liquid substance that is essential
  for life. These two terms are related but distinct concepts.
