  While cooked white rice and long-grain rice can refer to similar types of rice,
  they are not exactly the same thing. Long-grain rice is a type of rice that has
  a longer shape than other types such as short-grain or medium-grain rice. Cooked
  white rice refers to any type of rice that has been cooked and stripped of its husk,
  which results in it becoming white. Therefore, while long-grain rice may result
  in cooked white rice after being prepared, the two terms do not have identical meanings
  and should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
