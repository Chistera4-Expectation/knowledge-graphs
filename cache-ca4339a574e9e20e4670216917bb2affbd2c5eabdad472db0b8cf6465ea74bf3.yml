text: No, Acacia Honey and Lavender Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both types of honey, they have distinct properties and
  characteristics that differentiate them from each other. Merging them would not
  accurately represent the unique qualities of each type of honey.
