text: No, the instances 'Pork Sausage' and 'Pork Shank' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from pork, they are
  distinct cuts and types of pork products with different uses, textures, and flavors.
  Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and clarity in describing pork-derived
  foods.
