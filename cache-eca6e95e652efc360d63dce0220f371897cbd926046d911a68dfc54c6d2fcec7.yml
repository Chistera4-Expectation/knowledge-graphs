text: ' No. While "cheese" and "category of cheese" may seem similar, they have different
  meanings and uses within a domain of cheese classification. A single instance of
  "cheese" (e.g., Cheddar) is not equivalent to a "category of cheese" (e.g., blue-veined
  cheeses). Merging them would lead to confusion and loss of essential distinctions
  between individual cheese types and broader categories.'
