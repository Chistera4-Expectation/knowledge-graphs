text: ' I cannot definitively determine the most adequate class for aluminum salts
  without additional context, as they can be used in various roles within food production.
  However, based on common usage, "Food Additive" could be a suitable and inclusive
  category for aluminum salts (as well as other additives) that encompasses dressings,
  seasonings, sauces, spices, and sweeteners.'
