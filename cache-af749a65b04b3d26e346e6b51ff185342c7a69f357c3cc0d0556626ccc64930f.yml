text: No, Oat Milk and Whole Milk should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  They are different types of milk with distinct nutritional profiles and production
  methods. Oat Milk is a plant-based milk alternative made from oats, while Whole
  Milk is an animal-based product derived from cows. They serve different dietary
  needs and preferences, and therefore, should be treated as separate entities in
  the Milk class.
