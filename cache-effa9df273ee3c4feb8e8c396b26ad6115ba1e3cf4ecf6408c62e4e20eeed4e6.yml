text: " No.\n\nThe two instances are not identical in terms of their physical form\
  \ (whole vs. sliced) and spiciness level (jalape\xF1os are spicy, while red bell\
  \ peppers are mild). These differences may impact their usage and preparation in\
  \ various dishes, making them distinct entities in the context of culinary applications.\
  \ Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates."
