  While canola oil and pumpkin seed oil are both edible vegetable oils, they come
  from different plants and have unique nutritional profiles. Canola oil is derived
  from rapeseed, while pumpkin seed oil comes from the seeds of certain pumpkin varieties.
  As such, merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates would not accurately
  reflect their distinct properties and uses.'
