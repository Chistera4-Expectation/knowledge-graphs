text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are alcoholic drinks, they
  have distinct characteristics, uses, and cultural significance. Dry white wine is
  a type of wine made from white grapes, while Shaoxing wine is a Chinese rice wine
  with its own unique flavor profile and cultural importance. These differences make
  them separate entities in the context of an Alcoholic Drink class.
