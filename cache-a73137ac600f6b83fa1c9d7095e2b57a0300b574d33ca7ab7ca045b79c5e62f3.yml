  While both ''Beef'' and ''Grain-finished beef'' are types of cattle meat, they refer
  to different production methods that can impact the nutritional profile, taste,
  and texture of the final product. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate
  for accurate categorization and labeling purposes. Merging these terms would not
  accurately reflect their distinct characteristics and qualities.'
