text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Sushi-grade fish and Swordfish
  are types of edible fish, they are distinct entities with different characteristics,
  uses, and potential considerations for dietary restrictions or health concerns.
  Sushi-grade fish refers to fish that is safe to eat raw and is typically used in
  sushi and sashimi dishes, while Swordfish is a specific type of fish with its own
  unique nutritional profile and potential for mercury contamination.
