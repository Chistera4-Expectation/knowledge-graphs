  While both fresh raw fish and dry fish are types of edible fish, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their properties and uses, making them separate concepts
  from a semantic and ontological perspective. Fresh raw fish is unprocessed and typically
  consumed soon after being caught, while dry fish has been preserved through processes
  such as sun-drying or smoking, altering its texture, taste, and nutritional content
  significantly. Therefore, merging these two instances would not accurately represent
  their unique characteristics.'
