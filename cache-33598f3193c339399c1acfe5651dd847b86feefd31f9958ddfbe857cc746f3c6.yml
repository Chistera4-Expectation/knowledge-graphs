text: As a dietician, I can provide input on the nutritional aspects of tea but not
  on semantic and ontologic duplicates. From a dietary perspective, Ceylon Tea and
  Darjeeling Tea are different types of tea, and merging them would not be appropriate.
  Ceylon Tea is grown in Sri Lanka, while Darjeeling Tea is grown in India. They have
  different flavor profiles and may have slightly different nutritional properties.
  However, the decision to merge them as semantic and ontologic duplicates should
  be made by someone with expertise in those areas.
