text: No, they should not be merged. While both are types of butter, they have distinct
  differences in terms of production and nutritional content. Cultured butter is made
  from fermented cream, while light butter has a reduced fat content compared to regular
  butter. These differences make them separate entities in the context of dietary
  and culinary applications.
