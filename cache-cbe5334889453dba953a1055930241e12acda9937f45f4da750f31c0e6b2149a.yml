text: ' No. Corn oil and safflower oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they may share some similar properties as edible vegetable oils. They
  come from different plant sources (corn vs. safflower), have distinct compositions,
  and possess unique nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is important to maintain
  them as separate entities within the classification system for accurate representation
  of their differences.'
