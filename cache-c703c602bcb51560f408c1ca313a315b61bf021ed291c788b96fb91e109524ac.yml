text: "No.\n\nBread and Whole Wheat Bread are not semantic and ontologic duplicates,\
  \ even though they are related concepts. \n\n**Semantic Duplicates:**\nTwo terms\
  \ are semantic duplicates if they have the same meaning and are used in the same\
  \ way in discourse. In this sense, \"Bread\" and \"Whole Wheat Bread\" are not semantic\
  \ duplicates, as they have different meanings:\n- Bread is a general term used to\
  \ refer to any baked good made from flour, water, and yeast.\n- Whole Wheat Bread\
  \ is a specific type of bread made from whole wheat flour, which is a type of grain.\n\
  \n**Ontological Duplicates:**\nTwo terms are ontological duplicates if they represent\
  \ the same object or concept in a knowledge base. In this sense, \"Bread\" and \"\
  Whole Wheat Bread\" are not ontological duplicates, as they represent different\
  \ objects in the knowledge base:\n- Bread is a concept or object that represents\
  \ a baked good made from flour, water, and yeast.\n- Whole Wheat Bread is a concept\
  \ or object that represents a specific type of bread made from whole wheat flour."
