  Crimini mushrooms are a specific type of mushroom that belongs to the species Agaricus
  bisporus, while "mushrooms" is a general term that encompasses many different types
  of fungi. While they share some similarities in terms of their nutritional profile
  and culinary uses, they have distinct differences in terms of their flavor, texture,
  and appearance. Therefore, it would not be accurate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.'
