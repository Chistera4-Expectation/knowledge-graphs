  While chia seeds and pumpkin seeds can both be classified under the broader category
  of "edible seeds," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct
  nutritional profiles, textures, tastes, and uses in cooking and baking, among other
  differences. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them as separate instances within
  the Edible Seeds class.'
