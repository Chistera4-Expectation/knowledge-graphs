text: ' No. Diced celery and diced hard-boiled egg are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates because they refer to two distinct types of food that have different
  nutritional profiles and uses in recipes. While both can be used as ingredients
  for various dishes, their physical properties, taste, texture, and nutrient content
  differ significantly. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate in any
  classification system.'
