text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both are derived from ducks, they are different types of food products with distinct
  characteristics, preparation methods, and nutritional values. Duck meatballs are
  typically a ground mixture of duck meat, seasonings, and sometimes breadcrumbs or
  other binders, shaped into balls and cooked, often by baking, frying, or grilling.
  Duck thighs, on the other hand, are a specific cut of meat from the duck's leg,
  and they can be prepared in various ways, such as roasting, grilling, or braising.
