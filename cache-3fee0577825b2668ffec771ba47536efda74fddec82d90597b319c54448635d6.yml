text: ' No. Jasmine rice and long-grain rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While both are types of rice, they have distinct
  characteristics that make them unique. Jasmine rice is a type of long-grain rice
  that has a distinctive aroma and sticky texture when cooked, while other varieties
  of long-grain rice do not have this aroma and have a drier texture. Therefore, it
  is important to keep these two terms separate to maintain accuracy and clarity in
  communication about different types of rice.'
