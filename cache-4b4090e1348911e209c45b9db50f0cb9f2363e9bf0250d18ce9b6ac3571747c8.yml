text: No, Amaranth Seeds and Poppy Seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of edible seeds, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, uses, and appearances. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the differences between these two seeds.
