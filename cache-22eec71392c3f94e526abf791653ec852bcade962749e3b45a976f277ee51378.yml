text: ' No. Creamed honey and fireweed honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. They refer to different types of honey with distinct characteristics.
  Creamed honey is honey that has been processed to create a smooth, spreadable texture,
  while fireweed honey is honey made from the nectar of fireweed flowers and has a
  unique flavor profile.'
