  While peanut oil and palm oil may share some similarities as types of edible vegetable
  oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come from different
  plants (peanuts vs. palm fruit), have unique nutritional profiles, and distinct
  uses in cooking and industry. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate
  entities with their own specific properties and characteristics.'
