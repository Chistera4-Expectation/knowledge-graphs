text: ' No. While sunflower oil is a type of vegetable oil (since it is derived from
  plants), not all vegetable oils are sunflower oil. Therefore, they cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates. They each refer to specific subsets of edible
  oils with distinct properties and uses.'
