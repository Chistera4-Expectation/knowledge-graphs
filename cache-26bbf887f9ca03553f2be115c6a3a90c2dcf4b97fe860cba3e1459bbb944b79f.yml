  While both ground pork and pork shoulder come from pigs and share some similarities,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different culinary uses,
  nutritional profiles, and physical properties due to their distinct cuts of meat.
  Therefore, it is important to keep them separate for accurate food classification
  and information purposes.'
