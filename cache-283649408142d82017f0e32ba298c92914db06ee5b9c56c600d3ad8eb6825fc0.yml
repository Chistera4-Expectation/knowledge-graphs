  While both Greek yogurt dressing and ranch dressing can be used as toppings for
  salads, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates of each other. They have
  different ingredients, flavors, textures, nutritional profiles, and preparation
  methods. Therefore, it is important to keep them separate and distinct within the
  Food Dressing class.'
