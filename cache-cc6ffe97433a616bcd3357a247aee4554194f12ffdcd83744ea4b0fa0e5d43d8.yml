text: ' No, Buckwheat honey and Strawberry honey should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of honey, they come from different
  flower sources (buckwheat flowers vs strawberries) which gives them distinct flavor
  profiles, colors, and nutritional properties. Therefore, it is important to maintain
  these distinctions when considering their classification within a hierarchical structure
  such as an ontology.'
