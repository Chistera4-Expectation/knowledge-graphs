  While both sodium phosphates and sodium are related to each other chemically (with
  sodium being an element found in sodium phosphates), they serve different functions
  when it comes to food seasoning. Sodium is primarily used as a flavor enhancer and
  preservative, while sodium phosphates have various uses such as emulsifying agents,
  thickeners, and pH regulators. Therefore, they cannot be considered as semantic
  or ontological duplicates in the context of food seasoning.'
