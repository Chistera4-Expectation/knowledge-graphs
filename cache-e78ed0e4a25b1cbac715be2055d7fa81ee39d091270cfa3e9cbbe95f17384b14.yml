text: ' No. While short-grain rice and white rice can sometimes refer to the same
  type of rice (such as pearl white rice), they are not always interchangeable terms.
  Short-grain rice refers specifically to rice grains that are shorter and wider than
  other types of rice, such as medium-grain or long-grain rice. White rice, on the
  other hand, is simply rice that has been milled and had its bran and germ removed,
  resulting in a white color. Therefore, there may be cases where short-grain rice
  is not white, and vice versa. Additionally, different varieties of short-grain and
  white rice have unique nutritional profiles and culinary uses, so it is important
  to maintain them as separate entities in a knowledge graph or database related to
  food and nutrition.'
