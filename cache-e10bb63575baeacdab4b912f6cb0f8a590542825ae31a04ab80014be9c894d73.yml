text: 'No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics: ''Fat-Free Yogurt''
  refers to yogurt with no fat content, while ''Vegan Yogurt'' refers to yogurt made
  without any animal products. These differences in composition and ingredients make
  them separate entities in the yogurt class.'
