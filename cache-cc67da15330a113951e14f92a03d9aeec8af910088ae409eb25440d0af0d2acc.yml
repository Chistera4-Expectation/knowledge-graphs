text: No, "Guinea Fowl Gizzards" and "Pheasant Gizzards" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both gizzards derived from
  poultry, they come from different bird species. Each species may have unique nutritional
  profiles, preparation methods, and flavor profiles, which warrant separate consideration
  in a dietician's perspective.
