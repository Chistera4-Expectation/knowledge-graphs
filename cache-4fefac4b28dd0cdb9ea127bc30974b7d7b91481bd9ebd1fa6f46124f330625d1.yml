text: No, "Duck Drumsticks" and "Duck Thighs" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from ducks and are parts of the
  animal, they are distinct cuts of meat with different nutritional compositions and
  cooking properties. Merging them together would not accurately represent the differences
  between the two.
