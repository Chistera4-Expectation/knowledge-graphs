  While cocktails can be made with various ingredients, they are primarily associated
  with alcohol. Therefore, the most suitable and concise class name would be "Alcoholic
  Drink." This category includes all mixed drinks containing alcohol as their base
  ingredient, which is fitting for cocktails.'
