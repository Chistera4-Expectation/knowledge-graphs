  While poppy seed dressing and tahini dressing may both fall under the category of
  "food dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantically,
  they have different meanings and refer to distinct types of salad dressings with
  unique ingredients and flavors. Ontologically, they belong to separate categories
  within the broader classification system for food items. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
