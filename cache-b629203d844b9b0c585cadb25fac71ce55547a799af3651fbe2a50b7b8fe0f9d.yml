text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are dairy products, they
  have distinct characteristics and uses. Heavy cream is a high-fat dairy product
  primarily used in cooking and baking, while ice cream is a frozen dessert made from
  a mixture of dairy products, sugar, and flavorings. They serve different purposes
  and should be treated as separate entities in a classification system.
