text: ' No. Avocado oil and flaxseed oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils. They come
  from different plants (avocados vs. flaxseeds), have distinct nutritional profiles,
  and serve various culinary purposes. Therefore, it is essential to maintain separate
  records for them to provide accurate information about their unique properties and
  uses.'
