  While both Poppy Seed Dressing and Sesame Ginger Dressing are types of food dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients and flavor profiles. Therefore, it would not be accurate
  to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. Each type of dressing has its
  unique characteristics that contribute to different tastes and uses in various dishes.'
