text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of yogurt with
  distinct characteristics and cultural origins. Bulgarian Yogurt refers to a specific
  type of yogurt traditionally made with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus
  thermophilus bacteria, while Plain Yogurt can refer to any unsweetened yogurt made
  from milk fermented with specific bacterial cultures.
