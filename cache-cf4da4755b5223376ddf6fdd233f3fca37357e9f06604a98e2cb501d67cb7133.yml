text: ' No. Mascarpone cheese and Parmesan cheese are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, and they should not be merged together. Although both are types of cheese,
  they have different nutritional profiles, textures, flavors, production methods,
  uses, and cultural significance. Therefore, it is important to keep them separate
  when discussing or categorizing cheeses from a dietary perspective.'
