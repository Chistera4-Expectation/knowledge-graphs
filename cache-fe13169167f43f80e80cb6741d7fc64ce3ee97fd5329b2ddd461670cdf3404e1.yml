text: No, coconut water and hydrogen water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are liquids, they have distinct chemical
  compositions, properties, and uses. Coconut water is the clear liquid found inside
  young, green coconuts, while hydrogen water is regular water that has been infused
  with additional hydrogen molecules. They are different in their nature, and merging
  them together would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
