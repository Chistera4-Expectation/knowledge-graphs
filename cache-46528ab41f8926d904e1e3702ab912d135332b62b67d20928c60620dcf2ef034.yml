text: No, these instances should not be merged. While they both involve beef, they
  are different types of beef products with distinct preparation methods and nutritional
  profiles. Corned beef is brined or cured, while thinly sliced beef is simply sliced
  thinly and can be cooked in various ways. Merging them would not accurately represent
  the differences in these foods.
