text: No, 'Electrolyte Water' and 'Flavored Water' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they
  serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Electrolyte water contains
  minerals like sodium, potassium, and magnesium to help replace electrolytes lost
  during exercise or in hot weather, whereas flavored water typically contains natural
  or artificial flavors without electrolytes.
