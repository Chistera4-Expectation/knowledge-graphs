  While both "Bread" and "Panko breadcrumbs" are made from bread, they have different
  textures, purposes, and nutritional profiles. Panko breadcrumbs are crispy and airy,
  making them ideal for breading and crusting, while regular bread is denser and better
  suited for sandwiches, toast, and other applications where a softer texture is desired.
  Additionally, Panko breadcrumbs typically contain more calories and fat than regular
  bread due to their higher surface area and added seasonings. Therefore, it''s appropriate
  to keep them separate in the Bread class.'
