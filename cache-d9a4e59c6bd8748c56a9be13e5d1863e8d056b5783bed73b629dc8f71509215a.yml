text: 'No, distilled water and hydrogen water are not the same and should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates.


  Distilled water is water that has been boiled and then the steam condensed back
  into liquid form, leaving behind impurities. It is essentially pure water with no
  minerals or additives.


  Hydrogen water, on the hand, is water that has been infused with hydrogen gas (H2).
  It is believed to have antioxidant properties and potential health benefits, though
  the evidence is still limited and inconclusive. Hydrogen water is not the same as
  distilled water and contains additional elements (hydrogen gas) that are not found
  in distilled water.'
