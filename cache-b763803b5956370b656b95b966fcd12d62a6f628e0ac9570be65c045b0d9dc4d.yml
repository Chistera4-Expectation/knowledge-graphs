text: No, these two instances should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although both are types of pepper, they have distinct characteristics and flavors.
  Dried Cameroon pepper is a type of chili pepper, while Sichuan peppercorns come
  from a different plant species and have a numbing sensation in addition to their
  spiciness. They are not semantically or ontologically equivalent, and maintaining
  separate instances allows for a more accurate representation of the spices and their
  unique properties.
