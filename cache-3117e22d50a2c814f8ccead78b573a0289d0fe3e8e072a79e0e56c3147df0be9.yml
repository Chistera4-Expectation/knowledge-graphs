text: ' No. While evaporated milk is a type of milk that has been concentrated through
  evaporation, it undergoes a distinct processing method that results in differences
  in taste, nutritional content, and usage compared to regular milk. Therefore, they
  should not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
