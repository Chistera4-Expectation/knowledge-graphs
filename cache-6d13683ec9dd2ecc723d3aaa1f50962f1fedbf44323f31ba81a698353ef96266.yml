  While both Eucalyptus honey and regular honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their source (the type of plant nectar they are made from)
  and flavor profile. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Keeping these separate allows for more accurate categorization
  and differentiation between various kinds of honey.'
