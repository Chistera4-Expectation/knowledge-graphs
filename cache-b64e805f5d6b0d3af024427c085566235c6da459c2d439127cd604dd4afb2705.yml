text: As a dietician, I would say that 'Drinkable Yogurt' and 'Plain Yogurt' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are distinct
  types of yogurt with different characteristics. Drinkable yogurt is typically thinner
  and can be consumed directly from a container, while plain yogurt has a thicker
  consistency and is often used as a base for recipes or served with fruit and granola.
  While they share some similarities, they have unique properties that make them different
  products.
