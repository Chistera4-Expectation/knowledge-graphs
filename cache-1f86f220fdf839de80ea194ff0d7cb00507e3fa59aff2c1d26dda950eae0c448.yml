text: No, Enoki mushrooms and Reishi mushroom should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are two distinct types of edible mushrooms with
  different nutritional properties, appearances, and uses. Enoki mushrooms are known
  for their long, thin stems and small caps, while Reishi mushrooms have a woody,
  fan-like appearance. They also have different health benefits and culinary applications.
