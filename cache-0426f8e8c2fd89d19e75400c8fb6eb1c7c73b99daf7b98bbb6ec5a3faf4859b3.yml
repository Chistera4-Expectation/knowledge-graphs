text: As a dietician, I can provide an answer from a culinary and nutritional perspective.
  While Parmesan and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are similar in taste and nutritional
  content, they are not exactly the same. Parmigiano-Reggiano is a specific type of
  Parmesan cheese that is made in a particular region of Italy, following strict guidelines.
  This makes Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese a more traditional and high-quality product
  compared to Parmesan cheese, which can be produced in other regions and may not
  adhere to the same standards. So, from a culinary and nutritional standpoint, they
  should not be considered as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
