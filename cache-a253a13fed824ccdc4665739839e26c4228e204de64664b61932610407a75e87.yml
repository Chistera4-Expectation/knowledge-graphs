  While corn oil is a type of vegetable oil (since it is derived from plants), not
  all vegetable oils are made from corn. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Other examples of vegetable oils include olive oil,
  soybean oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, etc., which have different nutritional profiles
  and uses compared to corn oil.'
