  While chipotle mayo is a type of mayonnaise that contains added ingredients such
  as chipotle peppers for flavor, it does not mean they are semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They have different taste profiles and uses in recipes. Merging them
  would result in loss of specificity and could lead to confusion when providing nutritional
  information or recommendations related to these distinct condiments.'
