  The term "vegetables" refers to various plant-based foods, such as leafy greens,
  root vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, etc., that are typically consumed for their
  nutritional value and flavor. On the other hand, "vegetable broth" is a liquid preparation
  made by simmering vegetables, herbs, and sometimes bones in water, which is often
  used as a base for soups, stews, and sauces. While both terms relate to vegetables,
  they represent different concepts and have distinct culinary uses, making them not
  exact synonyms or duplicates. Therefore, it''s appropriate to keep them separate.'
