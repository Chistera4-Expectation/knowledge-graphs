  While both Blue Cheese Dressing and Greek Yogurt Dressing are types of salad dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients, flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. Doing
  so would disregard their unique characteristics and potential health benefits or
  drawbacks. As a result, maintaining separate entities for these two dressings allows
  for more accurate nutrition information and recommendations tailored to individual
  preferences and needs.'
