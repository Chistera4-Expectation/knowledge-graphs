text: ' No. Arborio rice and rice flour are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. They are two different types of rice products
  with distinct uses and properties in cooking. Arborio rice is a type of Italian
  short-grain rice that is commonly used in risotto dishes due to its high starch
  content, while rice flour is made from grinding rice into a fine powder and is often
  used as a gluten-free alternative to wheat flour for baking and thickening purposes.'
