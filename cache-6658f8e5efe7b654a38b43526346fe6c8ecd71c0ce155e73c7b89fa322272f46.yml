text: No, "Duck Nuggets" and "Turkey Nuggets" should not be merged together as they
  are distinct types of poultry-derived food. While they are both nuggets made from
  different types of poultry, they have unique nutritional profiles, flavors, and
  possibly even textures. Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and potentially
  cause confusion.
