  Extra virgin olive oil and palm oil are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of edible vegetable oils. They have different nutritional
  profiles, origins, tastes, uses, and impacts on health and environment. Therefore,
  it is important to maintain them as separate entries with distinct characteristics.'
