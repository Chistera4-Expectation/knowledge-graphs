  The instance ": The base ingredient of the sauce" refers to a general concept that
  can apply to any type of sauce, while "Piri Piri sauce" is a specific type of sauce
  with its own unique set of ingredients and characteristics. Therefore, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates and should remain separate instances.'
