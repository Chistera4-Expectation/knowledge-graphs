text: No, Salt and Sea salt should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although they share similarities, they have distinct properties that differentiate
  them. Salt is typically harvested from underground deposits and evaporated sea water,
  while Sea salt is specifically harvested from evaporated seawater. Additionally,
  Sea salt may contain trace minerals and elements from the ocean, which can impact
  its flavor and texture, making it different from regular salt.
