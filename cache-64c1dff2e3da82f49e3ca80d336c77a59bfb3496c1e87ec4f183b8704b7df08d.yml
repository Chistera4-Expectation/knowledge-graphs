text: ' No. Red wine and Shaoxing wine are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. While both are types of wine, red wine is
  typically made from dark-colored grape varieties and consumed as an alcoholic beverage,
  while Shaoxing wine is a type of Chinese rice wine with a unique flavor profile
  that is used primarily for cooking rather than drinking. Therefore, these two wines
  have distinct properties and uses, making them separate classes within the Alcoholic
  Drinks category.'
