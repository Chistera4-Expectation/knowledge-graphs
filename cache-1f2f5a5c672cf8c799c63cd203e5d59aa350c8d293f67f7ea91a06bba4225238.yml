  The two instances are not duplicates as they have different names, ingredients,
  and nutritional profiles. Marinara sauce is low in calories and high in vitamins
  A, while Worcestershire sauce has a different flavor profile and may contain added
  sugars, preservatives, and other ingredients that make it less healthy than marinara
  sauce. From a culinary perspective, these sauces serve different purposes and cannot
  be used interchangeably in recipes. Therefore, they should not be merged as duplicates.'
