text: No, the instances 'Breadcrumbs' and 'Ciabatta Bread' should not be merged together.
  While they are both related to bread, they represent different types of bread products
  and should be treated as separate instances. Merging them would lead to confusion
  and a loss of information about each specific type of bread.
