text: ' No. Low-sodium chicken broth and turkey are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both are poultry-derived foods, they have different properties and uses. Low-sodium
  chicken broth is a liquid made from simmering chicken parts and vegetables, while
  turkey refers to a type of bird that is commonly consumed as meat. Turkey can come
  in various forms such as whole roasted birds, ground meat, deli slices, etc., which
  differ in nutritional content and preparation methods compared to low-sodium chicken
  broth.'
