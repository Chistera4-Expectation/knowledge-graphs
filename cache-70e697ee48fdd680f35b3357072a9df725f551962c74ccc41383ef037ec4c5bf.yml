  While both 'Pork Tenderloin' and 'Roast Pork' are derived from pork, they represent
  different cuts and cooking methods. Pork tenderloin is a leaner cut typically cooked
  quickly at high heat, while roast pork refers to a larger cut that is usually cooked
  slowly at low heat. They have distinct nutritional profiles and preparation methods,
  so they should not be considered as duplicates.
