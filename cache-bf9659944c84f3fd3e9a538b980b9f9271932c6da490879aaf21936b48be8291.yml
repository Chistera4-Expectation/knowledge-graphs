text: ' No. Mozzarella cheese is a specific type of cheese, so it cannot be considered
  a duplicate of the more general term "name of the cheese." Additionally, from a
  semantic standpoint, these two terms have different meanings and serve distinct
  purposes in communication. Merging them would not accurately reflect their relationship
  within the domain of cheeses.'
