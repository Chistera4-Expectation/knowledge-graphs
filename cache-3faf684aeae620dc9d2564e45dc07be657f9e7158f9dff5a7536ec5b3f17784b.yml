text: No, 'Chicken Tenders' and 'Quail Tenders' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they both share the term 'tenders,' they are different
  types of poultry-derived food, with chicken and quail being distinct species. The
  nutritional content and preparation methods may also differ, so they should be treated
  as separate instances in a poultry-derived food class.
