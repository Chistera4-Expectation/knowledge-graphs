text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are sauces, they have distinct
  ingredients, flavors, and uses. Piri Piri sauce is a spicy sauce made from chili
  peppers, while Tartar sauce is a creamy sauce typically made with mayonnaise, pickles,
  and capers. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between
  these two sauces.
