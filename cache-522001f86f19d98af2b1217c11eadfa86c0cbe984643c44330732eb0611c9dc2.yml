  While both minced garlic and pickled ginger are types of food seasonings, they have
  different ingredients, flavors, uses, and preparation methods. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. Minced garlic
  is simply chopped or ground raw garlic, while pickled ginger (also known as gari)
  is made by soaking thin slices of young ginger in a vinegar-based marinade. These
  two ingredients serve distinct purposes in cooking and provide unique flavor profiles.'
