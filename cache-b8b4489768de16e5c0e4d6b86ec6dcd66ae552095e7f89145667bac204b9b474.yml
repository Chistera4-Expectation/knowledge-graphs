text: No, Glutinous Rice and Wild Rice should not be merged as they are distinct types
  of rice with different characteristics. Glutinous Rice is a type of short-grain
  rice that is sticky when cooked, while Wild Rice is a long-grain rice that is not
  sticky and has a nutty flavor. They have different nutritional profiles and uses
  in cooking.
