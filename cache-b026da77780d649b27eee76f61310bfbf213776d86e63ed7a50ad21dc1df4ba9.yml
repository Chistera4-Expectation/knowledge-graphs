text: No. Bell peppers and wonton wrappers are different types of edible vegetables.
  Bell peppers are a fruit from the capsicum family, while wonton wrappers are made
  from wheat or rice flour and used in Chinese cuisine. They do not represent the
  same type of vegetable and should not be merged as semantic or ontologic duplicates.
