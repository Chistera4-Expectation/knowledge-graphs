text: No, 'Ostrich Nuggets' and 'Pheasant Nuggets' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both poultry-derived food,
  they are derived from different species of birds and may have different nutritional
  profiles, cooking methods, and cultural significance. Therefore, they should be
  considered as distinct instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
