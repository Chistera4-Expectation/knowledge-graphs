  While both are derived from chicken, they differ in terms of their cuts, preparation,
  and presentation. Chicken breast refers to the lean, boneless, and skinless cut
  from the bird's chest, while chicken patties are typically ground chicken formed
  into a patty shape. These differences in attributes and processing make them distinct
  food items in the poultry-derived food class.
