text: ' No. Alfalfa honey and blackberry honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They come from different
  plant sources (alfalfa flowers vs blackberry plants) which gives them distinct flavor
  profiles, color, and nutritional content. Therefore, it is important to keep them
  separate.'
