text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both safflower oil and sesame
  oil are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles,
  and flavors. Safflower oil is a light-tasting oil with a high smoke point, while
  sesame oil has a nutty aroma and a lower smoke point. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the unique properties of each oil.
