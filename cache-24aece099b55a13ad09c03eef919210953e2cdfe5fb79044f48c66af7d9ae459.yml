text: ' No. While both Blue Cheese Dressing and Olive Oil Dressing are types of dressings,
  they have distinct characteristics. Blue Cheese Dressing is made with blue cheese,
  often includes mayonnaise or sour cream, and has a distinctive taste and texture
  due to the blue cheese. On the other hand, Olive Oil Dressing is typically made
  primarily from olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, garlic, herbs, and spices, resulting
  in a different flavor profile. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.'
