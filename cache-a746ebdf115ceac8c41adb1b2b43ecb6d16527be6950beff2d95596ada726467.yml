text: ' No. Green beans and other leafy greens are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. While both green beans and leafy greens are types of vegetables,
  they belong to different botanical families and have distinct nutritional profiles.
  Green beans are legumes, while other leafy greens include varieties such as spinach,
  kale, and collard greens, which are all members of the Brassica family or other
  plant groups. Therefore, it is important to keep these two concepts separate for
  accurate categorization and labeling purposes.'
