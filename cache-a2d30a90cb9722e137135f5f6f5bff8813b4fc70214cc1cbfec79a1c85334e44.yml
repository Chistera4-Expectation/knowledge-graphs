text: No, 'Infused Tea' and 'Jasmine Tea' should not be merged as they represent different
  types of tea. Infused tea can refer to any tea that has been steeped in hot water,
  while Jasmine Tea specifically refers to tea leaves that have been scented with
  jasmine flowers. They are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
