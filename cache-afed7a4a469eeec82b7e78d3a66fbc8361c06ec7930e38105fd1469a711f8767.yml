text: ' No. Cottonseed oil and peanut oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While they may both fall under the broader category
  of edible vegetable oils, they have distinct chemical compositions, nutritional
  profiles, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate entries
  for each type of oil to accurately reflect their unique properties and characteristics.'
