text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct properties, ingredients,
  and uses. Sriracha sauce is a hot sauce made from chili peppers, vinegar, garlic,
  sugar, and salt, while Tartar sauce is a condiment typically made from mayonnaise,
  chopped pickles, capers, and onions, often used with seafood. These sauces are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates, as they serve different purposes and have unique
  ingredients and flavors.
