  While Cajun Seasoning and Old Bay Seasoning may share some similarities in terms
  of their use as general-purpose savory blends for enhancing food flavors, they have
  distinct differences that make them unique from one another. Here are some reasons
  why these two instances shouldn''t be merged:


  1. Ingredients: The ingredients used in both blends differ significantly. For instance,
  Cajun Seasoning typically contains garlic powder, paprika, salt, ground black pepper,
  onion powder, cayenne pepper, oregano, thyme, and sometimes basil. On the other
  hand, Old Bay Seasoning consists of celery salt, mustard, red pepper flakes, black
  pepper, bay leaves, cloves, allspice, ginger, mace, cardamom, and nutmeg among its
  many components. Merging these two would lead to loss of specificity regarding ingredient
  composition.

  2. Origin & Cuisine Type: Cajun Seasoning is associated with Louisiana Creole and
  Cajun cuisines, while Old Bay Seasoning has roots in Maryland seafood dishes like
  crab cakes and shrimp boils. Keeping them separate allows users to distinguish between
  regional influences and applications more accurately.

  3. Flavor Profile: Although both fall under "savory" category, each blend offers
  different flavor profiles due to variations in spices and herbs used. Lumping them
  together might cause confusion when trying to identify desired taste characteristics.

  4. Usage Differences: There could be various recipes where substituting one for
  another wouldn''t yield optimal results because of the contrasting tastes and aromas
  provided by individual components within each mix. Maintaining them separately ensures
  accurate representation of usage scenarios.'
