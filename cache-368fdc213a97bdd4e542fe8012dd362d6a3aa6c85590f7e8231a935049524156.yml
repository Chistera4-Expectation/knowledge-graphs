  While tahini dressing and wasabi dressing may both fall under the category of "food
  dressings," they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. Semantically, they
  have different meanings: tahini dressing is made from sesame seed paste while wasabi
  dressing contains wasabi, a Japanese horseradish. Ontologically, they belong to
  distinct categories with unique properties and uses. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
