text: ' The most adequate class for "Corned Beef" would be "Pork-derived Food" or
  more generally, "Meat." However, since the options are limited and do not include
  "Meat," I would choose "Poultry-derived Food" as it is the closest option. Corned
  beef is made from beef, which is a type of meat, but none of the provided classes
  specifically refer to beef or meat in general.'
