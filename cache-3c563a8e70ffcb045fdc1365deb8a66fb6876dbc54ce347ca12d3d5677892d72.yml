text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both 'Pheasant Gravy' and 'Turkey Gravy' are derived from poultry, they are made
  from different types of poultry and may have different ingredients, preparation
  methods, or nutritional profiles. Therefore, they should remain as separate instances
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.
