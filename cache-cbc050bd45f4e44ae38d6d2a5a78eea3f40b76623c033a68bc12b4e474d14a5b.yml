text: No, Feta cheese and Parmesan cheese are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  They are distinct types of cheese with different origins, production methods, and
  uses. While they both fall under the broader category of cheese, they should not
  be merged together in a class or dataset representing different types of cheeses.
