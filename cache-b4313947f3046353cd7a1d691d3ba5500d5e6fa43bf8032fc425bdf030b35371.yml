  While blue cheese dressing and poppy seed dressing may belong to the same general
  category of food (i.e., salad dressings), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Semantically, they have different meanings: blue cheese dressing is made with blue
  cheese, while poppy seed dressing contains poppy seeds. Ontologically, they represent
  distinct entities with unique properties and characteristics. Merging them would
  result in loss of important information about each individual type of dressing.'
