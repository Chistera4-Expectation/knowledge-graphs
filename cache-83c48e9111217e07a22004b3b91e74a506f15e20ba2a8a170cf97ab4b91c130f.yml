  While sunflower oil and palm oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, sources, and production
  methods. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.


  Sunflower oil is derived from the seeds of the sunflower plant (Helianthus annuus)
  and has a high concentration of polyunsaturated fats, particularly linoleic acid.
  It also contains some monounsaturated fatty acids and small amounts of saturated
  fats. Sunflower oil is often used for cooking due to its light taste and high smoke
  point.


  Palm oil, on the other hand, comes from the fruit of the oil palms (Elaeis guineensis).
  It consists primarily of saturated fats, with smaller amounts of mono- and polyunsaturated
  fats. Palm oil has gained controversy over concerns about deforestation and habitat
  destruction caused by large-scale cultivation. Nutritionally, excessive consumption
  of saturated fats can raise cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease.


  Given these distinctions, it is important to maintain separate categories for sunflower
  oil and palm oil when discussing edible vegetable oils.'
