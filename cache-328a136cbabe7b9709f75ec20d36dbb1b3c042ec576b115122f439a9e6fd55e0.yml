text: No, the instances 'Optional additions' and 'Optional ingredients' should not
  be merged together. Although they may seem similar, they refer to different aspects
  of food seasoning. 'Optional additions' typically refers to additional flavorings
  or toppings that can be added to a dish, while 'Optional ingredients' refers to
  the ingredients themselves that can be omitted or substituted without significantly
  affecting the overall recipe. These two concepts serve different purposes in food
  seasoning and should be kept separate.
