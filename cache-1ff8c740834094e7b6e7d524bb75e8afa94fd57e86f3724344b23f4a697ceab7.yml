text: ' No. Sunflower oil and walnut oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils. They come
  from different plant sources (sunflowers vs walnuts) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles, cooking properties, and uses. Therefore, it is important to keep them
  separate when discussing or categorizing edible oils.'
