text: No, Enoki mushrooms and Shiitake mushrooms should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they are both edible mushrooms, they
  have distinct characteristics, appearances, and culinary uses. Merging them together
  would lose the specific information about each type of mushroom.
