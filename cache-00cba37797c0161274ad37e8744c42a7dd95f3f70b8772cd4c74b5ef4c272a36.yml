text: ' "Energy Drink" would be the most appropriate class name for this group as
  all energy drinks are designed to provide an energy boost, often containing caffeine
  and other stimulants. The other items in the list serve different nutritional purposes
  such as hydration (water), sources of carbohydrates or protein (milk, honey, juices)
  or alcohol which provides calories but has negative health effects when consumed
  excessively. Edible vegetable oil is not typically considered an energy drink due
  to its primary role as a source of fat rather than quick energy.'
