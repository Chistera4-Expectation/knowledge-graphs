text: ' No. Basmati rice and sushi rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. While both are types of rice, they have
  different properties, uses, and cultural significance. Basmati rice is a long-grain
  variety from India and Pakistan known for its aroma and nutty flavor, often used
  in Indian, Middle Eastern, and Central Asian cuisine. Sushi rice, on the other hand,
  is a short-grain Japanese rice that becomes sticky when cooked, making it ideal
  for preparing various forms of sushi. Merging them would lead to confusion and loss
  of important distinctions between these two unique rice varieties.'
