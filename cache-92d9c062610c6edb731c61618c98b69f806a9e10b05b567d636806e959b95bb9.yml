  While both white pepper and habanero peppers are types of pepper, they have different
  flavors, heat levels, uses, and appearances. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. White pepper is milder with
  a subtle flavor, while habanero peppers are known for their intense heat and fruity
  flavor. They serve distinct purposes in cooking and recipes.'
