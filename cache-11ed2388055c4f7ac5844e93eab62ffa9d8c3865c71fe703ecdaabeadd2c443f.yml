text: As a dietician, I can provide an answer based on nutrition and not ontology.
  From a nutritional standpoint, "Boneless chicken" and "Chicken" refer to the same
  poultry meat but with the bones removed in the case of boneless chicken. While they
  are not semantically or ontologically identical, they share many similarities in
  nutritional content. However, they are not considered duplicates in this context
  since they represent different forms of chicken.
