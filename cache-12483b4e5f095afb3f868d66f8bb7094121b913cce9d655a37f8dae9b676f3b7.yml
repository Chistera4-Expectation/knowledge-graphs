text: No, "Quail Nuggets" and "Quail Wings" should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are derived from quail meat, they are different food products
  with distinct preparation methods and textures. The term "duplicate" implies that
  they are identical, which is not the case. They are different instances within the
  Poultry-derived Food class.
