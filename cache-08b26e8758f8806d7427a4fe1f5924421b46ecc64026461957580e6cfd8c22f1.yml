  different poultry-derived food items with distinct nutritional profiles, preparation
  methods, and uses in recipes. Chicken Breast is a lean, high-protein cut of meat,
  while Chicken Stock is a liquid made by simmering chicken bones, vegetables, and
  herbs, which is used as a base for soups and sauces.
