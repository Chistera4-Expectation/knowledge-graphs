text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both oils are derived from plant sources and have a nutty aroma, they have distinct
  chemical compositions, properties, and uses in cooking and other applications. Almond
  oil is extracted from almonds, while sesame oil is derived from sesame seeds. They
  also have different nutritional profiles and health benefits.
