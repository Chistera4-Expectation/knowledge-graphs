text: No, Bulgarian Yogurt and Greek Yogurt should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics
  and production methods that differentiate them from each other. Bulgarian Yogurt
  is made using specific Lactobacillus Bulgaricus bacteria, while Greek Yogurt is
  strained to achieve a thicker consistency.
