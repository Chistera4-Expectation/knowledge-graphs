text: ' No. Avocado oil and chili oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they are both edible vegetable oils. They come from different plants
  and have unique properties and uses. Avocado oil is extracted from the fruit of
  the avocado tree, while chili oil is made by infusing oil with hot chili peppers.
  Therefore, they should not be merged together.'
