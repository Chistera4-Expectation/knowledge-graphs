  While both extra virgin olive oil and walnut oil are types of edible vegetable oils,
  they have distinct properties and uses that make them unique from one another. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Extra virgin olive oil is known for its high concentration of monounsaturated
  fats, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory compounds, making it a popular choice
  for salad dressings and cooking at low temperatures. Walnut oil, on the other hand,
  has a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly omega-3 fatty
  acids, which can help reduce inflammation and improve heart health. It also has
  a distinctive nutty flavor that makes it suitable for use in sauces, marinades,
  and drizzling over finished dishes.'
