text: ' No, Buckwheat honey and Creamed honey are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They refer to different types of honey with distinct characteristics. Buckwheat
  honey is a type of honey made from the nectar of buckwheat flowers, while creamed
  honey is honey that has been processed to create a spreadable consistency. Therefore,
  they should not be merged together as duplicates.'
