  While blue cheese dressing and wasabi dressing may both fall under the category
  of "food dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they
  have distinctly different ingredients, flavors, textures, and uses. Blue cheese
  dressing is typically made with cream, milk, vinegar, sugar, blue cheese, salt,
  pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Wasabi dressing, on the other hand, usually
  consists of soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, canola oil, green onions,
  wasabi paste, ginger, and garlic. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two instances as duplicates.'
