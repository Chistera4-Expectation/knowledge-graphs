text: 'No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both are poultry-derived food items, they are distinct types of food: Pheasant
  Meat is a specific type of meat from the pheasant bird, whereas Turkey Meatballs
  are a dish made from ground turkey, combined with other ingredients like breadcrumbs,
  herbs, and spices. They can be considered related, but they are not the same thing.'
