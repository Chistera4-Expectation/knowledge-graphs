  Chicken nuggets and grilled chicken are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  despite both being poultry-derived foods. They have different nutritional profiles
  due to varying preparation methods (e.g., breading, frying vs. grilling). Merging
  them would disregard these critical distinctions for consumers seeking specific
  dietary information.'
