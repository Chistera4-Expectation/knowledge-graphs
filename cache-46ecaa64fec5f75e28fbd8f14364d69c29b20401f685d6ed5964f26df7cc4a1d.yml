  While both "shredded mozzarella cheese" and "serving size of the cheese" are related
  to cheese, they refer to different concepts and thus should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.


  "Shredded mozzarella cheese" refers to a specific type of cheese that has been shredded
  into small pieces, while "serving size of the cheese" refers to the amount of cheese
  that is recommended for consumption in one sitting. These two concepts have distinct
  meanings and uses in nutrition and food preparation contexts.'
