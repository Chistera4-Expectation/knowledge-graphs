text: No, they should not be merged as they have different nutritional profiles and
  are processed differently. Chicken feet are primarily made of skin, bones, and cartilage,
  while chicken sausage is a processed meat product made from ground chicken meat,
  fat, and seasonings. The nutritional composition and preparation methods of these
  two food items are distinct from each other.
