text: No, coconut water and spring-fed water should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. They are distinct types of water with different compositions,
  sources, and properties. Coconut water comes from young green coconuts and contains
  natural sugars, salts, and vitamins, while spring-fed water is sourced from underground
  aquifers and is typically free from additives and contaminants.
