text: 'No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from quails, they are different food products: "Quail Stock" refers
  to the liquid obtained from boiling quail bones, meat, and vegetables, while "Quail
  Tenders" refer to the meaty part of the quail, typically prepared as a dish. They
  are distinct items with different culinary uses and nutritional profiles.'
