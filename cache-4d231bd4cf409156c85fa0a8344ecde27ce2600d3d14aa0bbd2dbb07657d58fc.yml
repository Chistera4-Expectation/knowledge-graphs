text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both infusions contain cinnamon, they are not the same due to the different fruit
  components (orange vs. pear). The flavor profiles and nutritional properties of
  these infusions would differ, making them distinct instances within the Infusion
  Drink class.
