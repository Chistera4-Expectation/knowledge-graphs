text: No, Bouillon powder and Curry Powder should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are food seasonings, they have distinct ingredients,
  flavors, and uses in cooking. Bouillon powder is typically used to add savory, umami
  flavor to soups, stews, and sauces, while curry powder is a blend of spices used
  to add a complex flavor profile to curries, rice dishes, and other savory dishes.
