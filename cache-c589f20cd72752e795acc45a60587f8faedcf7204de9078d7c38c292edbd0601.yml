text: No, while both "Crab meat" and "Snow Crab" are types of edible crustaceans,
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. "Crab meat" is a general term referring
  to the meat from any crab species, whereas "Snow Crab" is a specific species of
  crab (Chionoecetes opilio). They should not be merged as they represent different
  levels of specificity in the classification hierarchy.
