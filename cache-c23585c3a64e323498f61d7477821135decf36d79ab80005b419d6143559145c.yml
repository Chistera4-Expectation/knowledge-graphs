text: No, French Yogurt and Frozen Yogurt should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are two distinct types of yogurt with different properties and
  characteristics. French Yogurt typically refers to a type of yogurt with a thicker
  consistency and a slightly tangy flavor, while Frozen Yogurt is a frozen dessert
  made from yogurt. Although both are yogurt-based products, they have unique features
  that warrant separate classifications.
