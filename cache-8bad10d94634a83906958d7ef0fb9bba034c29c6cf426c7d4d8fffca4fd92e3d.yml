  While black pepper and red pepper flakes are both types of spices, they have different
  tastes, appearances, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Black pepper typically comes
  from dried and ground peppercorns, while red pepper flakes usually consist of crushed
  dried red chili peppers. They do not share enough commonalities to warrant merging
  them together.'
