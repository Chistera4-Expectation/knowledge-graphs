text: No, Green Tea and Jasmine Tea should not be merged together as they are different
  types of tea with distinct characteristics. Green Tea refers to tea leaves that
  are not oxidized during processing, while Jasmine Tea is a type of scented tea made
  by infusing green tea leaves with the fragrance of jasmine flowers. Although they
  may share some similarities as types of tea, they are unique and separate entities
  in terms of semantics and ontology.
