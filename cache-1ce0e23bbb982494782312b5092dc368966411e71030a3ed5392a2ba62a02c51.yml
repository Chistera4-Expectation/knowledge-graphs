text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Drinkable
  Yogurt and French Yogurt have distinct properties and characteristics. Drinkable
  Yogurt is a liquid form of yogurt, while French Yogurt is a type of yogurt with
  specific ingredients, preparation methods, and cultural associations. Merging them
  would result in a loss of information and specificity.
