  Chili powder is a blend of spices that usually includes ground chilies, garlic,
  cumin, and oregano, while bouillon powder is typically made from dehydrated vegetables,
  meat (or vegetable) broth, seasonings, and sometimes MSG. They serve different culinary
  purposes and impart unique flavors to dishes. Therefore, they are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates.'
