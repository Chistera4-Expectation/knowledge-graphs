  While raw wildflower honey and sage honey may both fall under the category of "honey,"
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct botanical
  origins and flavor profiles. Raw wildflower honey is made from nectar collected
  by bees from various wildflowers, while sage honey specifically comes from bees
  that pollinate sage plants. These differences can impact taste, color, texture,
  and other properties, making them unique subtypes within the broader category of
  honey.'
