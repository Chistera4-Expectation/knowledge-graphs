text: No, 'Quail Nuggets' and 'Quail Patties' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both derived from quail meat, they
  have different forms and preparation methods, which can result in distinct nutritional
  profiles and culinary applications. Therefore, they should be considered separate
  instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
