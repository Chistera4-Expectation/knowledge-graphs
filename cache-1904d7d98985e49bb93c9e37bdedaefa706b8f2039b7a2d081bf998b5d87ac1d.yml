  The term "bread" refers to a general category of baked goods made from flour, water,
  yeast, salt, and sometimes other ingredients. "Ciabatta bread," on the other hand,
  is a specific type of bread that originated in Italy and has a distinct texture
  and flavor profile compared to other types of bread. While both are types of bread,
  they have different characteristics and can serve different purposes in cooking
  and nutrition. Therefore, it makes sense to keep them separate rather than merging
  them into a single concept.'
