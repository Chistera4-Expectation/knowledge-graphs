  While honey is a general category of sweet substance produced by bees from the nectar
  of flowers, different types of honey (such as Linden Honey) can have distinct flavor
  profiles, nutritional content, and other properties that make them unique. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge all instances of "honey" into one generic category
  without acknowledging these differences. Each type of honey should be treated as
  a separate instance with its own specific characteristics and attributes.'
