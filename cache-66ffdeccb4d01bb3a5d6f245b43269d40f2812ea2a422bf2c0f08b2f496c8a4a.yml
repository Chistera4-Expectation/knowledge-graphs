text: No, the instances 'Chicken of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Hedgehog Mushroom' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible
  mushrooms, they are distinct species with different characteristics, appearances,
  and culinary uses. 'Chicken of the Woods' (Laetiporus spp.) is known for its chicken-like
  texture and flavor, while 'Hedgehog Mushroom' (Hydnum repandum) has a unique appearance
  with spines on the underside instead of gills. Keeping these as separate instances
  allows for more accurate identification and distinction between the two species.
