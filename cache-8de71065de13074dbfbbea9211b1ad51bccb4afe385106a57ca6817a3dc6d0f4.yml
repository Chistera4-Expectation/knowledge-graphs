text: No, the instances 'Gluten-Free Bread' and 'Multigrain Bread' should not be merged
  together as they are different types of bread with distinct characteristics and
  ingredients. While they both fall under the broader category of bread, their specific
  features and nutritional profiles make them unique and not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
