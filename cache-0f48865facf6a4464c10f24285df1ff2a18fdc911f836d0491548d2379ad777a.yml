text: ' The most appropriate category for ''Fruit'' among the given options is not
  provided in this list. However, if we consider fruits as part of dairy products
  or milk-based items, then ''Yogurt'' could be considered the closest option to fruit.
  But ideally, ''Fruit'' should have its own distinct category separate from these
  dairy products.'
