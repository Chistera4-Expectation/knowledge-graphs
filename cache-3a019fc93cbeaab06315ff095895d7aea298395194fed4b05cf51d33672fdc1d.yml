text: No, 'Ground Pork' and 'Pork Shank' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both derived from pork, they are different cuts with
  distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. 'Ground Pork' is ground meat typically
  used for sausages, meatballs, and other dishes, while 'Pork Shank' is a cut from
  the lower part of the front leg, often used in slow-cooked dishes and soups.
