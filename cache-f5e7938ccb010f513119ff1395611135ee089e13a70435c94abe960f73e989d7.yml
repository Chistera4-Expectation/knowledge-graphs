text: No, they should not be merged. While both "Additional seasonings" and "Optional
  additions" may refer to extra ingredients or flavorings, they can still have distinct
  meanings within the context of a recipe or dish. For example, "Additional seasonings"
  might refer to specific spices or herbs that can enhance the flavor of a dish, while
  "Optional additions" might refer to additional ingredients that can be added based
  on personal preference or dietary needs. In this case, they are not duplicates but
  rather serve different purposes in the food seasoning class.
