text: No, they should not be merged as they are different cuts of beef with different
  preparation methods and uses. Corned beef brisket is a salt-cured beef brisket,
  while beef patties are ground beef formed into patties, typically for hamburgers.
  These differences in preparation and usage make them distinct entities in the Beef
  class.
