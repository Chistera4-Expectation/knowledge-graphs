text: No, Argan Oil and margarine should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Argan Oil is a natural oil extracted from the kernels of the Argan tree,
  while margarine is a processed food product made from vegetable oils and other ingredients,
  such as water, salt, and emulsifiers. Although both are edible vegetal oils, they
  have different properties, uses, and nutritional profiles.
