text: No, the instances 'Ostrich Gravy' and 'Pheasant Gravy' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although both are derived from
  poultry and share some similarities, they are distinct types of gravy made from
  different poultry sources. Merging them would not accurately represent the variety
  of poultry-derived foods.
