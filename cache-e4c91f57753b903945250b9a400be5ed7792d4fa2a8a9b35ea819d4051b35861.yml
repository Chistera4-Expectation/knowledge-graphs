text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of drinking
  water. Boiling water and tap water have different properties and uses. Boiling water
  is a method of purifying water by bringing it to a rolling boil, while tap water
  is water that comes directly from a faucet. Although both can be used for drinking,
  they are not the same and should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
