text: No, Alfalfa Honey and Pine Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have distinct characteristics,
  flavors, and production methods based on the specific plants they are derived from.
  Merging them would not accurately represent their unique qualities.
