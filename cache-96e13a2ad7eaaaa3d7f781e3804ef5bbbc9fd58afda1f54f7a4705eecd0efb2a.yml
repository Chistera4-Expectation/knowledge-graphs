text: No, Rain Water and Sparkling Water should not be merged together as they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates. Rain Water is a natural water source that
  falls from the sky, while Sparkling Water is artificially carbonated water. They
  differ in their origin, characteristics, and usage.
