  While chia seeds and flaxseeds have some similarities (for example, they are both
  sources of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids), they also have important differences
  in terms of their nutritional profiles and potential health benefits. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to maintain them as separate categories rather than merging them
  into a single category. This allows for more specific information about each type
  of seed to be captured and communicated accurately.'
