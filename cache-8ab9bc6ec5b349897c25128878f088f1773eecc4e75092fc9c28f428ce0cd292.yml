text: ' A pudding can be classified as a "Dessert" or more specifically, a "Custard."
  It is not the most adequate class compared to the other options you provided since
  they are all dairy products. However, if we consider them in terms of their typical
  uses and nutritional profiles, then "Dessert" would be the most concise and appropriate
  class for pudding.'
