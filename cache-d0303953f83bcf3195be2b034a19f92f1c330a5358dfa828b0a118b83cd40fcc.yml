  The terms "sliced tomatoes" and "diced tomatoes" describe different forms of tomato
  preparation, which can impact their usage in various recipes and dishes. While they
  are both derived from tomatoes, they have distinct textures and functional properties
  that make them suitable for different culinary applications. Therefore, it is not
  appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
