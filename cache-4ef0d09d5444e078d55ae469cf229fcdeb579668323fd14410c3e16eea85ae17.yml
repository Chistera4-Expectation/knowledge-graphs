text: ' No. Mozzarella cheese and Swiss cheese are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they are both types of cheese. They have distinct characteristics, such
  as taste, texture, production method, and cultural origin, that make them unique
  from one another. Therefore, it is important to keep these two instances separate
  when discussing or categorizing different types of cheese.'
