text: No, they should not be merged. Although they are derived from the same plant,
  coriander seeds and coriander powder have different properties and uses in cooking
  and nutrition. Coriander seeds have a different flavor profile and texture compared
  to coriander powder, which is ground from the seeds. Additionally, their nutritional
  values may differ slightly.
