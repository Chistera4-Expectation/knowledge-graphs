  Mustard seeds and sunflower seeds are both types of edible seeds, but they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, textures, and uses in cooking and food preparation.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates from a dietary perspective.


  Merging these two instances could lead to confusion about their unique properties
  and potential health benefits, which is why it''s essential to maintain separate
  categories for each type of seed. This way, individuals can make informed decisions
  based on accurate information when choosing between different options within the
  category of "edible seeds."'
