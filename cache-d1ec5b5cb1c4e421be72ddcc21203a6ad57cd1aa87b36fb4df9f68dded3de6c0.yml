text: No, the instances '(Optional) Fresh lemon juice' and 'Lemon' should not be merged
  together as they represent different aspects of the fruit. 'Lemon' refers to the
  whole fruit itself, while '(Optional) Fresh lemon juice' refers to the juice extracted
  from the lemon. They can be related, but they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
