  While chili paste and chili flakes are both used for adding spice and flavor to
  food, they have different physical properties and uses in cooking. Chili paste is
  typically made from ground chilies blended with other ingredients such as vinegar,
  oil, or garlic, resulting in a smooth, thick sauce consistency. On the other hand,
  chili flakes consist of dried, crushed red pepper flakes that can be sprinkled on
  top of dishes for a burst of heat and texture. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates because they serve distinct
  purposes and offer unique culinary experiences despite sharing some similarities.'
