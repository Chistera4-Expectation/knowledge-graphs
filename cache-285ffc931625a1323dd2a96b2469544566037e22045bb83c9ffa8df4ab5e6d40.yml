  While both fresh cilantro leaves and other leafy greens fall under the general category
  of vegetables and are often used for similar purposes (such as adding flavor and
  nutrition to dishes), they have distinct differences in taste, appearance, and nutritional
  profiles that make them non-duplicate entities. Fresh cilantro leaves have a unique,
  strong aroma and flavor that is not found in most other leafy greens, while "other
  leafy greens" can encompass a wide variety of plants with varying flavors, textures,
  and appearances. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
