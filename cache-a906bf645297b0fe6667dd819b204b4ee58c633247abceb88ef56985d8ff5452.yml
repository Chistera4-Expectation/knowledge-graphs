text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct types of sauces
  with different ingredients and characteristics. Hollandaise sauce is a creamy, buttery
  sauce typically made with egg yolks, lemon juice, and butter, while sour sauce is
  a tangy sauce made with vinegar, sugar, and other spices. These sauces serve different
  purposes in cooking and have distinct flavor profiles.
