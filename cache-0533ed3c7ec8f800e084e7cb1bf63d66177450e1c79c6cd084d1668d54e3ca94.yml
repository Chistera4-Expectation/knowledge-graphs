text: ' "Ice Cream" would be the most appropriate class name for ice cream among butter,
  cheese, milk, and yogurt. Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from dairy
  products such as milk and cream, sweeteners like sugar, and sometimes other ingredients
  like fruit or chocolate. It differs significantly from butter, which is a dairy
  product used primarily for cooking and baking; cheese, which is a fermented milk
  product; and yogurt, which is a liquid or semi-solid food produced by the bacterial
  fermentation of milk.'
