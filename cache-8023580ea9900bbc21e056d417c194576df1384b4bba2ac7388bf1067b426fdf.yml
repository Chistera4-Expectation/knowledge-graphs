text: ' No, Blueberries and Strawberries are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they both fall under the category of "Edible Fruits," they have distinct characteristics
  such as taste, texture, nutritional profile, growth habits, and physical appearance
  that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate
  instances for each fruit.'
