text: No, the instances 'Juice' and 'Lime juice' should not be merged together as
  they are not semantic and ontological duplicates. 'Juice' is a general term for
  any liquid extracted from fruit or vegetables, while 'Lime juice' is a specific
  type of juice derived from limes. Although they both fall under the broader category
  of juice, they are distinct entities and should be treated as separate instances.
