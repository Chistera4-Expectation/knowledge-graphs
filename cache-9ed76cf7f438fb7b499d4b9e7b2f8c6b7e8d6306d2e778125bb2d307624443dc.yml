text: No, the instances 'Infused Water' and 'Well Water' should not be merged together
  as they are distinct types of drinking water with different characteristics and
  methods of preparation. Infused water refers to water that has been flavored with
  fruits, herbs, or other ingredients, while well water comes from underground sources
  and may have varying mineral content.
