  Although acacia honey and sage honey can both be classified under the general category
  of "honey," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct
  botanical origins and potentially different flavor profiles, nutritional content,
  and uses. Acacia honey is derived from the nectar of various species of Robinia
  (acacia) trees, while sage honey comes from the flowers of Salvia officinalis (sage)
  plants. Keeping them separate allows for more accurate labeling, description, and
  understanding of their unique characteristics and applications.'
