text: No, 'Alfalfa Honey' and 'Blueberry Honey' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of honey, they have different
  sources and may have distinct flavor profiles and nutritional properties. Merging
  them together would not accurately represent the differences between these honey
  varieties.
