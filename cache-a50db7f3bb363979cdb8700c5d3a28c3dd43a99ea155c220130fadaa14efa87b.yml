text: As a dietician, I would advise that "Peas" and "Frozen Peas" should not be merged
  together as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both
  types of peas, they differ in terms of their form and preparation. "Frozen Peas"
  specifically refers to peas that have been frozen, while "Peas" could include any
  form of peas, including fresh, canned, or frozen. Merging them together could cause
  confusion and not accurately represent the variety of options available.
