text: No, the instances 'Crab' and 'Dungeness Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While Dungeness Crab is a type of crab, it
  is a specific species (Cancer magister) with unique characteristics and nutritional
  properties. Merging them would result in a loss of information about the unique
  aspects of Dungeness Crab.
