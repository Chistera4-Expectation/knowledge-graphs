text: No, 'English Breakfast Tea' and 'Pu-erh Tea' are not semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are distinct types of tea with different characteristics, flavors,
  and origins. English Breakfast Tea is a blend of black teas, while Pu-erh Tea is
  a post-fermented tea from China. Although they both fall under the category of tea,
  they are not the same.
