  The instance ": The base ingredient of the sauce" is a more general concept that
  can represent any ingredient used as a base for various sauces. On the other hand,
  "Oyster sauce" is a specific type of sauce with its unique ingredients and characteristics.
  Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates since
  they serve different purposes within the context of discussing sauces.'
