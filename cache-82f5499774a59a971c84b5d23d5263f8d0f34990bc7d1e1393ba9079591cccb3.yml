text: No, "Ostrich Broth" and "Ostrich Soup" should not be merged as they are not
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Although both are derived from ostrich, "Broth"
  refers to the liquid that remains after cooking meat or vegetables, while "Soup"
  generally includes broth, but also features additional ingredients such as vegetables,
  pasta, or rice. They are distinct types of poultry-derived food.
