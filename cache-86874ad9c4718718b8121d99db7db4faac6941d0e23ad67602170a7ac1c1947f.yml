text: No, Turkey Gizzards and Turkey Patties should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are derived from turkey, they are distinct
  food products with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Turkey Gizzards
  are primarily composed of muscle tissue, while Turkey Patties are made from ground
  turkey meat and may contain other ingredients like breadcrumbs or seasonings.
