  While both "low-sodium chicken broth" and "rotisserie chicken" are poultry-derived
  foods, they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they
  represent different food items with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in meal
  preparation. Low-sodium chicken broth is primarily used for adding flavor to dishes
  like soups, stews, and sauces, while rotisserie chickens serve as standalone entrees
  or ingredients in various recipes such as salads, sandwiches, and casseroles. Merging
  them would not accurately reflect their unique roles in a well-balanced diet.'
