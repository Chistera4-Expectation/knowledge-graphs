  While both Light Butter and Spreadable Butter are types of butter, they have distinct
  characteristics. Light Butter typically has a lower fat content than regular butter,
  while Spreadable Butter is formulated to be softer and easier to spread, often by
  adding oils or other ingredients. These differences in composition and usage warrant
  their separation as distinct instances within the Butter class.
