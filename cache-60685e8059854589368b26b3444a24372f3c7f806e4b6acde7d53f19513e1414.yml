text: ' No. Creamed honey and raspberry honey are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They refer to different types of honey products
  with distinct characteristics.


  Creamed honey is a type of honey that has been processed to create a smooth and
  spreadable texture by controlled crystallization, while raspberry honey is a variety
  of honey made from the nectar collected by bees from raspberry flowers. Therefore,
  they belong to separate categories based on their production method and source of
  nectar.'
