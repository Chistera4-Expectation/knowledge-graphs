text: No, Acacia Honey and Manuka Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of honey, they have distinct characteristics,
  origins, and properties. Acacia Honey comes from the nectar of the Black Locust
  tree, has a mild taste, and is often used as a natural sweetener. Manuka Honey,
  on the other hand, comes from the nectar of the Manuka tree in New Zealand, has
  a strong flavor, and is known for its potential health benefits and medicinal properties.
  Merging these two would result in a loss of specific information and could lead
  to confusion.
