text: ' "Breakfast Cereal, Edible Grains and Seeds" (or simply "Grains and Seeds")
  would be an appropriate class for Oats. This category includes foods that are primarily
  composed of grains such as oats, quinoa, rice, or seeds like chia seeds, which are
  commonly consumed as part of a breakfast meal but can also be included in other
  meals throughout the day. These foods provide essential nutrients including fiber,
  B vitamins, minerals, and healthy carbohydrates.'
