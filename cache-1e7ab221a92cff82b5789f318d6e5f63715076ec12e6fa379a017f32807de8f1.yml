text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Hard Water
  and Tap Water have distinct properties and characteristics. Hard Water refers to
  water with high mineral content, typically calcium and magnesium, while Tap Water
  refers to water that is supplied from a public water system to homes and businesses.
  Although they can both be types of drinking water, they are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
