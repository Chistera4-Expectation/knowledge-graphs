text: No, these instances should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both types of edible vegetal oils, they serve different
  purposes and have distinct characteristics (e.g., sesame oil has a nutty aroma,
  while cooking oil does not necessarily have that specific aroma). Keeping them as
  separate instances allows for better distinction and organization of the information
  within the class.
