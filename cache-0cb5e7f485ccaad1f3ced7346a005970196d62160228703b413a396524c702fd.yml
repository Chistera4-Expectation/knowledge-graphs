text: No, the instances 'Turkey Gravy' and 'Turkey Thighs' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from turkey, they are
  distinct food items with different nutritional profiles and cooking methods. Turkey
  Gravy is a liquid, whereas Turkey Thighs are solid. Merging them together would
  not accurately represent the differences between the two.
