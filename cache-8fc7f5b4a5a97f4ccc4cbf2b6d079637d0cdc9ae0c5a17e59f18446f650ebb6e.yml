text: No, Pine Honey and Sage Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of honey, they are distinct
  types of honey with unique flavors and properties derived from the specific plant
  sources they come from. Merging them would disregard these important differences.
