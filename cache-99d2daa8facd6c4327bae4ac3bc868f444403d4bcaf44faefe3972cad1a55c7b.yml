text: ' No, eggplant and fresh cilantro leaves are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They belong to different vegetable categories (i.e., fruit vs. herb), have distinct
  tastes, textures, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking. Therefore, they should
  remain separate instances within the edible vegetable class.'
