text: No, 'Ginger Tea' and 'Herbal Tea' should not be merged together as they are
  not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While ginger tea is a type of herbal tea,
  they are different in terms of their specific ingredients and properties. Ginger
  tea is made from ginger root, while herbal tea can be made from a variety of different
  herbs and plants. Therefore, they should be considered separate instances in the
  Tea class.
