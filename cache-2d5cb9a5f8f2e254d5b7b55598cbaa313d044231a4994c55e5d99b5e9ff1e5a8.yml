  \nB\xE9chamel sauce and Chili sauce are two distinct sauces with different ingredients,\
  \ flavors, and uses in cooking. B\xE9chamel sauce is a white sauce made from a roux\
  \ (flour and butter) and milk, while Chili sauce is a spicy sauce made from chili\
  \ peppers, vinegar, and other seasonings. Given their differences in composition\
  \ and culinary applications, I would not recommend merging them as semantic and\
  \ ontological duplicates. However, it ultimately depends on the specific classification\
  \ system being used and its goals."
