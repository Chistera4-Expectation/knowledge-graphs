text: No, "Cream" and "Ice cream" should not be merged together as they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates. Although they share the word "cream" and are both dairy
  products, they are distinct food items with different nutritional properties and
  uses. "Cream" typically refers to the high-fat, liquid portion of milk, while "Ice
  cream" is a frozen dessert made from a mixture of cream, sugar, and flavorings.
  Merging these two instances would not accurately represent the differences between
  them.
