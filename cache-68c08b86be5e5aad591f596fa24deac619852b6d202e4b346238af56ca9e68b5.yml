text: ' No. Enoki mushrooms are a specific type of mushroom with unique characteristics
  and nutritional profile compared to other types of mushrooms. They should not be
  merged with the general term "mushrooms" which encompasses all varieties of mushrooms.
  It is important to keep them separate for clarity and accuracy in communication
  and research.'
