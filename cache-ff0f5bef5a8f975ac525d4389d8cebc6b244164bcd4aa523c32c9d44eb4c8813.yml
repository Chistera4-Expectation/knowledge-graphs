text: No, they should not be merged together as they serve different purposes. Oxygenated
  water is water that has been infused with oxygen, often used for health benefits
  or to enhance the taste of beverages. Water for egg wash, on the other hand, is
  simply water that is used to create an egg wash mixture, typically for baking purposes.
  While both are types of water, their intended uses and contexts are distinct from
  each other.
