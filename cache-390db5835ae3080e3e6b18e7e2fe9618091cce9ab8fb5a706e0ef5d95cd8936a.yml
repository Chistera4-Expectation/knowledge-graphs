text: No, the instances 'Assorted fruit slices' and 'Fruits' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Assorted fruit slices' is a specific
  type of fruit preparation, while 'Fruits' is a more general category that includes
  all types of edible fruits. They serve different purposes and should be kept as
  separate instances in the Edible Fruit class.
