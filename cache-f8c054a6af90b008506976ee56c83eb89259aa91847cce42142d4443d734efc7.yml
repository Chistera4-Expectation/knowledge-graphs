  While flaxseeds and poppy seeds have some similarities (for example, they are both
  small, oil-rich seeds), they belong to different botanical families and possess
  distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as
  semantic and ontological duplicates from a dietary perspective. Here are their key
  differences:


  1. Botanical classification: Flaxseeds come from the Linum usitatissimum plant (flax
  or linseed), which belongs to the family Linaceae. Poppy seeds originate from Papaver
  somniferum (opium poppy) plants that belong to the family Papaveraceae. These two
  plants differ significantly in terms of growth habits, chemical composition, and
  medicinal properties.

  2. Nutritional content: While both types of seeds provide essential fatty acids,
  fiber, vitamins, and minerals, there are considerable variations between the two.
  For instance, flaxseeds contain higher amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, specifically
  alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). On the other hand, poppy seeds offer more iron, calcium,
  and zinc than flaxseeds but lower levels of ALA.

  3. Culinary uses: Both seeds can serve various purposes in cooking and baking; however,
  each has unique characteristics and applications. Flaxseeds are often ground into
  flour for thickening sauces, added to smoothies for extra nutrition, or used as
  an egg substitute due to their mucilage content. In contrast, poppy seeds have milder
  flavors and are frequently sprinkled on top of baked goods such as bread, rolls,
  pastries, and bagels. They also contribute to flavoring dishes like lemon poppy
  seed muffins and Austrian potato salad.

  4. Cultural significance: Although this may seem less relevant to nutrition, understanding
  cultural associations helps complete the picture when comparing these seeds. Flaxseeds
  have been cultivated for thousands of years for food, clothing, and industrial use.
  The ancient Egyptians revered flax fibers for making linen garments worn by royalty.
  Meanwhile, poppies hold historical importance in medicine, particularly opium production.
  However, culinary poppy seeds do not contain narcotic compounds found in certain
  varieties of poppy flowers.'
