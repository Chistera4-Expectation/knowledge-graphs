text: As a dietician, I would advise against merging 'Icelandic Yogurt' and 'Yogurt'
  as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to
  the broader category of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics and properties,
  such as texture, taste, and cultural background. Merging them would result in the
  loss of valuable information about the unique qualities of Icelandic Yogurt.
