  While both 'Ostrich Meat' and 'Ostrich Stock' are derived from ostriches, they represent
  different types of food products. Ostrich meat is a type of poultry, whereas ostrich
  stock is a liquid cooking ingredient made by simmering ostrich bones and other ingredients.
  These are distinct food items and should be treated as separate instances within
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
