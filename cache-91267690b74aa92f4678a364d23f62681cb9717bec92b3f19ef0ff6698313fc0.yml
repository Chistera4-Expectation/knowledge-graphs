text: ' No. Long-grain white rice and wild rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. Although both are types of rice, they have
  different nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and growth habits. Therefore, it
  is appropriate to keep them separate categories with distinct labels.'
