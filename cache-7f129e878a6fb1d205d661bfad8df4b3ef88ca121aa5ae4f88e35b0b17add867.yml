  While French dressing and Thousand Island dressing may have some similarities, they
  are distinct types of salad dressings with unique ingredients and flavor profiles.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Maintaining their separate identities allows for accurate labeling,
  categorization, and differentiation between the two dressings.'
