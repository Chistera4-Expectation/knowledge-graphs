text: No, Red Rice and White Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are different types of rice with distinct nutritional properties
  and culinary uses. Red Rice is a whole grain rice with a reddish-brown color, often
  containing more fiber, vitamins, and minerals than White Rice, which is milled to
  remove the bran and germ. Merging them would not accurately represent their differences.
