  The two instances, "Red bell pepper, sliced" and "bacon bits, diced vegetables,"
  are not identical in their composition or nutritional content, even though they
  may share some similarities in terms of being edible and made from plants. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
