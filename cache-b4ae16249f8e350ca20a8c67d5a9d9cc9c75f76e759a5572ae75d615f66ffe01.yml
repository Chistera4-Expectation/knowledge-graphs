text: No, Chanterelle mushrooms and Enoki mushrooms should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates because they are two different types of edible mushrooms
  with distinct characteristics, flavors, and culinary uses. Chanterelle mushrooms
  are funnel-shaped with a fruity aroma, while Enoki mushrooms are thin and long with
  a delicate, slightly sweet flavor. They belong to different genera within the fungi
  kingdom and should be treated as separate entities in a classification system.
