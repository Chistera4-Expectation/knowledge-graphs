text: ' No. Although both Eucalyptus honey and Fireweed honey are types of honey,
  they come from different plant sources (eucalyptus flowers vs fireweed plants) and
  have distinct flavor profiles, properties, and potential health benefits. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
