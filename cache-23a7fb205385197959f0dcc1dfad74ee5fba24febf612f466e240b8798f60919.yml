text: No, "Guinea Fowl Gizzards" and "Guinea Fowl Patties" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct food items made from different
  parts of the guinea fowl bird. Gizzards are a muscle used for grinding food, while
  patties are made from ground meat and can include various ingredients such as seasonings
  and binders. Although they both come from the same bird, they are different in terms
  of their preparation and culinary usage.
