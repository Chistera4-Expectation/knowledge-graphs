text: No, Chili oil and Rice Bran oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are two distinct types of edible vegetable oils with different
  properties, uses, and origins. Chili oil is made from chili peppers and typically
  used as a condiment or seasoning, while Rice Bran oil is extracted from the germ
  and inner husk of rice and is used for cooking and frying due to its high smoke
  point and health benefits.
