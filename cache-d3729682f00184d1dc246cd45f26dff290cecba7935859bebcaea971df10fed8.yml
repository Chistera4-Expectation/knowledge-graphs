text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both 'Pork Shank' and 'Roast Pork' are pork-derived foods, they refer to different
  cuts and cooking methods. A pork shank is a cut of meat from the lower part of a
  pig's leg, while roast pork can refer to a variety of cuts cooked by roasting. These
  differences in cut and preparation result in distinct culinary properties and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, they should be treated as separate entities in a dietician's
  classification system.
