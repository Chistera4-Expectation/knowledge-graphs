text: ' Veal (specifically, "Veal-derived Food") would be the most appropriate class
  for veal amongst beef, pork-derived food, and poultry-derived food. This is because
  veal refers specifically to meat from young cattle, whereas beef comes from adult
  cattle, and pork and poultry are derived from pigs and birds, respectively.'
