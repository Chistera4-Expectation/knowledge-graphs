  Although both "Italian Seasoning" and "Seasoning Cubes" are types of seasonings
  used in food, they refer to different things and serve distinct purposes in cooking.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.


  Italian Seasoning is a blend of herbs commonly used in Italian cuisine, typically
  including ingredients like basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, and marjoram. It comes
  in various forms such as dried herb blends or ground spices.


  On the other hand, Seasoning Cubes (also known as Bouillon Cubes) are concentrated
  flavor blocks made from dehydrated vegetables, meat extracts, and spices. They dissolve
  easily in hot water and are often added to soups, stews, sauces, and rice dishes
  for an umami boost.


  Since these two terms represent unique concepts with specific uses, they shouldn''t
  be treated as duplicates.'
