text: No, Porcelain Crab and Sand Crab should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they both belong to the Edible Crustaceans class, they are
  distinct species with different characteristics and appearances. Merging them would
  lead to a loss of information and accuracy in classification.
