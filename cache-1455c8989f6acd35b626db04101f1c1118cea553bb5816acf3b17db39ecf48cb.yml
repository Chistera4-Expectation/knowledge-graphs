text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'A2 Butter' and 'Spreadable
  Butter' may have some overlapping properties or characteristics, they are distinct
  types of butter with potentially different uses, production methods, and nutritional
  profiles. Merging them would not accurately represent the real-world distinctions
  between these types of butter.
