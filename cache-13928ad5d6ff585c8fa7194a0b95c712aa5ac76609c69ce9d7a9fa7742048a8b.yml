text: No, they should not be merged together. Buffalo milk and lactose-free milk are
  different types of milk with distinct characteristics. Buffalo milk is a type of
  milk derived from buffaloes, while lactose-free milk is regular milk with lactose
  removed or replaced to make it suitable for people with lactose intolerance. They
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
