text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of yogurt, they
  have distinct characteristics and purposes. Probiotic yogurt contains live and active
  cultures that provide health benefits, while savory yogurt is typically flavored
  with savory ingredients and used in non-sweet dishes. These differences make them
  separate entities in terms of semantics and ontology.
