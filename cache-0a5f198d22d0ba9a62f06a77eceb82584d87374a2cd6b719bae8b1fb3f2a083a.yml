text: Yes, from a semantic and ontological perspective, 'Pickled vegetables' and 'Pickles'
  can be considered as duplicates, as they both refer to vegetables preserved in a
  vinegar or brine solution. However, it is essential to note that the term 'pickled
  vegetables' is more general and can include a wider variety of vegetables, while
  'pickles' typically refers to cucumbers pickled in this manner. Therefore, in a
  more specific context, they may not be considered as duplicates.
