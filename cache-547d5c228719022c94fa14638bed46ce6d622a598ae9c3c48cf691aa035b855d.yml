text: ' No. Coconut oil and pumpkin seed oil are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils, they come from
  different plants (coconuts vs. pumpkin seeds) and have unique nutritional profiles
  and uses. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate and distinct within
  this class.'
