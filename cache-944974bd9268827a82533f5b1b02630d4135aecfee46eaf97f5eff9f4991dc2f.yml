text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  quail and turkey are both types of poultry, their gizzards have distinct nutritional
  profiles, sizes, and culinary uses. Therefore, they should be treated as separate
  instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
