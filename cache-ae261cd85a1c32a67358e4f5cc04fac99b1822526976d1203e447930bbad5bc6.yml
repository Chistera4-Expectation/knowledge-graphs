  While both "Calories per serving" and "Fiber per serving" provide information about
  nutrition content, they measure different aspects of food and are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates. Calories refer to the amount of energy contained in a serving
  of food, while fiber is a type of carbohydrate that cannot be digested and provides
  bulk to aid in digestion. Therefore, it''s important to keep these two properties
  separate when describing cheese or any other food item.'
