text: As a dietician, I can provide a general perspective on this topic. In the context
  of drinking water, 'Flavored Water' and 'Glacier Water' are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, as they refer to different types of water with distinct characteristics.
  Flavored Water is typically water infused with natural or artificial flavors, while
  Glacier Water is water sourced from glaciers and has a distinct taste due to its
  natural minerals. Therefore, they should not be merged together. However, for a
  more detailed and accurate answer, it's best to consult a nutritionist or a water
  expert.
