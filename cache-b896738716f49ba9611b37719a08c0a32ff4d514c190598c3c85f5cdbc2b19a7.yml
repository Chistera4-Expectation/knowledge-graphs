  The two instances, "Shaoxing wine" and "Wine," are not exact duplicates. Shaoxing
  wine is a particular type of Chinese rice wine produced in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province,
  whereas Wine refers to an alcoholic drink made from fermented grapes. Although both
  contain alcohol, they have different ingredients, flavors, and cultural associations.
  Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate rather than merging them into
  one instance.'
