  While both "Green tea" and "Matcha green tea powder" are derived from the leaves
  of Camellia sinensis, they have different forms and preparation methods, which can
  result in distinct nutritional profiles and health benefits. Therefore, it is not
  appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
