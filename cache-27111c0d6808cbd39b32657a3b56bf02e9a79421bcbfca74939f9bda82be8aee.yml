text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  "Mineral Water" and "Water" refer to types of water, they have distinct properties
  and characteristics. Mineral Water contains dissolved minerals and trace elements,
  while regular water does not. Therefore, they should be considered separate entities
  in a dietician's classification.
