text: ' No. Greek seasoning and Italian seasoning are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, despite having some overlap in their ingredients. They have distinct
  combinations of herbs and spices that give each its unique flavor profile, making
  them appropriate for different cuisines. Merging these two instances would not accurately
  represent their unique identities and applications in cooking.'
