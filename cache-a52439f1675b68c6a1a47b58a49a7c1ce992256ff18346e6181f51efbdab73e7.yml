text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different types of leafy
  greens with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Basil leaves are an
  herb, while "other leafy greens" could encompass a variety of vegetables such as
  spinach, kale, and collard greens. Although they share some common characteristics,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
