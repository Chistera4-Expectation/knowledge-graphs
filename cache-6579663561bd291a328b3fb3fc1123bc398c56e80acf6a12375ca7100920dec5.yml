  While both "Greek Seasoning" and "Maggi Seasoning Cubes" are types of food seasonings,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct ingredients,
  flavors, uses, and cultural origins. Greek Seasoning typically includes herbs such
  as oregano, thyme, rosemary, and garlic, while Maggi Seasoning Cubes contain hydrolyzed
  vegetable protein, spices, flavor enhancers (such as monosodium glamate), and other
  additives to create their unique taste. Merging these two concepts would overlook
  significant differences between them.'
