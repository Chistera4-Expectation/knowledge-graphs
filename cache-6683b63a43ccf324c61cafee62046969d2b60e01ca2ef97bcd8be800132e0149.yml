  While both Kombucha tea and Matcha green tea powder are types of fermented teas,
  they have different preparation methods, taste profiles, and nutritional content.
  Kombucha is a fermented tea drink made by adding a symbiotic culture of bacteria
  and yeast to sweetened black or green tea, whereas matcha is a finely ground powder
  made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
