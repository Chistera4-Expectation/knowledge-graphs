  Fenugreek seeds (Trigonella foenum-graecum) and grape seeds (Vitis spp.) are distinct
  types of seeds that come from different plants with unique nutritional profiles
  and uses. They cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates. Here is
  some information on each:


  1. Fenugreek seeds - native to Western Asia and the Mediterranean region, fenugreek
  seeds have been used for centuries in traditional medicine and cooking. They contain
  various beneficial compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and saponins. Key health
  benefits include improved blood sugar control, reduced cholesterol levels, relief
  from inflammation, and increased milk production in breastfeeding women.

  2. Grape seeds - derived from grapes, these small seeds are rich in antioxidants
  like proanthocyanidins and vitamin E. They support heart health by improving circulation
  and reducing oxidative stress. Furthermore, they show promise in skin care due to
  their anti-inflammatory properties and potential collagen boosting effects.


  While both fenugreek seeds and grape seeds offer numerous health advantages, merging
  them as semantic or ontological duplicates would not accurately represent their
  differences and individual contributions to nutrition and wellness.'
