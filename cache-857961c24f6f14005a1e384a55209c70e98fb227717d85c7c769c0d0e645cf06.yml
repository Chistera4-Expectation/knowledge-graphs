text: No, Corn husks and Corn should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are related, Corn husks and Corn represent different parts
  of the plant and have different nutritional values and uses. Corn husks are the
  outer covering of the corn cob and are typically discarded, while Corn refers to
  the edible kernels on the cob.
