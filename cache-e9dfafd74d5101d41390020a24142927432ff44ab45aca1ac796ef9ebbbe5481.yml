  While cumin powder and white pepper powder are both types of spices and may have
  some similar uses in cooking, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantically,
  they represent different concepts with distinct flavors, appearances, and culinary
  applications. Ontologically, they belong to separate categories within the hierarchy
  of food ingredients. Therefore, it is appropriate for them to remain as separate
  instances.'
