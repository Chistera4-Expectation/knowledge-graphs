text: ' No. While both Crimini and Portobello mushrooms are types of edible fungi,
  they belong to different species and have distinct differences in terms of their
  appearance, taste, and nutritional content. Therefore, it is not appropriate to
  merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
