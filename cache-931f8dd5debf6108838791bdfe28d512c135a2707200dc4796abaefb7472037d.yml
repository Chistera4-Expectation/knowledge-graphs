text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both Quail Broth and Quail
  Meat are derived from quails, they are different food items with distinct nutritional
  values and properties. Quail Broth is a liquid, typically made by simmering quail
  meat, bones, and aromatics, while Quail Meat refers to the actual flesh of the quail
  bird. They should be kept as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
