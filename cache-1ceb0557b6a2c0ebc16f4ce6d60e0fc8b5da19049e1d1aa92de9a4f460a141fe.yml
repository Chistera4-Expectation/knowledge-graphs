text: ' No. While both "The base ingredient of the sauce" and "Fish sauce" may have
  some overlap in meaning, they are not exact duplicates. "The base ingredient of
  the sauce" is a general term that could refer to any number of ingredients used
  as a foundation for various sauces, while "Fish sauce" specifically refers to a
  type of condiment made from fermented fish. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
