text: ' No. Red pepper flakes and Scotch bonnet peppers are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, despite both being types of peppers. They have different taste profiles,
  heat levels, uses, and appearances. Therefore, it is important to maintain them
  as separate entities in a knowledge graph or any other organized data system.'
