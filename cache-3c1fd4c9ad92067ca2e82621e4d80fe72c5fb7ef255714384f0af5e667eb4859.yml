  While both olive oil and vegetable oil are types of edible oils, they have different
  properties, sources, and uses which make them distinct from one another. Olive oil
  is obtained exclusively from olives, while vegetable oil can be made from various
  plants such as soybeans, corn, sunflower seeds, etc. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge these two concepts as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
