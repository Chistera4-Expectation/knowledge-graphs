  While both "chicken pieces" and "grilled chicken" are types of poultry-derived food,
  they do not represent semantic and ontological dupes. The term "chicken pieces"
  is more generic and could refer to various cuts (e.g., breasts, thighs, wings) that
  may undergo different cooking methods. Meanwhile, "grilled chicken" refers specifically
  to chicken pieces cooked on a grill or with grilling techniques. Therefore, these
  two terms have distinct meanings within the context of poultry-derived foods.'
