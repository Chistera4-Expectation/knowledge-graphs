text: ' The most suitable category for "Optional Add-Ins" would be "Food Dressings,"
  as it allows for the widest variety of optional ingredients to enhance or modify
  the flavor and texture of various dishes. This can include sauces, spices, seasonings,
  and condiments. However, other categories such as "Honey," "Tea," and even some
  items under "Beverages" could also fit depending on the context.'
