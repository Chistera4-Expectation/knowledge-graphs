text: No, 'Duck Broth' and 'Duck Patties' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different types of poultry-derived food, with
  distinct nutritional profiles and preparation methods. Duck Broth is a liquid derived
  from cooking duck meat and bones, while Duck Patties are solid, ground duck meat
  patties, often used in dishes like burgers or meatballs.
