text: ' No. While long-grain rice and white rice are both types of rice, they have
  distinct characteristics that make them different from each other. Long-grain rice
  has a slender kernel with a length that is at least three times its width, resulting
  in separate grains when cooked. It tends to remain dry and fluffy even after cooking.
  On the other hand, white rice refers to any rice that has had its husk, bran, and
  germ removed during processing, giving it a bright white appearance. White rice
  can come in various grain sizes, including short-, medium-, and long-grain varieties.
  Therefore, merging these two terms as semantic and ontological duplicates would
  not accurately represent their differences.'
