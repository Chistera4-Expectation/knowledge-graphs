text: No, Onions and Scallions should not be merged together as they are distinct
  vegetables with different properties and uses in cooking. Although they are both
  members of the Allium genus, they have distinct appearances, flavors, and culinary
  applications. Onions are typically larger, have a stronger flavor, and are used
  in a wider range of dishes, while Scallions are milder in flavor and often used
  in raw preparations or as a garnish.
