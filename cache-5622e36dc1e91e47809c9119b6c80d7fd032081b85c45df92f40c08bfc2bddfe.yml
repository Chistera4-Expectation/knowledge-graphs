text: No, 'Ostrich Meatballs' and 'Pheasant Meatballs' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they both fall under the Poultry-derived
  Food class, they are made from different types of poultry, which can have distinct
  nutritional profiles and cooking properties. Therefore, they should be treated as
  separate instances within the category.
