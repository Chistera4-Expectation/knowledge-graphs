text: No, 'Oxygenated Water' and 'Tap Water' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the category of drinking water,
  they are distinct types of water with different properties and characteristics.
  Oxygenated water has added oxygen and is typically marketed for its potential health
  benefits, while tap water is water provided by municipal sources and is regulated
  by government agencies to ensure safety and potability.
