text: ' No. Groundnuts (also known as peanuts) are botanically classified as legumes,
  while other nuts such as almonds, walnuts, and pistachios are seeds of drupaceous
  fruits and belong to the family Rosaceae or other plant families. Although they
  may have similar nutritional profiles and uses in diets, groundnuts and other nuts
  represent different food categories from both a semantic and an ontological perspective
  due to their distinct taxonomical classification. Therefore, it is appropriate to
  keep them separate when discussing edible seeds in a dietary context.'
