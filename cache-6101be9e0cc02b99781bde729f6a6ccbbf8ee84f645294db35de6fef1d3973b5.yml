text: 'As a dietician, I can provide some insight into the nutritional aspects of
  coffee. However, when it comes to classifying coffee types based on their semantic
  and ontologic properties, it would be more appropriate to consult an expert in that
  field, such as a linguist or a computer scientist.


  That being said, in terms of nutrition, Turkish coffee and strong coffee may have
  similarities, but they are not necessarily the same thing. Turkish coffee is prepared
  using finely ground coffee beans, boiled in a special pot called a cezve or ibrik,
  and served unfiltered. Strong coffee, on the other hand, can refer to any brewing
  method that produces a more concentrated coffee, such as espresso or French press
  coffee.


  From a dietary perspective, the main nutritional differences between the two would
  be the concentration of caffeine, which may vary depending on the brewing method
  and the type of coffee beans used. In general, both types of coffee can provide
  health benefits when consumed in moderation, such as antioxidants and improved mental
  alertness. However, excessive caffeine intake can lead to negative health effects,
  such as increased heart rate, anxiety, and insomnia.


  To summarize, while Turkish coffee and strong coffee may share some similarities,
  they are not necessarily semantic or ontologic duplicates. From a dietary standpoint,
  they can have similar nutritional properties but may differ in their caffeine content.'
