  While pumpkin seeds and watermelon seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. It is important to maintain
  separate listings for each type of seed to accurately represent their unique characteristics
  and provide clear information to consumers.'
