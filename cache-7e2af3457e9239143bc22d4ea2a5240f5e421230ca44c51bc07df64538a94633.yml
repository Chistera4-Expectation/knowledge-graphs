  Raspberry honey and strawberry honey are two distinct types of flavored honeys that
  should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they may share
  some similarities as flavored honeys, they have different taste profiles due to
  their unique ingredients - raspberries vs strawberries. Therefore, it is important
  to distinguish between them for accurate food labeling, recipe creation, and consumer
  understanding.'
