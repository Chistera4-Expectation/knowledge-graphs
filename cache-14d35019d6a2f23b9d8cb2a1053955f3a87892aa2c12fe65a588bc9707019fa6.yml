  Lean beef and beef back ribs are not semantic or ontological duplicates, as they
  refer to distinct cuts of beef with different nutritional profiles. Lean beef is
  typically taken from parts of the animal that have less marbling (fat), making it
  lower in calories and fat compared to other cuts like beef back ribs. On the other
  hand, beef back ribs contain more connective tissue and fat, leading to higher calorie
  and fat content per serving than lean beef. Therefore, merging these two instances
  would not accurately represent their unique properties and uses within the context
  of nutrition and cooking.'
