text: No, Pumpkin Seed Oil and Sesame Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible vegetal oils, they come from different
  plant sources (pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds, respectively) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles and flavors. They serve different purposes in cooking and may be used in
  different recipes.
