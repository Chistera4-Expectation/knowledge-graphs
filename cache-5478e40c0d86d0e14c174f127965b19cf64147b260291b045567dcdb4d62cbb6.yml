text: No, they should not be merged. Sushi Rice and Wild Rice are different types
  of rice with distinct characteristics and uses in cuisine. Sushi Rice is a short-grain
  rice that is sticky when cooked and typically used in Japanese cuisine, while Wild
  Rice is a long-grain, nutty-flavored rice that grows in North America and is often
  used in dishes for its heartiness and texture. Although both are types of rice,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
