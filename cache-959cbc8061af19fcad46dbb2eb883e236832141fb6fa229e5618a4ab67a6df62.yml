text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinctly different ingredients
  and flavor profiles. Curry powder typically contains a blend of spices such as turmeric,
  coriander, cumin, and chili powder, while Five Spice Powder consists of star anise,
  cloves, cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds. Although both are used for seasoning,
  they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates due to their unique compositions and
  uses.
