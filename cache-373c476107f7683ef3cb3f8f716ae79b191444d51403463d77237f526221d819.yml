text: No, the instances 'Juice' and 'Pomegranate juice' should not be merged as they
  are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Juice' is a general term referring to
  any liquid extracted from fruits or vegetables, while 'Pomegranate juice' is a specific
  type of juice made from pomegranates. They are related but distinct entities.
