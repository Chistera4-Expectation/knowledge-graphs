text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both duck meatballs and quail meatballs are meatballs derived from poultry,
  they are made from different types of poultry and may have distinct nutritional
  profiles, flavors, and cooking methods. Therefore, they should be considered separate
  instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
