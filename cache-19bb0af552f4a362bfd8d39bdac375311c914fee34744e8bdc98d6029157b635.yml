text: 'As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional differences between
  the two, but the decision on merging them as duplicates would be more appropriate
  for an ontology expert. However, from a nutritional perspective, they are not duplicates.


  Butter Blend typically consists of a mixture of butter and plant-based oils, such
  as olive oil or canola oil. This combination can provide a balance of saturated
  and unsaturated fats.


  Plant-based Butter, on the other hand, is made entirely from plant-based ingredients,
  such as coconut oil, palm oil, or vegetable oils. This type of butter is completely
  free of animal products, making it suitable for vegans or those with lactose intolerance.


  While both Butter Blend and Plant-based Butter can be used as alternatives to traditional
  butter, they have distinct nutritional profiles and are not exact duplicates.'
