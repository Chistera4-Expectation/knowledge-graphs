text: As a dietician, my answer would be yes, the instances 'Ground beef' and 'Ground
  meat' can be considered semantic and ontological duplicates. 'Ground beef' refers
  to beef that has been finely chopped or minced, while 'Ground meat' is a more general
  term referring to any type of meat that has been ground. However, in the context
  of the Beef class, it would make sense to merge them together as they are essentially
  the same concept in this specific context.
