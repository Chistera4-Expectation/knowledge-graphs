text: No, the instances 'Vegetable Broth' and 'Vegetables of your choice' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct entities
  within the Edible Vegetable class. 'Vegetable Broth' refers to a specific type of
  liquid, while 'Vegetables of your choice' refers to a variety of vegetables that
  a person can select. They are not duplicates but rather different types of edible
  vegetables.
