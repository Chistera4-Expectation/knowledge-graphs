text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Electrolyte
  Water and Tap Water have distinct characteristics and properties. Electrolyte Water
  typically contains added minerals and electrolytes for hydration purposes, while
  Tap Water is sourced from municipal water supplies and undergoes treatment before
  distribution. Although they both fall under the category of drinking water, they
  have unique features that warrant separate instances.
