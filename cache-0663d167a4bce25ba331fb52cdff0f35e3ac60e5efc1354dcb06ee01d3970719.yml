text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of spices, they
  have distinct properties, flavors, and uses in cooking. Black pepper is a common
  spice used for its pungent flavor and aroma, while Scotch Bonnet Peppers are hot
  chili peppers with a fruity flavor and used for their heat. These differences make
  them separate entities in terms of semantics and ontology.
