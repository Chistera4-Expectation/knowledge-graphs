text: 'As a dietician, my role is to provide information and advice related to food
  and nutrition. In terms of the Sweetener class and the instances ''Lactose'' and
  ''Maltose'', they are not semantic or ontological duplicates, as they are two different
  types of sugars.


  Lactose is a disaccharide sugar found in milk and dairy products. It is composed
  of glucose and galactose. Maltose, on the other hand, is also a disaccharide sugar
  but is found in grains, particularly in germinating grains. It is composed of two
  glucose molecules.


  While both Lactose and Maltose are types of sugars and can be classified as sweeteners,
  they have different chemical structures, sources, and uses. Therefore, they should
  not be merged together as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
