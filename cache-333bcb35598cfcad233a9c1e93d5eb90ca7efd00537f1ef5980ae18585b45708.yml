text: " No. Tomatoes are whole fruits that can be eaten fresh or cooked, while tomato\
  \ paste is a concentrated, cooked pur\xE9e of tomatoes. Although they come from\
  \ the same fruit, they have different culinary uses and nutritional profiles due\
  \ to processing methods. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as\
  \ semantic and ontological duplicates."
