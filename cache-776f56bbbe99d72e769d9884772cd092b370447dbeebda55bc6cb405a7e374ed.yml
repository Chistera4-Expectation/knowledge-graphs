text: No, they should not be merged. While both are types of rice, they have distinct
  characteristics and uses. Glutinous rice is sticky and used in dishes like sushi
  and desserts, while long-grain rice is less sticky and used in dishes like pilafs
  and stir-fries. Merging them would lose this important information.
