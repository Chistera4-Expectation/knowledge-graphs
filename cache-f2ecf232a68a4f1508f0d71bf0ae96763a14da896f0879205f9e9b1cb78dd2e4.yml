text: As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspects of rice
  but not on the semantic and ontological categorization. However, from a nutritional
  standpoint, Japonica Rice and Sushi Rice are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  While both are short-grain rice varieties, they have slight differences in texture
  and starch content, which may affect their culinary use. Japonica Rice has a higher
  amylose content and is stickier, making it ideal for sushi and other Japanese dishes.
  Sushi Rice is typically prepared with vinegar, sugar, and salt to create a specific
  flavor profile for sushi.
