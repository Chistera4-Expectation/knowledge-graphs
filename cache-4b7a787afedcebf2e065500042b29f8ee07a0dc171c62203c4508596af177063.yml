  While both carbohydrates and sodium are nutrients found in cheese, they serve different
  functions in the body and have different health implications. Carbohydrates provide
  energy to the body, while sodium helps regulate fluid balance and nerve function.
  Therefore, it is important to track each of these nutrients separately for nutrition
  analysis purposes.


  Furthermore, from an ontological perspective, carbohydrates and sodium belong to
  different categories: carbohydrates are classified as sugars or starches, whereas
  sodium is a mineral and electrolyte. Merging them into one attribute would not accurately
  reflect their distinct roles and properties.'
