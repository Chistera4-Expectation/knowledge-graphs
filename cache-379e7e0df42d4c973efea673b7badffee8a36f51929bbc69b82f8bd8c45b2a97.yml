text: ' No. While both "fiber per serving" and "saturated fat per serving" are nutritional
  facts related to cheese, they measure different things and serve distinct purposes
  in characterizing the food. Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for
  digestive health, while saturated fat is a type of fat that can contribute to heart
  disease when consumed in excess. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two properties as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
