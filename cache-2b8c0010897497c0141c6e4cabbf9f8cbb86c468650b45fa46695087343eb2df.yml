text: No, the instances 'Chanterelle Mushroom' and 'White Button Mushroom' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct
  species of edible mushrooms with different characteristics, appearances, and nutritional
  profiles. Merging them would result in a loss of valuable information and categorization.
