  While both "Pork fat" and "Pork loin" are related to pork, they refer to different
  parts of the animal and have distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Pork fat typically refers to the adipose tissue found on pigs, which is high in
  calories and saturated fats. On the other hand, Pork loin comes from the back of
  the pig and is generally considered a leaner cut with less fat content compared
  to other cuts like pork belly or pork ribs. Merging these two terms would result
  in loss of important distinctions between their nutritional values and culinary
  uses.'
