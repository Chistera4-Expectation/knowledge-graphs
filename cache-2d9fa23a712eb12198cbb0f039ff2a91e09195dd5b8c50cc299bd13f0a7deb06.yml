text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  they both come from the same animal (ostrich), they are different products with
  distinct nutritional compositions and culinary uses. Ostrich gizzards are a specific
  part of the bird, while ostrich sausage is a processed food made from ground ostrich
  meat.
