  Although chia seeds and mustard seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  different nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and botanical origins. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Here is some more information about each type of seed:


  * Chia seeds come from the Salvia hispanica plant, which is native to Mexico and
  Central America. They are high in fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and
  minerals like calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. Chia seeds can be used as a thickener
  in cooking and baking, added to smoothies for extra nutrition, or sprinkled on top
  of yogurt or oatmeal for crunch.

  * Mustard seeds come from various species of Brassica plants, including black mustard
  (Brassica nigra), brown mustard (Brassica juncea), and white mustard (Sinapis alba).
  These seeds contain oil, protein, and fiber, as well as compounds that give them
  their pungent flavor. Mustard seeds are often ground into powder and mixed with
  water, vinegar, or other liquids to make prepared mustards. They can also be used
  whole in pickling recipes or as a spice in Indian cuisine.


  As you can see, chia seeds and mustard seeds serve different purposes in food preparation
  and offer distinct health benefits. Merging these two concepts would lead to confusion
  and misinformation, so it''s important to keep them separate when discussing edible
  seeds.'
