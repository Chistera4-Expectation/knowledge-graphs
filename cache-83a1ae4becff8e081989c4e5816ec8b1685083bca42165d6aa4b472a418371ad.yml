  While French dressing and Poppy Seed dressing may belong to the same category of
  food (i.e., salad dressings), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantically,
  they have different meanings, ingredients, and uses. Ontologically, they refer to
  distinct entities with unique properties and characteristics. Merging them would
  result in loss of important distinctions between these two types of dressings.'
