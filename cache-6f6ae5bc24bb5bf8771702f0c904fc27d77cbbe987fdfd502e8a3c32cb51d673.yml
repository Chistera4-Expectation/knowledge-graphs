text: No, Soy Milk and Whole Milk should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they both fall under the general category of "Milk," they have
  distinct nutritional compositions and properties, and therefore, they serve different
  dietary purposes and should be treated as separate entities in a dietary context.
