text: No, "Guinea Fowl Gravy" and "Guinea Fowl Wings" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from Guinea Fowl,
  they are distinct food items with different properties and uses. "Guinea Fowl Gravy"
  is a sauce made from the cooking juices of the bird, while "Guinea Fowl Wings" are
  the wings of the bird that can be prepared and served as a separate dish.
