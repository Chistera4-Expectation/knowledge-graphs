text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are edible vegetal oils, they are derived from different sources and have distinct
  nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses. Macadamia Nut Oil and Pumpkin Seed Oil
  should be treated as separate entities in a classification system.
