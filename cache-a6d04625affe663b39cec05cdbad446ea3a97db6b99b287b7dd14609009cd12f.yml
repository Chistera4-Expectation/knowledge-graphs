text: No, "Duck Drumsticks" and "Duck Patties" should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. They are different types of poultry-derived food, with distinct
  preparation methods and forms. Duck Drumsticks are a specific cut from the duck
  leg, while Duck Patties are usually made from ground duck meat shaped into patties.
  Although both are derived from ducks, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
