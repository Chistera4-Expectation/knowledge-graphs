text: No, they should not be merged together. Although "Dry white wine" is a specific
  type of wine, it has different properties and characteristics compared to wine in
  general. For example, dry white wine has a lower sugar content and specific flavor
  profiles compared to other types of wine. Merging them would not accurately represent
  the nuances and differences between the two.
