text: No, Dandelion Honey and Pine Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of honey, with distinct flavors,
  textures, and nutritional profiles due to their unique origins and processing methods.
  Maintaining separate instances allows for accurate representation of these differences
  in a knowledge base or database.
