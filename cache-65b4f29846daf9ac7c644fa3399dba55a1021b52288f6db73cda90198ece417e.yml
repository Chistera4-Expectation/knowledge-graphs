  While French dressing and ranch dressing may have some similarities as salad dressings,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct ingredients,
  flavors, textures, and cultural origins that make them unique from one another.
  Merging these two concepts would result in loss of important distinctions between
  them, which could lead to confusion for users seeking information about either type
  of dressing. Therefore, it is best to keep them separate within the food dressing
  classification system.'
