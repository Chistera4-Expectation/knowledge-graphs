text: No, Arborio Rice and Forbidden Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have distinct
  characteristics, nutritional values, and uses in cooking. Arborio Rice is an Italian
  short-grain rice often used in risotto, while Forbidden Rice, also known as black
  rice, is a whole grain rice with a nutty flavor and higher nutritional content,
  often used in salads, pilafs, and desserts.
