text: No, "Duck Stock" and "Turkey Stock" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both stocks derived from poultry, they
  have distinct flavors and nutritional profiles due to the differences in the types
  of poultry used. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances in the
  Poultry-derived Food class.
