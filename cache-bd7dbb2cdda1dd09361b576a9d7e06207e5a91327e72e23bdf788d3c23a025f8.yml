text: ' For "other fillings" that are not specifically mentioned in the given list,
  I would suggest using the class name "Miscellaneous Foods" or "Other Edibles". This
  category could include items like "Food Dressing", "Sauce", and other condiments.
  However, if we want to focus on edible items that can be used as fillers in various
  dishes, then "Edible Condiments" might be an appropriate class name. But remember,
  this is just a suggestion based on the context provided. The exact classification
  may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project or research.'
