text: No, the instances 'Onion slices' and 'Tomato slices' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both slices of edible vegetables,
  they are distinctly different vegetables with different nutritional profiles, flavors,
  and uses in cooking. Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and clarity
  in the classification system.
