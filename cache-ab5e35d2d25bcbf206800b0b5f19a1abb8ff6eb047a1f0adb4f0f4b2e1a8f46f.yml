text: ' No. Basil leaves and curry leaves are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of leaves used for flavoring food. They come from different
  plants (Ocimum basilicum and Murraya koenigii, respectively), have distinct appearances,
  tastes, and uses in cooking. Therefore, they should remain separate instances within
  the Edible Vegetable class.'
