text: ' No. While Caesar Dressing and Olive Oil Dressing are similar in that they
  can both be used as dressings and olive oil is an ingredient in some Caesar Dressing
  recipes, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Caesar Dressing has specific
  ingredients and preparation methods distinct from those of Olive Oil Dressing.'
