text: No, these two instances are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are
  two different types of sauces with distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses. Tempura
  Dipping Sauce is typically made with ingredients like soy sauce, mirin, and sugar,
  while Tomato sauce usually consists of tomatoes, herbs, and spices. Merging them
  would not accurately represent their unique characteristics and purposes.
