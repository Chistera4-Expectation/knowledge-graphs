text: No, they should not be merged. While both terms relate to seasoning, 'Additional
  seasonings' suggests a category of supplementary seasoning options, whereas 'seasoning'
  is a more general term referring to the act or process of enhancing food flavor
  with spices, herbs, or other ingredients. Maintaining the distinction between them
  helps to clarify their specific meanings and roles in a food context.
