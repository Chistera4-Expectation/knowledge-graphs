  While sunflower seeds and watermelon seeds are both types of edible seeds, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct characteristics,
  nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Sunflower seeds are typically larger, have
  a mildly nutty flavor, and are high in vitamin E, magnesium, and selenium. They
  can be eaten raw, roasted, or used as an ingredient in various dishes such as breads,
  salads, and granolas. On the other hand, watermelon seeds are smaller, often removed
  from the fruit before eating, but when consumed, provide benefits like magnesium,
  iron, and folate. They can also be roasted and seasoned for a snack, although their
  use is less common than that of sunflower seeds. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances as semantic or ontological duplicates since they represent
  separate food items with unique properties and applications.'
