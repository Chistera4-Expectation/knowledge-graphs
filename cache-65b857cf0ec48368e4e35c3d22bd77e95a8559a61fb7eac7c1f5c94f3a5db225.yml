text: No, they should not be merged. While collard greens are indeed a type of leafy
  green, they are a specific variety with distinct characteristics. Merging them with
  "other leafy greens" would result in a loss of specificity and potentially confuse
  users. It's essential to maintain the distinction between specific types of leafy
  greens and the broader category of "other leafy greens" to provide accurate information
  to users.
