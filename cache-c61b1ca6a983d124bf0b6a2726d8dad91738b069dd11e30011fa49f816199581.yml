  Although both Cherry Blossom Honey and Tupelo Honey are types of honey, they come
  from different floral sources which can affect their taste, color, aroma, and other
  properties. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Each type of honey has its unique characteristics that may
  matter to consumers for various reasons such as flavor preferences, nutritional
  content, or specific health benefits associated with certain flower nectars.'
