text: " No.\n\nAlmond milk and buttermilk are not semantic or ontological duplicates\
  \ despite both being types of milk. Almond milk is a plant-based milk made from\
  \ almonds, while buttermilk is a fermented dairy product typically made from cow\u2019\
  s milk. They have different nutritional profiles, ingredients, and uses, making\
  \ them distinct entities that warrant separate classification."
