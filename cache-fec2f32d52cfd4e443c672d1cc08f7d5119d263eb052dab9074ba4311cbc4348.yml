text: ' Neither coffee nor tea are classes for an iron infusion. An iron infusion
  is a medical procedure where iron is administered intravenously to address iron
  deficiency or other conditions that require increased iron levels in the body. Therefore,
  there isn''t an appropriate answer to your question as both coffee and tea are beverages
  and not classes related to iron infusions.'
