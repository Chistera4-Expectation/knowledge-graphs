text: No, the instances 'Grilled Bread' and 'Sourdough Bread' should not be merged
  together as they represent different types of bread. 'Grilled Bread' refers to a
  preparation method, while 'Sourdough Bread' refers to a specific type of bread made
  with a sourdough starter. Merging them would create confusion and not accurately
  represent the differences between these types of bread.
