text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. While both 'Juice' and 'Orange juice'
  are related, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Juice' is a general
  term for a drink made by extracting the natural liquid from fruits or vegetables,
  whereas 'Orange juice' specifically refers to a juice made from oranges. They have
  distinct characteristics, nutritional values, and preparation methods, so they should
  not be merged together.
