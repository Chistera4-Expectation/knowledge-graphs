text: As a dietician, my focus is on the nutritional aspects of sauces rather than
  their classification. However, from a semantic and ontological perspective, Chili
  sauce and Mole sauce are not duplicates, as they have different ingredients and
  flavor profiles. Chili sauce typically consists of chili peppers, vinegar, and spices,
  while Mole sauce is a complex sauce with a base of chili peppers, nuts, seeds, and
  spices, often combined with chocolate or cocoa. Therefore, the answer is no, they
  should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
