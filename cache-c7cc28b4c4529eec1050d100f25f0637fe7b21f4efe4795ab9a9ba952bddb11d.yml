text: No, Pheasant Broth and Quail Broth should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both broths derived from poultry, they
  come from different types of birds and may have slightly different nutritional profiles
  and flavor characteristics. It is important to maintain the distinction between
  them in a comprehensive dietary classification system.
