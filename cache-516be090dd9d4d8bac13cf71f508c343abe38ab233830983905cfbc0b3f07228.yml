text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Pickled
  mustard greens and other leafy greens are distinct types of vegetables, even though
  they both fall under the category of leafy greens. Pickled mustard greens are a
  specific type of mustard greens that have been pickled, while other leafy greens
  encompass a broader range of leafy green vegetables, such as spinach, kale, and
  collard greens. Although they share similar nutritional properties, they are not
  semantically or ontologically the same.
