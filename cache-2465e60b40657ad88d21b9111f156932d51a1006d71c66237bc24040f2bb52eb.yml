  While both are derived from quail, they are different types of food products with
  distinct nutritional values and culinary uses. Quail Meatballs are a dish made from
  ground quail meat, while Quail Stock is a liquid obtained from simmering quail bones,
  connective tissue, and aromatic vegetables to make a flavorful base for soups and
  sauces.
