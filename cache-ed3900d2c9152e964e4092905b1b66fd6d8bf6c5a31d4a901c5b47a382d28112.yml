text: ' No. Calories per serving and Vitamin A content per serving are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. While both provide information about the nutritional
  value of cheese, they measure different aspects: energy content (calories) versus
  specific vitamin content (Vitamin A). Therefore, it is important to keep them separate
  for clarity and accuracy in providing nutrition information.'
