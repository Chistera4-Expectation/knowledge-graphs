  Although acacia honey and linden honey can both be classified under the broader
  category of "honey," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have
  distinct botanical origins (acacia tree vs. lime tree), flavors, colors, and properties
  that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate
  identities for these two types of honey.'
