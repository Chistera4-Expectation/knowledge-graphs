text: No, the instances 'Flying fish' and 'Sashimi-grade fish' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of edible fish,
  they are distinct species and have different characteristics, such as taste, texture,
  and usage in cuisine. 'Flying fish' is a specific type of fish with unique characteristics
  like gliding through the air, while 'Sashimi-grade fish' is a classification based
  on the quality and freshness of the fish suitable for sashimi preparation.
