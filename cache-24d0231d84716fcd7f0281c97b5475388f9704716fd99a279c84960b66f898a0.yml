text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  "Pheasant Meatballs" and "Pheasant" involve poultry-derived food, they are distinct
  entities. "Pheasant" refers to the whole bird, while "Pheasant Meatballs" is a specific
  preparation of the meat. They are related but not duplicates.
