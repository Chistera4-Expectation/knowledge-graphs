text: ' The most adequate class for ground nutmeg would be "Spice". Nutmeg is a spice
  that comes from the seed of the nutmeg tree and is commonly used to add flavor to
  various dishes, including baked goods, soups, and beverages. It does not fit into
  any of the other categories you have listed as it is not an alcoholic drink, meat
  product (beef, pork-derived food, poultry-derived food), grain-based food (bread,
  pasta types, rice), dairy product (butter, milk, cheese, yogurt), sweetened beverage
  (energy drink, juice, soda), or water.'
