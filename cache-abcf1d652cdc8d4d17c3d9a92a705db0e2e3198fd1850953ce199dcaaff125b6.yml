text: No, 'Ceylon Tea' and 'Green Tea' should not be merged together as they are different
  types of tea with distinct characteristics and origins. Ceylon Tea refers to tea
  produced in Sri Lanka, while Green Tea refers to tea that is processed without oxidation,
  resulting in a lighter color and milder taste. Although they are both types of tea,
  they have unique properties and should not be merged as duplicates.
