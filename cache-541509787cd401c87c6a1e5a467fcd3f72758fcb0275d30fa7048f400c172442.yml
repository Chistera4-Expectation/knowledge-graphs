text: No, they should not be merged. Although both dill pickles and pickles are related
  and contain similar ingredients, they are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Dill pickles refer specifically to pickles made with dill herb, while pickles can
  refer to a variety of pickled vegetables, not just those made with dill. Therefore,
  they represent distinct concepts within the Edible Vegetable class.
