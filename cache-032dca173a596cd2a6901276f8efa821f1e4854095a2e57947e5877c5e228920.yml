  Camel milk is a specific type of milk from camels, while lactose-free milk is a
  category of milk that has had the lactose removed or reduced, which can include
  various types of milk like cow's milk or goat's milk. They are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, as they represent different types of milk with unique properties.
