text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Cultured
  butter and spreadable butter are two distinct types of butter with different production
  processes and characteristics. Cultured butter is made from fermented cream, giving
  it a tangy flavor, while spreadable butter typically has added oils or other ingredients
  to make it softer and easier to spread at room temperature. Therefore, they should
  remain as separate instances in the Butter class.
