  While almond milk and other plant-based milks like oat milk are alternative "milk"
  options that can serve similar purposes in a person''s diet, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, taste, texture, and production
  methods. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate from a semantic and
  ontological standpoint. This allows for more precise categorization, comparison,
  and understanding of these various food items.'
