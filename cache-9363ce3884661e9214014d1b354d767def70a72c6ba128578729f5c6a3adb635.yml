  While both duck and pheasant are types of poultry, they are different species with
  distinct characteristics and flavor profiles. Therefore, 'Duck Meatballs' and 'Pheasant
  Meatballs' represent distinct food items and should be treated as separate instances
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.
