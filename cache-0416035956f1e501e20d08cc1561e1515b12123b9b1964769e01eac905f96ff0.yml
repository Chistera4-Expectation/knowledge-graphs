text: No, Enoki Mushroom and Morel Mushroom should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both edible mushrooms, they have distinct
  characteristics, appearances, and nutritional profiles. Merging them would result
  in loss of valuable information and confusion in the classification of these different
  mushroom varieties.
