text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both are derived from duck, they are different food items with distinct characteristics
  and uses in culinary applications. Duck sausage is a processed meat product, while
  duck refers to the entire bird. They may share some nutritional properties, but
  they are not the same food item.
