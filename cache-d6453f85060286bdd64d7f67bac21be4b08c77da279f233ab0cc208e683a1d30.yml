  While avocado dressing and honey mustard dressing may have some similarities as
  food dressings, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have
  distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses. Avocado dressing is typically made with
  mashed avocados, oil, vinegar or lemon juice, and seasonings, while honey mustard
  dressing is made with mustard, honey, mayo or oil, and often includes other ingredients
  like vinegar or lemon juice for acidity. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances as they represent different culinary options.'
