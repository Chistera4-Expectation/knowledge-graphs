text: ' No. Coconut oil and sesame oil are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they are both types of edible vegetable oils, they have different nutritional
  profiles, chemical compositions, culinary uses, and sources. Therefore, it is important
  to distinguish between them rather than merging their identities.'
