text: No. Although both Grapefruit juice and Pomegranate juice are types of fruit
  juices, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They are distinct types
  of fruit juices with their own unique nutritional profiles, flavors, and potential
  health benefits. Merging them together would not accurately represent the variety
  of fruit juices available and would not allow for the specific analysis of their
  individual nutritional values.
