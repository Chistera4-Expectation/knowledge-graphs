text: No, Dungeness Crab and Porcelain Crab should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible crustaceans, they belong to different
  families and have distinct characteristics. Dungeness Crab is a large crab found
  on the Pacific Coast of North America, while Porcelain Crab is a small, flattened
  crab found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Merging them would result
  in the loss of important taxonomic and ecological information.
