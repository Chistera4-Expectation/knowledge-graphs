text: ' No, these two instances should not be merged as they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Grass-fed beef and ground beef refer to different aspects of beef production
  and consumption. Grass-fed beef refers to how cattle have been raised, while ground
  beef describes a specific cut and preparation of meat. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to keep them separate.'
