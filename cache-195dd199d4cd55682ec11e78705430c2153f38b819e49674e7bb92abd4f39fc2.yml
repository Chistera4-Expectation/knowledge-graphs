text: ' No. Creamed honey and heather honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  they refer to different types of honey products with unique characteristics. Creamed
  honey is honey that has been processed to control crystallization, resulting in
  a smooth spreadable texture, while heather honey is a type of honey produced from
  nectar collected from heather plants and tends to have a strong flavor.'
