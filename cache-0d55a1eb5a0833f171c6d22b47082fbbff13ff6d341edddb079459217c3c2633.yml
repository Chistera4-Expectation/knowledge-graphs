text: No, Arborio Rice and Jasmine Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have distinct characteristics,
  uses, and flavors. Arborio Rice is an Italian short-grain rice, commonly used in
  risotto dishes, while Jasmine Rice is a long-grain, fragrant rice originating from
  Thailand, often used in Asian cuisine. They have different nutritional profiles
  and cooking methods, and therefore should not be considered as duplicates.
