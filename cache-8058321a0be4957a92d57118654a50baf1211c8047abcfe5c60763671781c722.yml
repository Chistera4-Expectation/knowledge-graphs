  While coconut oil and grapeseed oil may share some common properties as types of
  edible vegetable oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they
  come from different sources (coconuts vs grapes) and have unique nutritional profiles
  with distinct uses in cooking and other applications. Therefore, it is important
  to maintain them as separate instances within the category of edible vegetable oils.'
