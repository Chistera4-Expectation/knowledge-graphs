  Oolong tea and Rooibos tea are two different types of teas with distinct origins,
  flavors, and nutritional profiles. Oolong tea is a partially fermented tea that
  comes from China, while Rooibos tea is a caffeine-free herbal tea that comes from
  South Africa. They have different antioxidant compositions and health benefits,
  so it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
