text: As a dietician, I can provide input on the nutritional aspects of the coffees,
  but the decision to merge or not merge the instances in the Coffee class is primarily
  a concern of ontology and software development. However, considering the fact that
  "Vienna Coffee" and "strong coffee" may have different ingredients and preparation
  methods, they might not be considered exact duplicates. It would be beneficial to
  retain both instances for accuracy and clarity. The decision ultimately depends
  on the specific context and requirements of the Coffee class.
