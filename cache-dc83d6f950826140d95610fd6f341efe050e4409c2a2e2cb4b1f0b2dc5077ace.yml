text: No, "Quail Gizzards" and "Quail Stock" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are different food items derived from quails, with
  distinct nutritional values and uses in cooking. Quail Gizzards are a muscle tissue,
  while Quail Stock is a liquid made by simmering quail bones and/or other parts in
  water to create a flavorful broth.
