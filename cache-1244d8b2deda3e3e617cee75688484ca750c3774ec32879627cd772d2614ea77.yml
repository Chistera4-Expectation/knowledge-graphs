text: ' "Food Additive (specifically, Nitrites)": This is the most appropriate and
  accurate classification for nitrites as they are not strictly considered a dressing,
  seasoning, sauce, spice, or sweetener. They function more like food additives that
  provide preservation, color enhancement, and flavor to various foods.'
