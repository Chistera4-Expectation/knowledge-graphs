text: No, they should not be merged as they are not exact duplicates. Although they
  are both derived from chicken and share similarities, they have different consistencies,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Chicken broth is a liquid made by simmering chicken
  bones, meat, and vegetables, while chicken gravy is a thicker sauce made from the
  drippings of cooked chicken and a thickening agent like flour or cornstarch.
