text: No, Greek Yogurt and Vegan Yogurt should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of yogurt, they have distinct differences
  in terms of ingredients, production methods, and nutritional profiles. Greek Yogurt
  is made from dairy products, often with a higher protein content and thicker consistency,
  while Vegan Yogurt is made from plant-based alternatives such as soy, coconut, or
  almond milk, and is suitable for individuals following a vegan or lactose-free diet.
