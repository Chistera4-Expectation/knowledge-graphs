text: 'No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both Purified Water and Spring Water are types of drinking water, they have
  distinct differences in their production processes and sources.


  Purified Water is water that has been mechanically filtered or processed to remove
  impurities and make it suitable for consumption. It can come from various sources,
  such as tap water or groundwater, and undergo different purification methods like
  reverse osmosis, distillation, or deionization.


  Spring Water, on the other hand, is water that naturally flows to the earth''s surface
  from a clean underground source. It is often considered to have a more natural taste
  due to its mineral content. Spring water must be collected only at the spring or
  through a borehole that taps the underground formation feeding the spring.


  Although both types of water can be consumed, they are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates, as they have different characteristics and production processes.'
