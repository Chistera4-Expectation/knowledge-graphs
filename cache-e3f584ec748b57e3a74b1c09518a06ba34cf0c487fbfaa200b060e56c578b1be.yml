text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct sources and characteristics.
  Spring-fed water comes from underground springs and is naturally filtered, while
  well water is extracted from underground aquifers and may require additional treatment.
  Although they both originate from underground sources, they are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates due to their differences in origin and properties.
