  While both cooked rice and sushi rice are types of prepared rice, they have different
  culinary uses and may undergo distinct preparation processes. Cooked rice typically
  refers to steamed or boiled grains that serve as a staple food in many cultures,
  while sushi rice is specifically seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt for use
  in Japanese cuisine, particularly in making sushi rolls or dishes like sashimi.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates due to their unique properties and applications.'
