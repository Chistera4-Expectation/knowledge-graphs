text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Creamy Yogurt' and 'Yogurt'
  are types of yogurt, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct
  variations of yogurt with different characteristics. 'Creamy Yogurt' specifically
  refers to a yogurt with a smoother and creamier texture, while 'Yogurt' is a broader
  term encompassing all types of yogurt, including those with different textures and
  flavors.
