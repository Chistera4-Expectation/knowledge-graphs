text: No, 'Pork Cutlet' and 'Pork Shoulder' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from pork, they are different
  cuts of meat with distinct characteristics, preparation methods, and uses in cooking.
  They have unique nutritional profiles and should be treated as separate instances
  in a dietician's food classification system.
