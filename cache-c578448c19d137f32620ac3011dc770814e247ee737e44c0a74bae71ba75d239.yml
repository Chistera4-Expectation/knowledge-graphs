text: No, Chicken Liver and Chicken Tenders should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are derived from poultry (chicken), they are different cuts
  of meat with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Chicken Liver is
  an organ meat, rich in iron and vitamins, while Chicken Tenders are a cut of breast
  meat, lean and typically used for quick cooking methods. Merging them together would
  not accurately represent the differences in their properties and uses.
