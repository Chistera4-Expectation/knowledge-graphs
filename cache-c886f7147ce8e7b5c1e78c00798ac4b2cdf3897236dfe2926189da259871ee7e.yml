text: ' No. Long-grain rice and wild rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. Although they share the commonality of being
  types of rice, they differ significantly in their physical characteristics, taste,
  nutritional profiles, growth process, and geographical origins. Therefore, it is
  essential to maintain them as separate categories for accurate identification and
  understanding of each variety''s unique properties.'
