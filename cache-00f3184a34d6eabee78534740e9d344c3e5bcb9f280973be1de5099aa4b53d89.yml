text: No, "Plain Yogurt" and "Whole Milk Yogurt" should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both are types of yogurt, they have different
  characteristics. Plain yogurt can be made with whole milk, low-fat milk, or skim
  milk, while Whole Milk Yogurt specifically refers to yogurt made with whole milk.
  The nutritional content and fat content of these two types of yogurt will differ
  due to the type of milk used.
