text: No, the instances 'Cuban bread' and 'Flaxseed Bread' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of bread, they
  have distinct ingredients and characteristics that differentiate them from each
  other. Merging them would result in a loss of specific information about each type
  of bread.
