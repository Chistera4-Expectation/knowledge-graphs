text: ' No. Creamy Italian Dressing and Teriyaki Dressing are two distinct types of
  salad dressings with different ingredients and flavors. While they may both be used
  to top salads, their compositions and culinary origins are not identical. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
