text: ' No. Organic Clover Honey and Raspberry Honey are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They differ
  in their source (the type of flower the bees visited to collect nectar) which can
  affect their taste, color, and nutritional profile. Therefore, it is important to
  distinguish between them.'
