  Idli rice, also known as idli rava or cream of rice, is made from parboiled rice
  that has been coarsely ground. It is a key ingredient in making soft and fluffy
  Idlis, which are popular savory steamed cakes in South Indian cuisine.


  On the other hand, Rice paper wrappers, also called spring roll wrappers or summer
  roll skins, are thin, edible sheets typically made from watered-down rice flour
  paste, tapioca starch, and sometimes wheat or cornstarch. They are often used to
  make Vietnamese and Thai rolls like fresh spring rolls, summer rolls, or egg rolls.


  While both items contain some form of processed rice, they serve different culinary
  purposes and have distinct textures, cooking methods, and uses. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates
  since they represent unique food concepts with their own set of properties and applications.'
