text: No, Chili oil and Safflower oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Chili oil is made from chili peppers
  and typically used as a condiment or seasoning, while Safflower oil is derived from
  the seeds of the safflower plant and is often used in cooking and salad dressings.
