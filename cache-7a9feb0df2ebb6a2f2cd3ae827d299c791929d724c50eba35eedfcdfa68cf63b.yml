  Tahini dressing is made from sesame seeds, while Thousand Island dressing typically
  contains ingredients such as mayonnaise, ketchup, and pickle relish. Although they
  are both types of salad dressings, Tahini dressing and Thousand Island dressing
  have different culinary origins, uses, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
