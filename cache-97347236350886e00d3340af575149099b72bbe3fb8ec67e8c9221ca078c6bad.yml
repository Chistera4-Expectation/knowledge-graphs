text: ' No. Dry Marsala wine and rice wine are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of alcoholic drinks. They have distinct ingredients, production
  methods, flavors, uses, origins, and cultural significance that make them unique
  from one another. Therefore, they should remain separate instances within the Alcoholic
  Drink class.'
