text: No, they should not be merged together. While both cumin powder and curry powder
  are spices, they are distinct in their composition and flavor profiles. Cumin powder
  is made from ground cumin seeds and has a strong, earthy flavor, while curry powder
  is a blend of various spices, including cumin, and has a more complex, slightly
  sweet and warm flavor. They serve different purposes in cooking and are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
