text: ' No. Creamed honey and organic clover honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They refer to different types of honey products with distinct characteristics.
  Organic clover honey is a type of honey produced by bees that gather nectar from
  clover flowers, while creamed honey has undergone a process to create a spreadable
  consistency through careful cooling and stirring. Merging these two terms would
  result in loss of specificity and accuracy.'
