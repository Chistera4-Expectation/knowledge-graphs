text: ' No. While "Cinnamon" (the spice) can refer to ground cinnamon, it can also
  refer to the bark of the Cinnamomum tree that is used as a whole stick, which has
  slightly different culinary uses and nutritional properties compared to ground cinnamon.
  Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates and should be kept separate
  in a classification system for accuracy.'
