text: No, Pistachio Oil and Sunflower Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates because they are different types of edible oils with
  distinct properties, nutritional profiles, and uses. While both are derived from
  plants, they come from different sources (pistachios and sunflower seeds) and have
  unique characteristics that set them apart from each other.
