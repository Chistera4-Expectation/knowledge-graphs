text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of food derived from
  quail and have distinct preparation methods. Quail Drumsticks refer to the leg part
  of a quail, typically cooked whole, whereas Quail Patties are ground quail meat
  formed into patties, similar to chicken patties or meatballs. These differences
  in preparation and presentation warrant them being separate instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
