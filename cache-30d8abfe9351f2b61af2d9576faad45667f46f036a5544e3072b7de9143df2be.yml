text: As a dietician, my focus is primarily on nutritional aspects. However, in terms
  of semantics and ontology, 'Chili sauce' and 'Enchilada sauce' can be considered
  distinct entities due to differences in their ingredients, flavors, and uses in
  recipes. Therefore, I would suggest keeping them separate in the Sauce class.
