  While both fried chicken and turkey are types of poultry-derived food, they have
  distinct characteristics that make them non-duplicative. Fried chicken is a specific
  preparation method for chicken, while turkey refers to a type of bird that can be
  prepared in various ways (including methods similar to those used for chicken).
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
