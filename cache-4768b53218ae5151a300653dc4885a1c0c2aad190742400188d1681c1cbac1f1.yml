  Although both chicken nuggets and chicken parmesan are poultry-derived foods, they
  have different ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. Therefore,
  they should not be considered semantic and ontological duplicates. Chicken nuggets
  typically consist of ground chicken meat formed into small pieces and breaded or
  battered before being deep-fried. In contrast, chicken parmesan is made from breaded
  chicken cutlets topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and often served over pasta. These
  differences warrant separate categorization for better understanding their unique
  characteristics and making informed food choices based on personal preferences and
  dietary needs.'
