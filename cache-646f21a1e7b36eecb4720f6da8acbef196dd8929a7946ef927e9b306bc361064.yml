text: ' No. Safflower oil and palm oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While they may share some general properties
  as types of edible vegetable oils, safflower oil is derived from the seeds of the
  safflower plant (Carthamus tinctorius), while palm oil comes from the fruit of the
  oil palms (Elaeis guineensis). They have different nutritional profiles, uses, and
  production processes; therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entities
  with distinct attributes.'
