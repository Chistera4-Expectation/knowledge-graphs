text: No, 'Diced tomatoes' and 'Tomato paste' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from tomatoes, they serve
  different purposes in recipes and have distinct nutritional profiles. Diced tomatoes
  provide more texture and a chunkier consistency, while tomato paste has a concentrated
  flavor and thicker consistency. Merging them would not accurately represent their
  unique properties.
