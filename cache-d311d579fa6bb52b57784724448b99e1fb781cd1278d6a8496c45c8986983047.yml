  While both Chanterelle and Crimini mushrooms belong to the same genus (Cantharellus)
  and share some similarities in appearance and flavor, they are distinct species
  with different characteristics and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
