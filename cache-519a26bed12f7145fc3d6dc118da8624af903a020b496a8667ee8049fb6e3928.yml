text: ' No. Honey Mustard Dressing and Olive Oil Dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of dressings, they have distinct ingredients and
  characteristics. Honey Mustard Dressing typically contains honey, mustard, vinegar,
  oil, and spices, while Olive Oil Dressing is primarily made of olive oil, often
  with added herbs, garlic, lemon juice, or other seasonings.'
