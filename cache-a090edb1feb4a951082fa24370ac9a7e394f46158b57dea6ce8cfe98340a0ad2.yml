text: ' The most adequate class for Guajillo chiles would be "Food Seasoning". This
  is because guajillo chiles are typically used as a seasoning or spice to add flavor
  and heat to various dishes, rather than being the main ingredient in a dish. Other
  classes that could potentially fit guajillo chiles include "Spice" and "Food Dressing,"
  but "Food Seasoning" is likely the broadest and most appropriate category.'
