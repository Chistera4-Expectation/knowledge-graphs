text: No, Ciabatta Bread and Soda Bread should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the general category of bread,
  they are distinct types of bread with different ingredients, textures, and preparation
  methods. Keeping them as separate instances allows for more accurate categorization
  and information.
