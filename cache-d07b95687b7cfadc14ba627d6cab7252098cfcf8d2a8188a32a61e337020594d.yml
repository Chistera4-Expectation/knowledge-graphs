  The two instances, "Butter, melted" and "Unsalted butter," are not identical in
  their composition, preparation method, or nutritional content. Melted butter has
  a different consistency and may have a slightly different flavor profile compared
  to unsalted butter. Additionally, unsalted butter is made from cream that has not
  been treated with salt, whereas regular butter can contain added salt. Therefore,
  they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates.'
