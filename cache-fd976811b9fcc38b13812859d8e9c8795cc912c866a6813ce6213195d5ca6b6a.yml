text: ' No. Creamed honey and orange blossom honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, as they refer to different types of honey products with distinct characteristics.
  Creamed honey is a type of honey that has been processed to create a spreadable
  consistency, while orange blossom honey is a variety of honey made from the nectar
  of orange blossoms and has a unique flavor profile. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
