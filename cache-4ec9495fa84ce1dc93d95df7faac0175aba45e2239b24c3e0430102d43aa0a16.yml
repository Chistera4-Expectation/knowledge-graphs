text: ' No. Honey Lime Dressing and Italian Dressing are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While they may both be types of dressings, they have distinct ingredients
  and flavors. Honey Lime Dressing typically contains honey, lime juice, vinegar,
  oil, and spices, while Italian Dressing usually includes ingredients such as olive
  oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, herbs, and sometimes sugar or sweeteners. Therefore,
  they remain unique entities in the culinary domain.'
