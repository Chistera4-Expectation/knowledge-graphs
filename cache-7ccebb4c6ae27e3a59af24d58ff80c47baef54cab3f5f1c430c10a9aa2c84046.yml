text: No, Apple juice and Kiwi juice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of "juice," they
  are distinct types of juice with different flavors, nutritional profiles, and ingredients.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
