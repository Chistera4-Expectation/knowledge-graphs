text: No, Castor Oil and Hemp Seed Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are vegetable oils, they have different chemical
  compositions, properties, and uses. Castor oil is derived from the seeds of the
  castor oil plant (Ricinus communis), and its primary fatty acid is ricinoleic acid.
  Hemp seed oil, on the other hand, is derived from the seeds of the hemp plant (Cannabis
  sativa), and its primary fatty acids are linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids. Their
  applications and properties vary significantly, making them distinct entities in
  the context of edible vegetable oils.
