text: No, the instances 'Ostrich Sausage' and 'Ostrich Stock' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from
  ostrich, they are different types of food products with distinct uses and preparations.
  Ostrich sausage is a processed meat product, while ostrich stock is a liquid made
  by simmering ostrich bones, meat, or vegetables to extract flavor.
