  While both Acacia honey and Heather honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics that make them unique from each other. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Acacia honey is made primarily from the nectar of the black locust tree (Robinia
  pseudoacacia) and has a mild flavor with a light color. It also tends to have a
  higher fructose-to-glucose ratio than many other honeys, making it slower to crystallize.


  On the other hand, Heather honey comes mainly from the nectar of various heathland
  plants such as Calluna vulgaris (Ling heather), Erica cinerea (Bell heather), and
  Erica tetralix (Cross-leaved heath). It has a strong aromatic scent, often described
  as medicinal, and its taste can range from slightly bitter to sweet with fruity
  notes. The texture of Heather honey is thicker due to its high mineral content,
  which includes iron, calcium, magnesium, manganese, zinc, and potassium.


  Given these differences, it is essential to maintain separate categories for Acacia
  honey and Heather honey to ensure accurate classification and understanding of their
  unique properties.'
