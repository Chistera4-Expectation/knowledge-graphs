text: No, the instances 'Blue Crab' and 'Spider Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible crustaceans,
  they belong to different species and have distinct characteristics, flavors, and
  uses in cuisine. Merging them would result in loss of information and specificity.
