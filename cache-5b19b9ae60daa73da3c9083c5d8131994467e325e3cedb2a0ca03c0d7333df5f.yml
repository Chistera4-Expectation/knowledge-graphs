text: ' "BeverageQuantities"


  In this case, since both coffee and tea can be consumed in varying quantities, it
  would be more appropriate to categorize them based on the quantity aspect rather
  than focusing specifically on one or the other. Thus, I propose the class name "BeverageQuantities."
  This name encompasses the concept of measuring and comparing the serving sizes and
  consumption amounts of different beverages, including but not limited to coffee
  and tea.'
