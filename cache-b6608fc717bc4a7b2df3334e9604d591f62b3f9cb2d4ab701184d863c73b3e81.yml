text: ' No. Although both chili peppers and red chili powder are related to each other
  (with ground red chili peppers being used to make red chili powder), they have different
  culinary uses and nutritional profiles due to differences in processing methods.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates from a dietary perspective.'
