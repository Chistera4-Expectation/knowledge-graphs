  While canola oil and corn oil are both types of vegetable oils that share some similarities,
  they have different nutritional profiles and come from distinct sources. Canola
  oil is derived from rapeseed plants, while corn oil comes from corn kernels. They
  also differ in terms of their fatty acid composition, with canola oil containing
  more monounsaturated fats and less saturated fats than corn oil. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
