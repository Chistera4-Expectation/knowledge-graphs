  While French dressing and Lemon Herb dressing may share some similarities, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantically, these two dressings have
  different ingredients and flavors - French dressing is typically oil-based with
  vinegar, while Lemon Herb dressing has lemon juice and herbs. Ontologically, they
  belong to different categories of food dressings due to their distinct tastes and
  nutritional profiles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
