text: No, 'Turkey Broth' and 'Turkey Gizzards' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from turkey, they are different
  food items with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Turkey broth is
  a liquid made by simmering turkey bones, meat, and/or vegetables, while gizzards
  are the muscular, chewy organs found in poultry.
