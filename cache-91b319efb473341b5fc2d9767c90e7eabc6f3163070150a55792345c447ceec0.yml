text: No, Cornmeal and Cornstarch should not be merged together as they are different
  products derived from corn. Cornmeal is made from dried and ground whole corn kernels,
  while cornstarch is made from the starchy endosperm of the corn kernel. Although
  they both come from corn, they have different uses and nutritional profiles.
