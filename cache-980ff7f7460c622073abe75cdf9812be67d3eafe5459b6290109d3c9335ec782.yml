text: No, Chia Seeds and Kiwi Seeds should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both seeds, they have different nutritional
  profiles and properties. Chia Seeds are typically consumed for their high omega-3
  fatty acids, fiber, and protein content, while Kiwi Seeds are often consumed along
  with the fruit for their vitamin C and antioxidant content.
