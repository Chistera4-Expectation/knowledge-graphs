text: 'No, the instances ''Horseshoe Crab'' and ''Stone Crab'' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates in the Edible Crustaceans class.
  While both are crustaceans, they belong to different taxonomic groups and are not
  considered edible in the same way.


  Horseshoe crabs (order Xiphosura) are not true crabs and are not commonly consumed
  as food. They have a unique body structure and are primarily used for their blue
  blood, which contains Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL), a substance used to detect
  bacterial contamination in medical applications.


  Stone crabs (genus Menippe), on the other hand, are true crabs and are commonly
  consumed as food. Only their claws are harvested, and the crabs are returned to
  the water where they can regenerate their claws.


  These two instances have distinct characteristics and uses, so they should not be
  merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
