  While both avocado oil and soybean oil are types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct properties and uses that make them unique from each other. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Avocado oil is high in monounsaturated fats and has a mild flavor, making it suitable
  for salad dressings and drizzling over foods. Soybean oil, on the other hand, contains
  more polyunsaturated fats and has a neutral taste, which makes it ideal for cooking
  at high temperatures and use in processed foods. Merging these two instances would
  result in loss of valuable information about their individual characteristics and
  applications.'
