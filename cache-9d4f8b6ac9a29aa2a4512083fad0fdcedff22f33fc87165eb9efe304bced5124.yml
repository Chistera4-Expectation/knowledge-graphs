  Breadcrumbs and rye bread are not semantic or ontological duplicates and should
  not be merged together as they represent different types of food products with distinct
  properties and uses.


  Breadcrumbs refer to small pieces of crumbled bread used as a garnish, thickener,
  or binding agent in various dishes. Rye bread, on the other hand, is a type of bread
  made primarily from rye flour that has a distinctive flavor, texture, and nutritional
  profile compared to other types of bread. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two concepts into one instance.'
