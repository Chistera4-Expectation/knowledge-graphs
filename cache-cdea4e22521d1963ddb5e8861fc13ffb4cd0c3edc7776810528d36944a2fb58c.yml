text: ' No. Apple seeds and vegetable shortening are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They belong to different categories of food items - apple seeds being edible seeds
  while vegetable shortening is a type of fat commonly used in baking. While both
  may contain trace amounts of substances that can be harmful if consumed in large
  quantities (such as cyanide in apple seeds), they have distinct nutritional profiles
  and uses in cooking and eating.'
