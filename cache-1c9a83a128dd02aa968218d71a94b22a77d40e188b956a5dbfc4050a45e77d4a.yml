text: As a dietician, my answer is that they should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both mustard seeds and yellow mustard are related
  to mustard, they are different in their form and usage. Mustard seeds are the raw
  form, while yellow mustard is a prepared condiment made from mustard seeds, vinegar,
  and other ingredients. They serve different purposes in cooking and have distinct
  nutritional profiles.
