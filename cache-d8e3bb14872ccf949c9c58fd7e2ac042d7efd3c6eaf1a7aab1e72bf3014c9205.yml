text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both drinks are infusions,
  they have different ingredients (Apple Clove Infusion has apples and cloves, while
  Cucumber Mint Infusion has cucumbers and mint) and would likely have distinct flavors
  and nutritional profiles. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences
  between the two drinks.
