  Idli rice, also known as idli rava or cream of rice, is made from parboiled rice
  that has been fermented and then coarsely ground. It is commonly used to make the
  Indian steamed cake called idli. Jasmine rice, on the other hand, is a type of long-grain
  fragrant rice that is native to Thailand. While both Idli rice and Jasmine rice
  are types of rice, they have different properties, uses, and nutritional profiles,
  so they should not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
