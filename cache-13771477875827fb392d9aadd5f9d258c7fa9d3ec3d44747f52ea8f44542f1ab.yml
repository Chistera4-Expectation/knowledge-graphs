text: ' No. While "chicken" is a type of poultry that can refer to the whole animal
  or its meat in various forms, "grilled chicken" specifically refers to chicken meat
  that has been cooked using a grilling method. Therefore, they are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates but rather different instances within the same broader category.'
