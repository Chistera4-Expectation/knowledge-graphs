  Although tomato puree and tomato are semantically and ontologically similar, they
  are distinct entities with different nutritional profiles. Tomato puree is a processed
  food made from tomatoes that has been blended with other ingredients, such as water,
  salt, and pepper. Tomato, on the other hand, is a fruit that is eaten whole or used
  in many dishes.'
