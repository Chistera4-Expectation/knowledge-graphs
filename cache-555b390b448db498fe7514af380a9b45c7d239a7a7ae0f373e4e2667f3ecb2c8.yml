text: ' No. Feta cheese and shredded mozzarella cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they are both types of cheese. They have different nutritional
  profiles, textures, flavors, uses in cooking, and origins. Therefore, it is important
  to distinguish between them when providing nutrition information or making recommendations
  for their use in a healthy diet.'
