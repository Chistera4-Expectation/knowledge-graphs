  The amount of protein in the juice per serving and the quantity of juice in the
  container are two distinct pieces of information that serve different purposes for
  a dietitian. The former is related to the nutritional content of the juice, while
  the latter pertains to the volume or size of the container. Therefore, they should
  not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
