  While both ginger paste and pepper to taste can be used for seasoning food, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Ginger paste is a specific form of ginger
  that has been ground into a paste, typically made from fresh ginger root, water,
  and sometimes other ingredients like vinegar or oil. It has a unique flavor profile
  and texture, and is often used in dishes such as curries, soups, and stir-fries.


  On the other hand, "pepper to taste" refers to adding black pepper (or occasionally
  white or green pepper) to a dish according to personal preference. Black pepper
  has its own distinct flavor and aroma, which complements many different types of
  foods.


  Therefore, while both ginger paste and pepper to taste serve similar functions in
  cooking (i.e., enhancing the flavor of food), they are not interchangeable terms,
  nor do they refer to identical concepts. As such, they should not be merged as semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
