text: No, Pheasant Eggs and Pheasant Gravy should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both derived from poultry, specifically pheasants, they
  are distinct food items with different nutritional profiles and culinary applications.
  Pheasant Eggs are a source of protein and other nutrients, whereas Pheasant Gravy
  is a sauce made from the drippings of cooked pheasant, typically used to flavor
  other dishes.
