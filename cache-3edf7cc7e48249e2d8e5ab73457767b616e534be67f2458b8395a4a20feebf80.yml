text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Pork Belly
  and Pork Tenderloin are different cuts of pork with distinct characteristics, flavors,
  and nutritional profiles. While both are derived from pigs, they are not interchangeable
  in terms of their culinary uses and nutritional content.
