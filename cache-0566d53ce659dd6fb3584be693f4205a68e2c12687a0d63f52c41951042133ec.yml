text: ' No. While both nuts and groundnuts are seeds that can be consumed and have
  similar nutritional profiles, they belong to different botanical families. Nuts
  are dry fruits with one seed, such as almonds, walnuts, and hazelnuts, while groundnuts
  (also known as peanuts) are legumes that grow underground. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to keep them distinct in terms of their classification.'
