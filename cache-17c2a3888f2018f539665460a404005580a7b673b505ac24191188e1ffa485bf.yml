text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Guinea Fowl Gravy' and 'Guinea
  Fowl Thighs' are derived from guinea fowl, they are different types of poultry-derived
  food items with distinct nutritional and preparation characteristics. 'Guinea Fowl
  Gravy' is a sauce made from the juices and meat of the guinea fowl, while 'Guinea
  Fowl Thighs' refer to the thigh meat of the bird. They are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
