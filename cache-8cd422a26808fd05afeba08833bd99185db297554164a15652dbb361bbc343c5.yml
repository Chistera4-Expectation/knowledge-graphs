  While both sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite are used as food preservatives, they
  have different chemical structures and functions, and are not interchangeable in
  all contexts. Sodium nitrate is primarily used to preserve meats, while sodium nitrite
  is used to prevent bacterial growth and to give cured meats their characteristic
  pink color and distinctive flavor. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
