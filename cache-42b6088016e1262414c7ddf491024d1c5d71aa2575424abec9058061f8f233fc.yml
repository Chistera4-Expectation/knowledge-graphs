text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both Melon Seeds and Seeds are related, they are not the same thing. Melon Seeds
  are a specific type of seeds, while Seeds can encompass a wide variety of seeds
  from different plants. In a classification system, they would be separate instances
  within the broader category of seeds.
