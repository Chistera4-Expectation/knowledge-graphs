text: No, Mineral Water and Spring Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they share some similarities, such as being sourced
  from natural springs, they differ in their composition and properties. Mineral Water
  contains a significant amount of minerals, whereas Spring Water typically has lower
  mineral content. Therefore, they should be considered as distinct types of drinking
  water.
