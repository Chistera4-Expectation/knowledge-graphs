text: No, "Duck Nuggets" and "Duck Wings" should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates because they are distinct food items made from different parts of the
  duck. Although they both belong to the Poultry-derived Food class, their preparation,
  appearance, and possibly nutritional content differ.
