text: No, they should not be merged. Lactose-free milk and nut milk are different
  types of milk with distinct characteristics and sources. Lactose-free milk is derived
  from cows but has had the lactose removed or altered to be more easily digestible
  for those with lactose intolerance, while nut milk (e.g., almond milk, cashew milk)
  is made from nuts and does not contain any dairy. They serve different dietary needs
  and preferences, and therefore should be treated as separate entities.
