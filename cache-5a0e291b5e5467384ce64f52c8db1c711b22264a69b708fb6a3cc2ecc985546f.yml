  While both chopped onions and fried onions are types of prepared onions, they have
  different preparation methods (chopping vs. frying) and thus cannot be considered
  exact semantic duplicates. Boiled eggs and nuts also do not overlap with chopped
  onions in terms of their properties and uses, so they should remain separate from
  chopped onions. However, it is possible that some users may consider fried onions
  to be optional ingredients for certain recipes just as boiled eggs and nuts might
  be, depending on individual preferences.'
