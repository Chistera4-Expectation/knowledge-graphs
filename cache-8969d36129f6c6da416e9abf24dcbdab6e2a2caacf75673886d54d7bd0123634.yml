text: ' "Infusion Drink (with Iron-fortified ingredients)" would be the most appropriate
  class for an iron infusion, as neither coffee nor tea naturally contain sufficient
  amounts of iron to be considered an iron infusion. An infusion drink specifically
  refers to a liquid prepared by steeping herbs or other plant materials in hot water,
  which can sometimes be fortified with nutrients like iron.'
