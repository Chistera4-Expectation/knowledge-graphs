  Cantaloupe seeds and sunflower seeds are distinct types of edible seeds that belong
  to different plant species. Cantaloupe seeds come from the cantaloupe melon (Cucumis
  melo var. reticulatus), while sunflower seeds come from the sunflower plant (Helianthus
  annuus). Although both can be eaten and have nutritional benefits, they differ significantly
  in terms of their taste, texture, appearance, and nutrient content. Therefore, it
  is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
