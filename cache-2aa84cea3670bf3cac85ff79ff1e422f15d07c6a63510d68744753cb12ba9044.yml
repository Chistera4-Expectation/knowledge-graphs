text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  cricket flour and locust flour are derived from insects and can be used as ingredients
  in food products, they are distinct species and may have different nutritional profiles
  and flavors. Maintaining separate instances allows for more specific information
  and classification.
