text: As a dietician, I would recommend consulting a nutrition expert or a food scientist
  to make a definitive decision on merging the instances 'Macadamia Milk' and 'Nut
  Milk.' However, from a general perspective, they are not semantic and ontologic
  duplicates as 'Macadamia Milk' specifically refers to a milk alternative made from
  macadamia nuts, while 'Nut Milk' is a broader term that could encompass various
  types of nut-based milk, including macadamia milk.
