text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  they are both derived from chicken, they have different properties and uses. Chicken
  gravy is a thickened sauce typically made from the drippings of cooked chicken,
  while chicken stock is a liquid made by simmering chicken bones, vegetables, and
  seasonings. They serve different purposes in cooking and should be considered distinct
  food items.
