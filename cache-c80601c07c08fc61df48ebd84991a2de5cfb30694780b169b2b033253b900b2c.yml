text: No, 'Apple juice' and 'Strawberry juice' should not be merged together as they
  are distinct types of juice made from different fruits, with different flavors,
  nutritional profiles, and possibly even different preparation methods. While they
  both belong to the broader category of juice, they are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
