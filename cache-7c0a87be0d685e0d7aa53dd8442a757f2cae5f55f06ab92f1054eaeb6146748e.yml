  While soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce may have some similar uses in cooking as
  flavor enhancers, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different
  ingredients, flavors, appearances, and origins. Soy sauce is made from fermented
  soybeans and wheat, while Worcestershire sauce contains vinegar, molasses, anchovies,
  tamarind, and other spices. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two concepts as duplicates.'
