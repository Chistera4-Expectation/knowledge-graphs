  While both grain-finished beef and lean beef are types of beef, they refer to different
  characteristics of the meat. Grain-finished beef refers to cattle that have been
  fed grains during the finishing phase of production, resulting in marbling and flavor.
  Lean beef, on the other hand, refers to cuts of beef with less fat content. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as they describe distinct
  aspects of the beef product.'
