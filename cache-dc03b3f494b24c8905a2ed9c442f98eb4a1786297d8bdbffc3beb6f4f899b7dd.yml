  While both ground beef and beef back ribs are types of beef, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they have different properties and uses. Ground
  beef is made from chopped or minced meat, often used for cooking burgers, meatballs,
  and sauces, while beef back ribs refer to the rib bones with attached meat, typically
  cooked by grilling, smoking, or braising. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as duplicates.'
