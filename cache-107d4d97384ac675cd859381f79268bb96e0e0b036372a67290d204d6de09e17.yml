text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of juice, they
  have different ingredients and nutritional profiles. Blueberry juice is made from
  blueberries, which are a fruit, while vegetable juice is made from vegetables. Merging
  them together would not accurately represent the differences in their nutritional
  content and properties.
