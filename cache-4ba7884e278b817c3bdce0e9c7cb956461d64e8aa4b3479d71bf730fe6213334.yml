text: No, Hazelnut Oil and Macadamia Nut Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both edible vegetal oils derived from nuts,
  they have distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses in cooking and food preparation.
  Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the class.
