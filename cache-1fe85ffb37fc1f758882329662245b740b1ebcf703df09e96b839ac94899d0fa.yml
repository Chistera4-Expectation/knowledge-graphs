  Pumpkin seed oil and rice bran oil are not semantic or ontological duplicates, despite
  both being types of edible vegetable oils. They come from different plant sources
  (pumpkin seeds vs. rice grains), have unique nutritional profiles, taste, color,
  and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to keep them separate when discussing
  or categorizing edible vegetable oils.'
