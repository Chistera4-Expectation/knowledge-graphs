text: No, Lactose-free Butter and Plant-based Butter should not be merged as they
  have different compositions and sources. Lactose-free Butter is still derived from
  dairy, but with lactose removed, while Plant-based Butter is derived entirely from
  plant sources. They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
