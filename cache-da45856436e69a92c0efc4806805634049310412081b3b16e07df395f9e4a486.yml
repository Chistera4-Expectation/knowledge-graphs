text: 'No, the instances ''Optional: Wood ear mushrooms'' and ''Portobello Mushroom''
  should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. These two types
  of mushrooms have distinct characteristics and properties. Wood ear mushrooms, for
  example, have a unique texture and are often used in Asian cuisine, while Portobello
  mushrooms are larger and commonly used as a meat substitute in vegetarian dishes.
  Merging these instances would result in a loss of information and specificity.'
