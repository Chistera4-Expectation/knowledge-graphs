text: No, Coconut Oil and Rice Bran Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Merging them would result in
  the loss of important information about each type of oil.
