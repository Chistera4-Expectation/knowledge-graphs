text: ' No. Jasmine rice is a type of rice with distinct characteristics, such as
  its fragrance and texture, that make it different from other types of rice. Therefore,
  they should not be treated as semantic and ontological duplicates. It''s important
  to maintain separate entries for each type of rice to accurately capture their unique
  properties and provide accurate nutrition information.'
