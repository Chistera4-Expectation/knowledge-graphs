text: No, Quail Gizzards and Quail Gravy should not be merged together as they are
  distinct poultry-derived food items. Quail Gizzards refer to the muscular digestive
  organ found in quails, while Quail Gravy is a sauce made from the drippings or broth
  of cooked quail meat. They are different in both form and function within the context
  of poultry-derived food.
