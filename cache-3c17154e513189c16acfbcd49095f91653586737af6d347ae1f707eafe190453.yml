text: No, the instances 'King Oyster Mushroom' and 'Mushrooms' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are different types of mushrooms
  with distinct characteristics and properties. While both belong to the broader category
  of edible mushrooms, they are not the same. King Oyster Mushroom is a specific variety,
  whereas 'Mushrooms' is a general term encompassing a wide range of fungi species
  that can be eaten.
