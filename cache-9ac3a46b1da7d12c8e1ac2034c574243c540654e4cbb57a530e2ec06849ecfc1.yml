text: ' No. While "chicken breast" (singular) and "chicken breasts" (plural) refer
  to the same cut of meat from a chicken, they are not considered duplicate entries
  in a poultry-derived food class. This is because they serve different purposes depending
  on the context: one refers to an individual piece of meat, while the other implies
  multiple pieces. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between them for clarity
  and accuracy in nutritional information and recipe development.'
