text: ' No. Flaxseeds (also known as linseeds) and quinoa seeds are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates. While both flaxseeds and quinoa seeds can be considered
  edible seeds, they belong to different plant families with distinct nutritional
  profiles and uses:


  1. Flaxseeds (Linum usitatissimum) - These seeds originate from the flax plant,
  which is part of the Linaceae family. They contain high levels of omega-3 fatty
  acids, lignans, protein, and fiber. Flaxseeds have various health benefits such
  as improving digestion, reducing cholesterol levels, and lowering the risk of heart
  disease and cancer. Typically, people consume them ground or crushed because whole
  flaxseeds may pass through the body undigested.

  2. Quinoa seeds (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) - Derived from the goosefoot plant,
  which belongs to the Amaranthaceae family, quinoa seeds differ significantly from
  flaxseeds. Although commonly referred to as "seeds," quinoa grains are technically
  classified as pseudo-cereals due to their carbohydrate content and preparation methods
  similar to cereal grains like rice and oats. Quinoa provides an excellent source
  of complete proteins, containing all nine essential amino acids along with minerals,
  vitamins, and antioxidants. It has been shown to improve blood sugar control, reduce
  inflammation, and aid weight loss.


  Given these differences, it would be incorrect to merge flaxseeds and quinoa seeds
  as semantic or ontological duplicates since each holds unique properties and applications
  within nutrition and health contexts.'
