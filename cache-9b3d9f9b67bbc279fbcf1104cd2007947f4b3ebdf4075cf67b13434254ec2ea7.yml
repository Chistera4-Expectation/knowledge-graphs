  While both refer to the same seasoning, "Pepper" is typically used to specify a
  certain amount of pepper added to a recipe (e.g., "1 teaspoon of Pepper"), while
  "pepper to taste" allows the cook to add an amount based on their personal preference.
  Therefore, they serve different functions within a recipe and should not be merged
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
