  While both "breadcrumbs" and "panko breadcrumbs" are indeed made from bread, they
  have different textures and uses in cooking, which makes them distinct entities.
  Breadcrumbs are typically made from dried bread that has been ground into small
  crumbs, while panko breadcrumbs are made from crustless white bread that has been
  crumbled into fine flakes. Panko breadcrumbs have a lighter, airier texture than
  traditional breadcrumbs, which makes them ideal for certain applications such as
  breading fish or chicken. In contrast, breadcrumbs may be better suited for binding
  ingredients together in meatballs or meatloaf. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
