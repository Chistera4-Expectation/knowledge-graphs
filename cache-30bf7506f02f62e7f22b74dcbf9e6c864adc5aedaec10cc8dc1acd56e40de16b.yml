text: No, they should not be merged together. Dark soy sauce and Tartar sauce are
  two distinct types of sauces with different ingredients, flavors, and uses. Dark
  soy sauce is a type of soy sauce, while Tartar sauce is a creamy condiment typically
  made with mayonnaise, capers, and pickles. Merging them as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates would not accurately represent their differences.
