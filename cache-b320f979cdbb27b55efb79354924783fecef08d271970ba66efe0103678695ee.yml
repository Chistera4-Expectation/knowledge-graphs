text: No, Argan Oil and Castor Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have different properties,
  uses, and origins. Argan Oil is primarily produced in Morocco from the kernels of
  the argan tree, while Castor Oil is produced from the seeds of the castor oil plant,
  which is native to the Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India. Additionally,
  they have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking and cosmetics.
