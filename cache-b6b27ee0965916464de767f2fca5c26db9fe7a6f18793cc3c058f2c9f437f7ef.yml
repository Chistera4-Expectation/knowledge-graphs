  While both Maitake and Porcini mushrooms are edible and share some similarities
  in terms of their nutritional profiles, they belong to different species and have
  distinct differences in their flavors, textures, and culinary uses. Therefore, it
  is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
