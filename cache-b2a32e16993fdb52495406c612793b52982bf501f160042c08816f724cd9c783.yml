text: ' "Edible Ingredients" would be the most adequate class to group all the items
  you mentioned, as they are all types of food or drink that can be consumed. However,
  if you want to further categorize them, "Protein Source," "Dairy Product," "Grain,"
  "Beverage," and "Seasoning" could also work, depending on which items you want to
  include in each category. For example, under "Optional Ingredient," you might consider
  including things like "Alcoholic Drinks," "Honey," "Sweeteners," and "Food Seasonings."'
