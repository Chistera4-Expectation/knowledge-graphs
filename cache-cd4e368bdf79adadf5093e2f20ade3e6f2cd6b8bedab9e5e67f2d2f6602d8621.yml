text: ' "Dairy Alternative" would be the most appropriate class for soy milk, as it
  is an alternative to traditional dairy products such as butter, cheese, milk, and
  yogurt. This class name highlights that while soy milk may share some similarities
  with these other items in terms of usage or nutritional content, it comes from a
  different source (soybeans) than animal-based milks.'
