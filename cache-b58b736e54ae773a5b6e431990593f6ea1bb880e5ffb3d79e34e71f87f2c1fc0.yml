text: ' No. While "Lasagna noodles" are one type of pasta commonly used to make lasagna,
  they refer to different things. Lasagna noodles are a specific type of pasta, while
  lasagna is a dish made with those noodles (along with other ingredients like sauce
  and cheese). Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.'
