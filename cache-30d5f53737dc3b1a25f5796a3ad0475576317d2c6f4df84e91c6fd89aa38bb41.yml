text: ' No. Corn husks and corn masa are not semantic or ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged together. They refer to different parts of the corn plant and
  have distinct uses in cooking. Corn husks are the outer leaves of the corn ear and
  are often used for wrapping tamales, while corn masa is made from dried corn kernels
  that have been soaked in an alkaline solution (nixtamalization), hulled, and ground
  into a dough-like consistency, which is commonly used to make tortillas, tamales,
  and other Latin American dishes.'
