text: No, Flavored Water and Oxygenated Water should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have different
  properties and purposes. Flavored Water is typically regular water infused with
  natural or artificial flavors, while Oxygenated Water contains dissolved oxygen
  for potential health benefits or performance enhancement. Merging them would not
  accurately represent the distinct characteristics of each type of water.
