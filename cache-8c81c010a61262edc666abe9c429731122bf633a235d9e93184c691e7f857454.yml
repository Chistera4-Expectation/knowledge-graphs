  While both "Blue Cheese Dressing" and "French Dressing" are types of salad dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients and flavors that make them unique from one another.
  Blue cheese dressing is made with blue cheese, mayonnaise, and buttermilk, while
  French dressing typically contains oil, vinegar, tomato paste, and various herbs
  and spices. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  as semantic and ontological duplicates since they represent different food items.'
