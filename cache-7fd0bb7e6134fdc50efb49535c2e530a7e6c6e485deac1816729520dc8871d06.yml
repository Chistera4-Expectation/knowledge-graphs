text: No, they should not be merged. While they both belong to the same "Milk" class,
  'Milk' and 'Whole milk' are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Whole milk'
  is a specific type of milk with a higher fat content, whereas 'Milk' is a more general
  term that encompasses various types of milk, including whole milk, skimmed milk,
  and others. They should be kept as separate instances, as they have different properties
  and characteristics.
