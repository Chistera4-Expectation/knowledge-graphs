text: As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on the culinary aspects of these
  two cheeses. While Parmesan cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese share many similarities,
  they are not exactly the same. Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese is a specific type of
  Parmesan cheese that adheres to strict production standards and comes from a specific
  region in Italy. Therefore, while they are closely related, they should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates in a cheese class.
