text: No, the instances 'Fish' and 'Redfish' should not be merged as they are not
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Fish' is a general term referring to a large
  group of aquatic animals, while 'Redfish' is a specific type of fish, such as Red
  Drum or Red Snapper. They have different characteristics and properties, and thus
  should not be merged.
