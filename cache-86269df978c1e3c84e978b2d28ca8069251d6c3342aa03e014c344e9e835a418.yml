text: ' No. Black pepper and Scotch bonnet pepper are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They belong to different categories of peppers: black pepper is a type
  of mild spice derived from the dried fruit of the Piper nigrum plant, while Scotch
  bonnet pepper is a hot chili pepper that belongs to the Capsicum chinense species.
  Although they share the common term "pepper," they have distinct flavors, appearances,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, merging them would result in incorrect
  information and loss of valuable distinctions for users seeking specific advice
  on these ingredients.'
