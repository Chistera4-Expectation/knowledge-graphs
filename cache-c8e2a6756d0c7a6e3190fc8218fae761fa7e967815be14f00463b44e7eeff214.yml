text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While both "Quail Patties" and "Quail Thighs" are derived from quail, they are different
  food preparations with distinct characteristics, such as shape, texture, and cooking
  methods. Therefore, they should be considered separate instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
