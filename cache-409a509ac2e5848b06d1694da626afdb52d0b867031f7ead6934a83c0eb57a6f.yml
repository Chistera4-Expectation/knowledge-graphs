text: No, 'Fish' and 'Swordfish' should not be merged together as they are different
  types of fish. 'Fish' is a general term for a category of aquatic animals, while
  'Swordfish' is a specific species within the Edible Fish class. They can be related,
  but they are not duplicates in terms of semantics or ontology.
