text: No, Manuka Honey and Tupelo Honey should not be merged together as they have
  distinct properties and origins. Manuka Honey is produced in New Zealand and Australia
  from the nectar of the Manuka tree, while Tupelo Honey is produced in the southeastern
  United States from the nectar of the Tupelo tree. They also have different nutritional
  and medicinal properties.
