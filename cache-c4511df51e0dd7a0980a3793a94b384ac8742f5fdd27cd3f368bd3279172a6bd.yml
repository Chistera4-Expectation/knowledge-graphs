  While both "Piri Piri Sauce" and "Sauce" may share some common characteristics (e.g.,
  they are both condiments), they have distinct properties that make them different
  entities. "Piri Piri Sauce" is a specific type of sauce made with African bird''s
  eye chili peppers and other ingredients, while "Sauce" is a more general category
  for any liquid or semi-liquid food ingredient used to add flavor or moisture to
  dishes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
