text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although both Ostrich Gizzards and Pheasant Gizzards are derived from poultry and
  classified under the Poultry-derived Food class, they are still distinct types of
  food with different nutritional profiles, tastes, and textures. Thus, they should
  be treated as separate instances in a dietary classification system.
