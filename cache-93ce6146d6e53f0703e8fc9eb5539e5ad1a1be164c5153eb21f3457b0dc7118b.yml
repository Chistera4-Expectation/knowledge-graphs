text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are alternative types
  of milk, 'Goat's Milk' and 'Nut Milk' belong to different subcategories within the
  Milk class. Goat's Milk is a type of animal milk, while Nut Milk is a plant-based
  milk alternative. They have different nutritional profiles and production processes,
  so they should be treated as separate instances within the Milk class.
