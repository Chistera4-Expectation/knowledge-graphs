text: As a dietician, my answer would be no, they should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both 'Onion slices' and 'Red onion' refer
  to onions, they are not exactly the same. 'Onion slices' refers to the action of
  cutting an onion into thin pieces, while 'Red onion' refers to a specific variety
  of onion, characterized by its red skin and purple flesh. Therefore, they should
  be treated as separate instances in the Edible Vegetable class.
