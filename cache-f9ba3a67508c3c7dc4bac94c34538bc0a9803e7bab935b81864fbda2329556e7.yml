text: No, "Ostrich Soup" and "Ostrich Stock" should not be merged together as they
  are two distinct dishes made from ostrich meat. While they both fall under the Poultry-derived
  Food class, they have different ingredients, preparation methods, and uses in cooking.
  Ostrich Soup typically contains other ingredients like vegetables and seasonings,
  while Ostrich Stock is a concentrated liquid made from simmering ostrich bones,
  vegetables, and seasonings, which is used as a base for soups, sauces, and other
  dishes.
