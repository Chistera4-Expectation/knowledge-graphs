text: ' No. Grapeseed oil and sesame oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of edible vegetable oils. They come from different plant
  sources (grape seeds vs. sesame seeds) and have distinct nutritional profiles and
  uses in cooking and other applications. Therefore, they should remain separate entries
  with their unique properties and characteristics preserved.'
