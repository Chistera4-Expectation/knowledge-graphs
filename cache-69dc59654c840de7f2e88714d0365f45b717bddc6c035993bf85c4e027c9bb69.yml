text: No, Chili oil and Flaxseed oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct types of edible vegetal oils with different
  compositions, uses, and nutritional properties. Chili oil is made from chili peppers,
  while Flaxseed oil is derived from the seeds of the flax plant. They serve different
  purposes in cooking and have different health benefits.
