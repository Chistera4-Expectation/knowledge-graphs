text: No, the instances 'Coffee' and 'Turkish Coffee' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of coffee, they represent
  different specific preparations and can have distinct characteristics, flavors,
  and cultural significance. In a class hierarchy, 'Turkish Coffee' would be a subclass
  of 'Coffee', but they are not duplicates.
