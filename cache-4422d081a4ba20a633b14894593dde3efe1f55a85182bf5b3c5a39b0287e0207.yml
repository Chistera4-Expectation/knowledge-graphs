text: ' No. A diced hard-boiled egg and diced onion are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they refer to two distinct types of food that have different
  nutritional profiles, tastes, textures, and uses in cooking. While both can be diced
  into small pieces, they belong to separate categories of ingredients: one is a type
  of prepared egg dish, while the other is a vegetable. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge these instances as duplicates.'
