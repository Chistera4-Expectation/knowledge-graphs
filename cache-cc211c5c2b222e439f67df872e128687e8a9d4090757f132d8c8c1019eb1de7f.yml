text: No, the instances 'Goat meat' and 'Guinea Fowl Meatballs' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct types of poultry-derived
  food with different properties and ingredients. 'Goat meat' refers to meat from
  a goat, while 'Guinea Fowl Meatballs' are a specific dish made with guinea fowl
  meat. They are not duplicates of each other.
