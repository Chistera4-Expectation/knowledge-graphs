text: ' Coffee is the most appropriate choice for ''Muscle Recovery Fuel'' between
  the two options provided. While tea also has some benefits, coffee contains caffeine
  which can help improve physical performance by increasing adrenaline levels in your
  blood and stimulating fatty acid release from the fat tissues into the blood. This
  process helps to enhance exercise endurance and reduce muscle pain during workouts.
  However, it is essential to consume coffee moderately as excessive intake may lead
  to side effects such as insomnia or increased heart rate. Always consult with a
  professional before making significant changes to your diet or supplement regimen.'
