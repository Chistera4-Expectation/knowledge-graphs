text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both "Chicken Tenders" and
  "Chicken Wings" are derived from poultry, they are distinct types of cuts with different
  shapes, sizes, and possibly cooking methods, which make them separate entities in
  a culinary context. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic or ontological
  duplicates.
