text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are poultry-derived stocks,
  'Chicken Stock' and 'Guinea Fowl Stock' are distinct products made from different
  types of poultry and can have different flavors and nutritional profiles. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each stock.
