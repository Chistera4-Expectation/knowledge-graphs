  While both safflower oil and scallion oil are types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have different flavors, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Safflower oil is
  a popular choice for cooking due to its high smoke point and neutral flavor, while
  scallion oil has a distinctive flavor and is often used in Asian cuisine. They are
  not interchangeable in recipes, so it''s beneficial to keep them separate. Therefore,
  I would not merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
