text: ' No. While both Eucalyptus honey and Heather honey are types of honey, they
  come from different plant sources (eucalyptus plants vs heather plants) and have
  distinct flavor profiles, nutritional content, and other properties. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
