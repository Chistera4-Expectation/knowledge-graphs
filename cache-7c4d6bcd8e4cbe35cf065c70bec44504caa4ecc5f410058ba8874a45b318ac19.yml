text: No, the instances 'Vegetables of your choice' and 'Vegetables' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they may have a similar
  meaning, 'Vegetables of your choice' is a more specific term that implies a selection
  of various vegetables, whereas 'Vegetables' is a more general term encompassing
  all types of vegetables. They have different levels of specificity and can be used
  in different contexts, so it is useful to keep them as separate instances.
