text: No, Quail Stock and Quail should not be merged together as they are different
  entities within the Poultry-derived Food class. Quail Stock refers to a liquid preparation
  made from simmering quail bones, while Quail refers to the meat of the bird itself.
  They are related but distinct concepts.
