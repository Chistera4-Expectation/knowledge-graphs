text: ' The most adequate class for "Puffed Wheat" among the given options would be
  "Breakfast Coreal". Puffed wheat is a type of breakfast cereal that undergoes a
  process called puffing, which involves heating and expanding grains to create air
  pockets. This results in a lightweight, crunchy texture that is popular as a breakfast
  food. Other categories like bread, pasta types, and rice are not an accurate fit
  for puffed wheat.'
