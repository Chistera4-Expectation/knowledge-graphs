  While blue cheese dressing and honey mustard dressing may belong to the same category
  of food (i.e., salad dressings), they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates.
  Semantically, they have different ingredients and flavors - blue cheese dressing
  is made with blue cheese, while honey mustard dressing contains honey and mustard.
  Ontologically, they represent distinct entities with unique properties and uses
  in culinary contexts. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
