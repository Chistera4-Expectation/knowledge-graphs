text: No, the instances 'Crab' and 'Porcelain Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are edible crustaceans, they
  belong to different taxonomic families and have distinct characteristics, appearances,
  and culinary uses. Maintaining separate instances allows for accurate categorization
  and distinction between the two.
