text: No, the instances 'Ostrich Nuggets' and 'Ostrich Tenders' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from
  ostrich meat, they differ in shape and possibly in preparation methods, which could
  impact their nutritional value and cooking properties.
