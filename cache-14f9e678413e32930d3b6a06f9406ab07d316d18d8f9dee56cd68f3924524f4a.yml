text: ' No. While both "chicken" and "rotisserie chicken" are types of poultry food,
  they have different characteristics and uses. Chicken is a type of domesticated
  bird that is widely raised for its meat, while rotisserie chicken refers to a specific
  cooking method where a whole chicken is cooked on a spit over an open flame or heat
  source. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
