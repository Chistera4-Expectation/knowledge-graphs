text: ' No. While both "Protein per serving" and "Sodium per serving" provide information
  about nutritional content, they measure different components and are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Merging them would result in loss of specific and valuable
  nutritional data for cheese products being analyzed or compared.'
