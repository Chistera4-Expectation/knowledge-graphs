text: No, Glacier Water and Tap Water should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct characteristics
  and sources. Glacier Water is derived from melting glaciers and is often marketed
  as a premium water source, while Tap Water is sourced from municipal water systems
  and can vary in quality depending on the location and treatment processes. These
  differences make them unique entities in the context of a Drinking Water class.
