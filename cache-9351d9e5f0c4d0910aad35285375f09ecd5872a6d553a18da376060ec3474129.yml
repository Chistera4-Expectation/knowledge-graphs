text: No, Castor Oil and Grapeseed Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Castor oil is derived from the seeds of the castor
  plant (Ricinus communis) and has a high content of ricinoleic acid, while grapeseed
  oil is extracted from the seeds of grapes and is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids,
  particularly linoleic acid.
