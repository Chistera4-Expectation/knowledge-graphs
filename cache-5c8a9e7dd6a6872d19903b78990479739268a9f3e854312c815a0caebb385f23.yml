text: ' No. Alfalfa honey and creamed honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Although they may both fall under the category of "honey," they refer to different
  types of honey with distinct characteristics. Alfalfa honey is a type of honey made
  from the nectar of alfalfa flowers, while creamed honey (also known as spun or whipped
  honey) refers to a process of blending and churning honey to create a spreadable
  consistency. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  as duplicates.'
