  Pecorino Romano is a specific type of cheese that falls under the broader category
  of cheeses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While Pecorino Romano shares certain characteristics with
  other types of cheese, it has distinct features that make it unique within the category.
  By keeping these concepts separate, we can accurately represent their relationships
  and enable more precise knowledge representation and reasoning.'
