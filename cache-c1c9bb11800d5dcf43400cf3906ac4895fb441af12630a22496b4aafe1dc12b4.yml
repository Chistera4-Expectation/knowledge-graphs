text: No, they should not be merged. While both are derived from Guinea Fowl, they
  represent different parts of the animal and therefore have different nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses. Guinea Fowl Eggs and Guinea Fowl Thighs should be treated
  as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
