text: No, Flaxseed Oil and Peanut Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  properties, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking and other applications. Merging
  them would result in a loss of important information and would not accurately represent
  the differences between these two types of oil.
