text: ' No. Avocado Dressing and Wasabi Dressing are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they may both fall under the category of "Food Dressings," they have distinct
  ingredients, flavors, and uses that make them unique from one another. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
