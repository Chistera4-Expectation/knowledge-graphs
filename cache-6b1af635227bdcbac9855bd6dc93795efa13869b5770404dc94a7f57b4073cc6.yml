text: As a dietician, I can provide insights into the nutritional content of these
  yogurt types, but the decision to merge instances in a Yogurt class would depend
  on the specific context and goals of the classification system. Generally speaking,
  'French Yogurt' and 'Lassi Yogurt' have distinct cultural origins and preparation
  methods, so they might not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates in certain
  contexts. However, if the focus is solely on the nutritional profile of yogurt,
  then they could be considered functionally similar and potentially merged in that
  context. Ultimately, the decision would depend on the specific goals and criteria
  of the classification system.
