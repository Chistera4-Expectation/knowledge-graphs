  While both Creamy Garlic Dressing and French Dressing may fall under the general
  category of "Salad Dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They have distinct ingredients, flavors, textures, and uses in recipes. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate and maintain their individual identities
  within the Food Dressing class.'
