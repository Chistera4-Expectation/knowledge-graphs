text: No, Camel Milk and Whole Milk should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of milk, they have distinct nutritional
  profiles, properties, and origins. Camel Milk, for example, has unique health benefits,
  such as being lower in lactose and higher in certain vitamins and minerals compared
  to cow's milk. Therefore, they should be considered separate entities in a milk
  classification system.
