text: As a dietician, I would not answer "yes" or "no" directly, as it depends on
  the specific context and purpose of the Sauce class. From a linguistic and gastronomic
  perspective, 'Mole sauce' and 'sour sauce' are different types of sauces with distinct
  ingredients, flavors, and uses. If the Sauce class is designed to represent a variety
  of sauces and their unique characteristics, then it would be appropriate to keep
  them as separate instances. However, if the class is focusing on a more generalized
  concept of sauces and their properties, then merging them as duplicates could be
  considered. Ultimately, it is essential to consider the purpose and goals of the
  class when making such decisions.
