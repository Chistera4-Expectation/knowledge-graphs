text: No, Lactose-free milk and Oat milk should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of milk, they have different compositions
  and sources. Lactose-free milk is derived from cow's milk but has lactose removed,
  while Oat milk is plant-based, made from oats. They cater to different dietary requirements
  and preferences.
