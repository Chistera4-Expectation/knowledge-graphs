  While flaxseed oil and pumpkin seed oil have some similarities (they are both oils
  extracted from seeds), they also have important differences that make them distinct
  from one another. Flaxseed oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids and has been studied
  for its potential health benefits related to heart disease and inflammation. Pumpkin
  seed oil, on the other hand, contains antioxidants and has been linked to improved
  bladder function and prostate health. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
