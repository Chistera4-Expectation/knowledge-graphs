  Rooibos tea and Yerba mate tea are two different types of teas with distinct origins,
  flavors, and nutritional profiles. Rooibos tea is a caffeine-free herbal tea made
  from the leaves of the Rooibos plant, which is native to South Africa. Yerba mate
  tea, on the other hand, is a traditional South American caffeinated tea made from
  the dried leaves of the Ilex paraguariensis plant. While both teas have some similarities
  in terms of their antioxidant content and potential health benefits, they are not
  interchangeable and can be considered separate entities. Therefore, they should
  not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
