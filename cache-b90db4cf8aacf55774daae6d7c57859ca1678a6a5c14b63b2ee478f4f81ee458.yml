text: ' No. Corn oil and walnut oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged together. While they both fall under the category of edible
  vegetable oils, they come from different sources (corn vs. walnuts) and have distinct
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to keep them
  separate and maintain their unique identities.'
