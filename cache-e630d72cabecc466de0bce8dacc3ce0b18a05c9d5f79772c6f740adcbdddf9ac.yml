  Although black rice and cooked white rice can both fall under the general category
  of "rice," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different
  nutritional profiles, flavors, textures, and culinary uses, so it is important to
  distinguish between them. Merging these two concepts would result in loss of valuable
  information about their unique characteristics.'
