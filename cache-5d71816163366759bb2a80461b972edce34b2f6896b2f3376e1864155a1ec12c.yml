text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of seasonings
  with distinct flavor profiles and cultural origins. Italian seasoning typically
  consists of dried herbs like basil, oregano, thyme, and rosemary, while soy sauce
  is a fermented liquid condiment commonly used in Asian cuisine. Although both can
  be used for seasoning, their ingredients, uses, and flavor profiles are different.
