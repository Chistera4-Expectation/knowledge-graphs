text: No, "Crab meat" and "Dungeness Crab" should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both types of crab, they refer to different aspects of
  the crab. "Crab meat" refers to the edible flesh of any crab, while "Dungeness Crab"
  is a specific species of crab. They have different nutritional profiles and can
  be used in different recipes, so it is important to distinguish between them.
