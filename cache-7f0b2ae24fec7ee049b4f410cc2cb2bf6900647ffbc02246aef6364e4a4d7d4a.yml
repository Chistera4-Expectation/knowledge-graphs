  While both "pork belly" and "salt pork" are derived from pork, they refer to different
  cuts of meat with distinct textures and flavors. Pork belly is a fatty cut of meat
  that is often cured and smoked to make bacon, while salt pork is a leaner cut that
  is typically salted and dried to preserve it for later use. They have different
  culinary uses and preparation methods, so it would not be appropriate to merge them
  as duplicates.'
