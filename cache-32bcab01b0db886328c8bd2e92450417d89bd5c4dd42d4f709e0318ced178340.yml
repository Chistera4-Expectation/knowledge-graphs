  While Chinkiang vinegar and rice vinegar are both types of vinegars used in cooking
  and have similar uses, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They differ
  in their taste, aroma, and acidity levels due to differences in production methods
  and ingredients. Chinkiang vinegar is a dark, richly flavored vinegar made from
  glutinous rice and wheat bran, while rice vinegar is typically lighter in color
  and flavor and can be made from various types of rice. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge these two concepts as duplicates.'
