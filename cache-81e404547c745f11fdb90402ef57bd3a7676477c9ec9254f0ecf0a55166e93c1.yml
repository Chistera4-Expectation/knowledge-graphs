text: ' No. Coconut oil and extra virgin olive oil are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they may both fall under the broader category of edible vegetable
  oils, they have distinct chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, and uses in
  cooking and food preparation. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate categories
  for them.'
