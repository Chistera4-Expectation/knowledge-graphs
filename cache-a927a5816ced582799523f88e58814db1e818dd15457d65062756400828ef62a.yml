text: No, they should not be merged as they have different compositions and uses in
  cooking. Chinese five-spice powder is a blend of five or more spices, typically
  including star anise, cloves, Chinese cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds.
  Garlic powder, on the other hand, is simply dehydrated and ground garlic. They both
  contribute different flavors and aromas to dishes.
