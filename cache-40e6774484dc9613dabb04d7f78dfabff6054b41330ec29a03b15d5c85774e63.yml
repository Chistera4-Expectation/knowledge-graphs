text: 'No, Hydrogen Water and Mineral Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their composition and properties.


  Hydrogen Water typically refers to water that has had hydrogen gas infused into
  it, resulting in a higher concentration of dissolved hydrogen. This type of water
  is often marketed for its potential health benefits, such as antioxidant properties
  and improved cellular energy production.


  Mineral Water, on the other hand, is water that naturally contains minerals and
  trace elements, such as calcium, magnesium, and sodium. The mineral content of mineral
  water can vary depending on the source, and it is often promoted for its potential
  health benefits due to the presence of these minerals.


  Although both types of water can be consumed for their potential health benefits,
  they have different compositions and properties, and therefore should not be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates.'
