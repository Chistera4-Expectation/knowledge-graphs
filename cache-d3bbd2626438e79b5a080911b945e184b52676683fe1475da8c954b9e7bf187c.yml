text: ' ''Edible Vegetable'' would be the most appropriate class for ''Vegetables.''
  This is because it specifically refers to plants that are consumed as part of a
  meal, and vegetables fall under this category. While other options such as ''Edible
  Fruits,'' ''Edible Mushrooms,'' ''Edible Seaweed,'' and ''Edible Seeds'' also include
  various types of healthy foods, they do not cover all vegetable varieties. Classes
  like ''Bread,'' ''Breakfast Cereals,'' ''Edible Vegetable Oils,'' ''Pasta Types,''
  and ''Rice'' refer to specific kinds of food products rather than broad categories
  of edible plant matter.'
