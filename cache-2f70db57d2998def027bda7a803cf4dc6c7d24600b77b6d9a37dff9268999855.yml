text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are yogurts, they have different
  nutritional profiles. Fat-Free Yogurt is derived from dairy and has no fat, while
  Non-Dairy Yogurt is made from plant-based sources and does not contain any dairy.
  These differences in ingredients and nutritional content make them distinct instances
  in the Yogurt class.
