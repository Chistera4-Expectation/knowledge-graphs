text: No, "Chicken Patties" and "Guinea Fowl Patties" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are poultry-derived food items
  and share the common characteristic of being patties, they are derived from different
  types of poultry and may have different nutritional profiles and cooking methods.
  Maintaining separate class instances allows for more accurate representation of
  the distinct characteristics and information about each type of poultry patty.
