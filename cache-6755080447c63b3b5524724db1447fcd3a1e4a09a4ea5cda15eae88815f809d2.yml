  Ranch dressing and Sesame Ginger dressing are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They have different ingredients, flavors, and uses. Semantic duplicates refer to
  concepts that have the same meaning, while ontological duplicates refer to objects
  that belong to the same category but may differ in attributes. Ranch dressing is
  typically creamy with herbs and spices, while Sesame Ginger dressing has an Asian-inspired
  flavor profile with sesame oil, ginger, and soy sauce. Therefore, they serve distinct
  purposes in terms of taste preferences and dish compatibility.'
