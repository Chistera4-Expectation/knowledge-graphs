text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of fish preparations
  and have distinct characteristics and uses. Sashimi-grade fish refers to high-quality,
  fresh fish suitable for sashimi (thinly sliced raw fish) consumption, while stockfish
  refers to dried fish that has been preserved for later use. They are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
