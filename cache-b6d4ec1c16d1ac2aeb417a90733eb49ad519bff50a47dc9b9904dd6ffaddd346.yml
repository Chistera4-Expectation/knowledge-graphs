text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Pheasant Broth' and 'Pheasant Gravy' are derived from poultry, they have different
  culinary uses and compositions. Pheasant Broth is typically a clear liquid made
  by simmering pheasant meat and bones in water, while Pheasant Gravy is a thickened
  sauce made from the drippings and juices from cooked pheasant, often combined with
  a thickening agent such as flour or cornstarch.
