text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are edible vegetal oils, they are derived from different plants and have distinct
  properties, nutritional values, and uses. Safflower oil comes from the seeds of
  the safflower plant, while walnut oil comes from the walnut tree. They have different
  fatty acid profiles, flavors, and applications in cooking and other uses.
