  While both fresh basil leaves and bitter leaf are types of vegetation that can be
  used for culinary purposes, they have distinct characteristics, flavors, nutritional
  profiles, and cultural uses. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. It is important to maintain their unique identities
  within the edible vegetable class.'
