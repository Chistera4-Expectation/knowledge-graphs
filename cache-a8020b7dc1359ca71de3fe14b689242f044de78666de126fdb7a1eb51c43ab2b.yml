text: ' No. While both Lemon Juice Dressing and Teriyaki Dressing contain various
  ingredients and may serve similar functions in some contexts (i.e., used as salad
  dressings), they are distinct food items with unique characteristics. Lemon Juice
  Dressing is primarily made of lemon juice, oil, vinegar, sugar, and spices, while
  Teriyaki Dressing consists mainly of soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, garlic, ginger,
  and sometimes other seasonings. Their preparation methods, flavor profiles, and
  cultural origins differ significantly. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
