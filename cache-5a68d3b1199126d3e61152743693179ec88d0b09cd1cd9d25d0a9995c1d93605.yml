text: ' No, cantaloupe seeds and mustard seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of seeds, they come from different
  plants, have different nutritional profiles, and are used in different ways in cooking
  and food preparation. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entities
  in a dietetics context.'
