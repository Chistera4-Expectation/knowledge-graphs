text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of fish. Fish
  stock typically refers to the broth made from fish bones and other ingredients,
  while Redfish is a specific type of fish (commonly referring to red drum or ocean
  perch). Merging them would not accurately reflect the differences in their nature
  and usage.
