text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  they both refer to tomatoes, they have different forms and are used differently
  in recipes. Canned crushed tomatoes are already mashed into a paste, while diced
  tomatoes are in chunks. They have distinct culinary uses and should be considered
  separate instances within the Edible Vegetable class.
