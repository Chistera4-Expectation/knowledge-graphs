text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  "Chicken Tenders" and "Pheasant Tenders" are derived from poultry, they are different
  types of poultry and can have distinct nutritional profiles, cooking methods, and
  taste characteristics. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
