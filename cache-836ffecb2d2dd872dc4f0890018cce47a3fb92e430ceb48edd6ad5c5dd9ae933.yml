  While both ''finely chopped scallions'' and ''onions'' are types of vegetables,
  they are not duplicate entries. Scallions and onions are two different plants with
  distinct flavors, textures, and culinary uses. They can be used in similar dishes,
  but they have different nutritional profiles and cannot be considered interchangeable.
  Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them as separate instances in the Edible Vegetable
  class.'
