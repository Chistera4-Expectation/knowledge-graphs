  While both "Chicken tacos" and "Rotisserie chicken" are poultry-derived foods, they
  do not represent the same type of food product or meal category. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. Chicken
  tacos typically refer to a dish made with tortillas, vegetables, seasonings, and
  cooked chicken pieces (often from rotisserie chickens), while rotisserie chicken
  is an entire cooked chicken prepared using a specific cooking technique that results
  in juicy meat and crispy skin.'
