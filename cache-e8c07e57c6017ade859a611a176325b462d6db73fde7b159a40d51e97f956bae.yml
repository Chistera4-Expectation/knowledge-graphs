text: ' No. Acacia honey and creamed honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They refer to different types of honey with distinct
  characteristics. Acacia honey is a type of honey produced from the nectar of the
  acacia tree, while creamed honey is honey that has been processed to create a spreadable
  consistency. Although they may both fall under the category of "honey," they have
  unique properties and uses.'
