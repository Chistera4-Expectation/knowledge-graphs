text: ' No. While "Chicken parmesan" does contain chicken as an ingredient, it is
  not a duplicate of "Chicken." Chicken parmesan is a specific dish that includes
  breaded chicken topped with tomato sauce and melted cheese, whereas chicken simply
  refers to meat from a domestic fowl. Therefore, they have different meanings and
  uses in a culinary context.'
