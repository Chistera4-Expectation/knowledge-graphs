text: No, Ostrich Broth and Pheasant Broth should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they both belong to the Poultry-derived Food class, they are
  derived from different types of birds (ostrich and pheasant) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles and flavor characteristics.
