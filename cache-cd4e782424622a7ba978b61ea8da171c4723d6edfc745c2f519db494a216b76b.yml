  While both "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Fried Chicken" are poultry-derived foods,
  they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they differ
  significantly in their nutritional profiles, ingredients, preparation methods, and
  culinary uses. Merging them would not accurately reflect their unique characteristics
  and meanings within the context of food classification.'
