text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are rice-based, they represent
  different types of rice preparation. Parboiled rice is a method of partially boiling
  rice in the husk, while rice rolls are a type of dish where rice is used as a wrapper
  or filling. They serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.
