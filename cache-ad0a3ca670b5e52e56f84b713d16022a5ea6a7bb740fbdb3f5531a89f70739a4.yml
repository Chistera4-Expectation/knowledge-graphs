text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from poultry,
  they are distinct food items with different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking.
  Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are a cut of meat that can be cooked and consumed
  directly, while chicken stock is a liquid made by simmering chicken bones and other
  ingredients, which is typically used as a base for soups, sauces, and other dishes.
