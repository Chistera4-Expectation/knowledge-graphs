text: No, they should not be merged. While both "Beet juice" and "Juice" are related,
  they represent different types of juice. "Beet juice" is a specific type of juice
  made from beets, while "Juice" is a more general term that encompasses various types
  of fruit and vegetable juices. Merging them would not accurately represent the distinct
  nature of each type of juice.
