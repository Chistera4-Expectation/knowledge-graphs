text: ' The most adequate class for canned diced tomatoes would be "Edible Vegetable."
  This is because canned diced tomatoes are made from tomatoes, which are a type of
  vegetable. Other classes that might also be suitable include "Food Seasoning" or
  "Sauce," as diced tomatoes are often used in these capacities, but "Edible Vegetable"
  is the broadest and most inclusive category.'
