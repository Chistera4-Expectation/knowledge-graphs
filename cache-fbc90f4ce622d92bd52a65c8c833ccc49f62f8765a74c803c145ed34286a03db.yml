text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct ingredients and nutritional
  profiles. Vegan Yogurt is made from plant-based sources like almonds, soy, or coconut,
  while Whole Milk Yogurt is made from cow's milk. These differences significantly
  affect the nutritional content, taste, and texture of the yogurts.
