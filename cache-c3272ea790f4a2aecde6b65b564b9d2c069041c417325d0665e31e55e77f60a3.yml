text: ' No. Creamed honey and strawberry honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. They are different types of honey products
  with distinct characteristics. Creamed honey is honey that has been whipped to make
  it smooth and creamy, while strawberry honey is regular honey infused with the flavor
  of strawberries. Therefore, they can exist as separate instances within the "Honey"
  class.'
