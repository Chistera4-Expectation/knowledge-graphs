  While both "chicken breast" and "fried chicken" are types of poultry-derived food,
  they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they have
  different nutritional profiles and cooking methods that result in distinct culinary
  experiences. Chicken breast is generally leaner with higher protein content than
  fried chicken, which has added fat from breading and deep-frying. Merging these
  terms would not accurately reflect their unique characteristics.'
