text: ' No. While both ''Calories per teaspoon'' and ''Stevia'' are related to the
  topic of sweeteners, they do not represent duplicate concepts. The former is a measurement
  of energy content, while the latter is a specific type of natural low-calorie sweetener.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
