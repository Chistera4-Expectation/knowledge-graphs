text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Electrolyte Water' and 'Hydrogen
  Water' can be considered types of drinking water, they have different properties
  and purposes. Electrolyte water contains minerals and electrolytes to help maintain
  hydration and balance in the body, while hydrogen water contains dissolved hydrogen
  gas, which is believed to have antioxidant properties and potential health benefits.
  Therefore, they should not be considered semantic or ontologic duplicates.
