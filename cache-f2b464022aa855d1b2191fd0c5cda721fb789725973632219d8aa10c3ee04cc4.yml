text: No, Glutinous Rice and Rice Rolls should not be merged as they are distinct
  types of rice with different characteristics and uses in cuisine. Glutinous Rice
  refers to a specific type of rice that is high in starch and has a sticky texture
  when cooked, while Rice Rolls are a dish made from cooked rice wrapped in a thin
  sheet of rice paper or other ingredients.
