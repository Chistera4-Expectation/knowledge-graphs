text: No, they should not be merged together. Pork Cutlet and Salt Pork are different
  types of pork-derived foods with distinct characteristics, preparation methods,
  and uses in recipes. Pork Cutlet is a thin, boneless, breaded cut of pork, while
  Salt Pork is a cured, unsmoked pork product typically used in cooking rather than
  being served as a standalone dish. They should be treated as separate instances
  in the Pork-derived Food class.
