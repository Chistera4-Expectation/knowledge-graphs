text: As a dietician, my expertise is in nutrition rather than computer science or
  linguistics. However, based on the names alone, it seems that 'Cuban bread' and
  'Grilled Bread' are different types of bread with distinct characteristics. Cuban
  bread is a type of bread with a specific recipe and origin, while grilled bread
  refers to any bread that has been grilled, regardless of the type of bread. Therefore,
  I would suggest that these two instances should not be merged as they represent
  different types of bread.
