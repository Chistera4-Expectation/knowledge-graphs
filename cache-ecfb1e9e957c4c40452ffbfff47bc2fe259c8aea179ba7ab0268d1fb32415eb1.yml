text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are derived from chicken, they
  have significant differences in nutritional content and preparation methods. Boneless,
  skinless chicken breasts are lean and high in protein, while chicken nuggets often
  contain added fats, breading, and may be deep-fried, making them less healthy and
  having a different nutritional profile.
