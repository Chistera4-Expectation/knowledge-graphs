text: No, "Duck Patties" and "Duck Tenders" should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are derived from duck, they are different types of food
  with distinct shapes and preparation methods. "Duck Patties" are typically flattened
  and formed into patties, while "Duck Tenders" are cut into strips or pieces. These
  differences in form and presentation warrant separate categorization.
