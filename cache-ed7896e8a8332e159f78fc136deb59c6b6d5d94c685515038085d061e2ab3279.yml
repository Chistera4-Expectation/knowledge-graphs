text: No, White Rice and Wild Rice should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are different types of rice with distinct characteristics, nutritional
  profiles, and culinary uses. White Rice is a refined grain with a higher glycemic
  index and lower fiber content, while Wild Rice is a whole grain with a lower glycemic
  index and higher fiber content. Merging them would lead to a loss of important information
  and misrepresentation of their unique properties.
