text: As a dietician, my answer is no. Challah Bread and Cornbread are distinct types
  of bread with different ingredients, textures, and flavors. While they both fall
  under the broader category of bread, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They can coexist in the Bread class as separate instances with their
  own unique characteristics.
