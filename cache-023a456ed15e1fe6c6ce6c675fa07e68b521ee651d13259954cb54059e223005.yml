text: No, 'Ground Pork' and 'Pork Tenderloin' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both pork-derived foods, they are different
  cuts of meat with distinct characteristics, textures, and uses in cooking. Merging
  them would create confusion and inaccurate categorization in a dietician's database
  or system.
