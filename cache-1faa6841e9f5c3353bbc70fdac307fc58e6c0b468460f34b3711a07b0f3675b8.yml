text: ' No. Olive oil and palm oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates, even
  though they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils. They come from
  different plants (olives vs. palm fruit) and have distinct nutritional profiles
  and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate instances.'
