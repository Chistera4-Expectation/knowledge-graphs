text: ' No. While both "Optional protein" and "Optional" may seem related to the topic
  of dietary options, they do not mean the same thing and serve different purposes
  in categorizing beef dishes. "Optional protein" specifically refers to cases where
  protein can be added or removed from a dish, while "Optional" has a broader meaning
  that could apply to any ingredient or component of a dish. Therefore, it is appropriate
  for them to remain separate categories within the context of a beef class.'
