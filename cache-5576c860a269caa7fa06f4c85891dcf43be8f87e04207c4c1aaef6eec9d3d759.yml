text: ' No. Turmeric powder and white pepper powder are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they may both belong to the broader category of "spices."
  They have different tastes, appearances, uses, nutritional profiles, and chemical
  compositions. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates
  from a culinary, nutritional, or botanical perspective.'
