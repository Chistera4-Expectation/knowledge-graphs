  While both "chicken pieces" and "chicken soup" are poultry-derived foods, they cannot
  be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer to different
  food items with distinct nutritional profiles and uses. Chicken pieces generally
  consist of various cuts from chicken carcasses (such as breasts, thighs, wings),
  which can be prepared and consumed in multiple ways. On the other hand, chicken
  soup is a liquid dish made by cooking chicken parts in water along with seasonings,
  vegetables, and sometimes grains or starches. Therefore, these two instances represent
  unique concepts within the context of poultry-derived foods.'
