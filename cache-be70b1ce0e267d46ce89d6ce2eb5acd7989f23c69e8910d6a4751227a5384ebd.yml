text: No, they should not be merged together as they represent distinct types of yogurt
  with unique characteristics, flavors, and uses. Bulgarian Yogurt is a traditional
  yogurt originating from Bulgaria, while Lassi Yogurt is a yogurt-based drink that
  is popular in India. Although they are both yogurts, they have different properties
  and uses, making them separate entities in the Yogurt class.
