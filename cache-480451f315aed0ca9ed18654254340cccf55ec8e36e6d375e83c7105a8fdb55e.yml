text: ' No, Grass-fed beef and Organic beef are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. While both types of beef have different production methods,
  they refer to distinct characteristics of the meat. Grass-fed beef refers to the

  they were fed, without using synthetic pesticides, genetically modified organisms,
  antibiotics, and growth hormones.'
