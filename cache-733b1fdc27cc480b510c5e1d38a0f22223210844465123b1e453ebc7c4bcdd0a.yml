text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of yogurt, they
  have distinct characteristics and properties. Frozen yogurt is typically a frozen
  dessert made from yogurt, while fruit-flavored yogurt is yogurt with added fruit
  flavoring. They should be treated as separate instances in the Yogurt class.
