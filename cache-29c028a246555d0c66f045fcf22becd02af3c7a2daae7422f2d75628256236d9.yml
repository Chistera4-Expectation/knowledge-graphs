text: No, the instances 'Guinea Fowl Wings' and 'Ostrich Wings' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of poultry,
  and although they both refer to wings, they are not the same species. Guinea fowl
  and ostrich are distinct species with different nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses.
