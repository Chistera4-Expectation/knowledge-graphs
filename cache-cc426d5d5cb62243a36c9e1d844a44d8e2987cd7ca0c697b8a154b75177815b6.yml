text: "As a dietician, I can provide some input on the topic, but the classification\
  \ of water types is not within my area of expertise. However, from a general perspective,\
  \ 'Purified Water' and 'Soft Water' are not necessarily the same thing. \n\nPurified\
  \ Water is water that has been mechanically filtered or processed to remove impurities\
  \ and make it suitable for consumption. It can be created through various methods,\
  \ including distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or carbon filtration.\n\
  \nSoft Water, on the other hand, refers to water with a low mineral content, particularly\
  \ calcium and magnesium. Soft water is typically created by treating hard water\
  \ with a water softener, which removes the minerals responsible for water hardness.\n\
  \nWhile both purified water and soft water can be considered 'clean' and safe to\
  \ drink, they are not the same thing. Purified water focuses on removing impurities,\
  \ while soft water focuses on reducing mineral content. Therefore, they should not\
  \ be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates."
