text: No, English Breakfast Tea and Lemon Tea should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of tea, they have distinct flavors
  and ingredients. English Breakfast Tea is typically a blend of black teas, while
  Lemon Tea usually contains lemon flavoring or lemon-infused water. These differences
  in flavor and composition make them distinct entities in the Tea class.
