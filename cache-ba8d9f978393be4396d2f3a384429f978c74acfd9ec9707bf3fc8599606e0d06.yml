  While both Blueberry Honey and Sage Honey fall under the category of "Honey," they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different properties
  and origins. Blueberry Honey is made by honeybees that gather nectar from blueberry
  flowers, while Sage Honey comes from honeybees collecting nectar from sage plants.
  These differences can affect their taste, color, aroma, and nutritional profiles,
  making them unique subtypes within the Honey classification. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two types of honey as duplicates.'
