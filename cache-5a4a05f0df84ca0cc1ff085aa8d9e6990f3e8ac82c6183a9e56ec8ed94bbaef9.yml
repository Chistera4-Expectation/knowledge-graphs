text: No, Raspberry Honey and Raw Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different types of honey with distinct characteristics
  and flavors. Raspberry Honey is produced by bees that collect nectar from raspberry
  flowers, while Raw Honey is unprocessed, unheated, and unpasteurized honey. Although
  both are types of honey, they have different properties and should not be considered
  duplicates.
