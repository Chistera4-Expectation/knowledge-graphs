text: No, Arborio Rice and Sushi Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have different
  properties and uses in cooking. Arborio Rice is an Italian short-grain rice commonly
  used in risotto dishes, while Sushi Rice is a Japanese short-grain rice used for
  sushi and sashimi dishes, with a specific preparation method to achieve the desired
  texture and flavor.
