text: No, "Ostrich Meatballs" and "Ostrich Nuggets" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from ostrich
  meat, they have different shapes and preparation methods, which make them distinct
  food items within the Poultry-derived Food class.
