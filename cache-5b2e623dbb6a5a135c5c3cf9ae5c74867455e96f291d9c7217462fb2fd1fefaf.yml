text: ' No. Flaxseeds (also known as linseeds) and pumpkin seeds are distinct types
  of edible seeds with unique nutritional profiles and characteristics. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic or ontological duplicates. Here are some differences
  between flaxseeds and pumpkin seeds:


  * Nutrient content: Both flaxseeds and pumpkin seeds have different amounts and
  ratios of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), vitamins, minerals, and
  other bioactive compounds. For example, flaxseeds contain more fiber and omega-3
  fatty acids than pumpkin seeds, while pumpkin seeds provide more iron and zinc.

  * Culinary uses: Flaxseeds and pumpkin seeds can be used differently in cooking
  and baking. Flaxseeds can be ground into a meal or gelatinized to make a vegan substitute
  for eggs, while whole or chopped pumpkin seeds can be added to salads, soups, granolas,
  or roasted as a snack.

  * Cultural significance: Flaxseeds and pumpkin seeds have diverse historical and
  cultural associations that reflect their geographical origins and traditional uses.
  Flax is one of the oldest cultivated crops in human history, originating from the
  Fertile Crescent region around 10,000 years ago, and has been valued for its fibers,
  oils, and medicinal properties by various civilizations such as ancient Egyptians,
  Greeks, Romans, Chinese, Indians, and Europeans. Pumpkins, on the other hand, are
  native to North America and were domesticated by indigenous peoples around 7,500-5,000
  years ago, who used them for food, ritualistic purposes, and decorations during
  harvest festivals like Thanksgiving.


  In conclusion, flaxseeds and pumpkin seeds deserve separate identities due to their
  distinct features and values. Merging them would result in loss of information and
  accuracy regarding their individual benefits and applications.'
