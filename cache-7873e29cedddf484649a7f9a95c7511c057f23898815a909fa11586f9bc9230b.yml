  While both vegetable broth and beef broth can serve similar culinary purposes (as
  a liquid base for cooking), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  their ingredients differ fundamentally: vegetable broth is made solely from vegetables,
  while beef broth is made primarily from animal products, typically bones and meat.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as identical.'
