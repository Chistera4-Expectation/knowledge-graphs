  Rice flour and sushi rice are not semantic or ontological duplicates, as they refer
  to different types of rice products with distinct uses and properties. Rice flour
  is made by grinding rice into a fine powder, which can then be used as a gluten-free
  alternative to wheat flour for baking and cooking purposes. Sushi rice, on the other
  hand, refers specifically to short-grain Japanese rice that has been cooked and
  seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt to give it its characteristic sticky texture,
  which is essential for making traditional sushi rolls and dishes. Therefore, these
  two terms should not be merged as duplicates.'
