text: ' No. Five-spice powder and onion powder are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. They are two distinct seasonings with different ingredients
  and flavors. Five-spice powder is a blend of five spices commonly used in Chinese
  cuisine, typically including star anise, cloves, cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel
  seeds. Onion powder, on the other hand, is made from dehydrated and ground onions
  and is used to add onion flavor to dishes without adding moisture.'
