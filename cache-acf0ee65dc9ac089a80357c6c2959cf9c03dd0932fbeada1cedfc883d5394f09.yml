text: No, 'Brown rice syrup' and 'Maltose syrup' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. They have different chemical compositions and
  origins, even though they share some similarities in terms of being sweeteners derived
  from carbohydrates. Brown rice syrup is derived from brown rice, while maltose syrup
  is derived from malted grains.
