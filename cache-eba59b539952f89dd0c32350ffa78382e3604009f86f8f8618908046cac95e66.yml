text: ' No. Chia seeds and grape seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While both are types of seeds, they come from
  different plants (chia seeds from Salvia hispanica and grape seeds from Vitis vinifera)
  and have different nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is important to keep them
  separate when discussing their respective health benefits and uses.'
