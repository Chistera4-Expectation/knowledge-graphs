text: ' The most adequate class for "Tea" among the given options would be simply
  "Tea". This is because tea is not an alcoholic drink, it does not contain significant
  amounts of caffeine like coffee, it is not necessarily fortified with added nutrients
  or energy-boosting ingredients like milk or energy drinks, and it is not naturally
  occurring water or juice from fruit. Tea is its own distinct category of beverage.'
