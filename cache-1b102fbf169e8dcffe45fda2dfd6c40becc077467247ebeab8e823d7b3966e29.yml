text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  "Pheasant Gravy" and "Pheasant Nuggets" are derived from poultry, they are different
  food products with distinct culinary uses and preparations. Pheasant Gravy is a
  sauce made from pheasant, while Pheasant Nuggets are bite-sized pieces of pheasant
  meat that are typically breaded and fried.
