text: Yes, the instances 'Red wine vinegar' and 'Vinegar' should be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates since red wine vinegar is a specific type of
  vinegar. However, it's essential to consider the context and the specific classification
  system used, as there may be cases where they need to be treated as separate entities
  due to differences in properties or applications.
