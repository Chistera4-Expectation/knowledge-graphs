text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'Juice' and 'Strawberry
  juice' are related concepts, they represent different types of juice. 'Juice' is
  a more general concept, while 'Strawberry juice' is a specific type of juice made
  from strawberries. Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and detail
  in the classification.
