text: ' No. While lasagna noodles and regular noodles can both be used in pasta dishes,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Lasagna noodles are typically wide
  and flat with ridged edges, designed to hold thick meaty sauces and cheeses in casserole-style
  dishes like lasagna. Regular noodles come in various shapes and sizes (e.g., spaghetti,
  fettuccine, macaroni), intended for different types of sauces and cooking methods.
  Merging them would result in loss of meaningful distinctions between these two pasta
  varieties.'
