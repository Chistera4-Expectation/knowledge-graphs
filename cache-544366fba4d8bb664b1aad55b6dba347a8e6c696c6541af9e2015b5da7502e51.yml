text: No, Corn and Cornstarch should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they both originate from the same plant, they have different
  nutritional properties and uses in cooking and food preparation. Corn is a whole
  food, while cornstarch is a processed food ingredient derived from corn.
