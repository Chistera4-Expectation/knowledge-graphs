  Honey is a natural sweetener that contains fructose and glucose, providing calories
  and carbohydrates when consumed. Stevia, on the other hand, is also a natural sweetener
  but it is much sweeter than sugar with minimal to zero calories since it does not
  contain any fructose or glucose. Therefore, they have different nutritional profiles
  and merging them would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.'
