text: No, Soda Bread and White Bread should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates, as they are distinct types of bread with different ingredients and preparation
  methods. While they both fall under the broader category of bread, they have unique
  characteristics that warrant separate instances in the Bread class.
