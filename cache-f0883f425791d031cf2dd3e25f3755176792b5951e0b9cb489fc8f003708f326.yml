  While brown rice and cooked white rice may have some similarities as types of rice,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they differ in important
  ways such as nutritional content, culinary uses, and preparation methods. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them as separate instances in a knowledge base.'
