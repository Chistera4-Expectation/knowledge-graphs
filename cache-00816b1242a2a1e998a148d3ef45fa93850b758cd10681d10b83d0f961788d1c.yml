  While both pork fat and pork ribs are derived from pigs and can be considered part
  of the broader category of "pork," they have distinct nutritional profiles and uses
  in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates in this context.


  Pork fat is high in calories and saturated fats and is often used for cooking and
  baking purposes, while pork ribs contain protein, B vitamins, and minerals like
  iron, zinc, and magnesium, making them a more substantial source of nutrition than
  pure pork fat. Merging these two concepts would obscure their unique properties
  and potential health implications.'
