  While ginger paste and chili bean paste may both be considered food seasonings,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantically, they have different
  meanings and uses in cooking. Ginger paste is typically made from ground fresh ginger
  root, while chili bean paste (also known as doubanjiang) is a fermented sauce made
  from broad beans, soybeans, chilies, salt, and spices. Ontologically, these two
  pastes belong to different categories of ingredients with distinct flavors and purposes
  in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
