text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. While Black Tea and Rooibos Tea are both
  types of tea, they have distinct characteristics and properties. Black Tea comes
  from the Camellia sinensis plant and contains caffeine, whereas Rooibos Tea, also
  known as Red Tea, comes from the Aspalathus linearis plant and is caffeine-free.
  Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
