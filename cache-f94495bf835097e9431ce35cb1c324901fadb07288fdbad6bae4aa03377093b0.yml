text: As a dietician, my answer is based on the nutritional content and usage of the
  sauces, not purely on semantics or ontology. From a nutritional perspective, chili
  sauce and mustard sauce are not exact duplicates. Chili sauce typically contains
  more sugar and spices, while mustard sauce is made from mustard seeds and vinegar.
  However, if you are referring to them as duplicates in terms of their purpose and
  role in a meal, then they might be considered as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  But from a dietician's standpoint, I would not merge them together as they have
  different nutritional profiles.
