text: ' No. While "bread" is a general category of food that includes many different
  types such as French bread, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  have distinct properties and characteristics that make them unique within the broader
  category of bread. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions between
  different kinds of bread.'
