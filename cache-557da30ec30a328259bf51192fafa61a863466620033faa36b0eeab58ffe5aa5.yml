text: No, Alkaline Water and Glacier Water should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are types of drinking water, they have distinct properties
  and characteristics. Alkaline water has a higher pH level than regular water, while
  glacier water comes from melting glaciers and may have different mineral content
  and taste. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances in a drinking
  water classification.
