text: ' No. Although both "brand" and "name" represent strings, they refer to different
  concepts. The "brand" refers to the manufacturer or distributor of the pasta, while
  the "name" represents the specific type or variety of pasta from that brand. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
