  Bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina) is a specific type of leafy green vegetable that
  has a bitter taste and is commonly consumed in certain parts of the world for its
  medicinal properties and nutritional value. Other leafy greens, on the other hand,
  can refer to any plant with edible leaves, such as spinach, kale, collard greens,
  etc., which may have varying tastes, textures, and nutrient profiles. While both
  bitter leaf and other leafy greens belong to the same general category of vegetables,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they do not represent exactly
  the same thing.'
