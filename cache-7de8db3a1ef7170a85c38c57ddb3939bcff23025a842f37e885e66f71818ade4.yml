  While both Acacia honey and regular honey are types of honey, they have different
  properties that may be relevant when considering them from a dietary perspective.
  For example, Acacia honey has a milder taste and is lower on the glycemic index
  compared to other honeys. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two concepts as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
