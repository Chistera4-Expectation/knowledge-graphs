text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are milk alternatives, they
  have different ingredients and nutritional profiles. Cashew milk is made from cashew
  nuts, while lactose-free milk is made from cow's milk that has had the lactose removed.
  They should be treated as separate entities in the Milk class.
