text: No, they should not be merged. Although both Almond Milk and Flaxseed Milk are
  non-dairy milk alternatives, they are distinct products made from different plant
  sources. They have different nutritional profiles and flavors. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the variety of plant-based milk options available.
