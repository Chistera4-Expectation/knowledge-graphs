  While pork belly and pork ribs are both cuts of meat from a pig, they have different
  culinary uses, nutritional profiles, and cultural significance. Therefore, it is
  not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. They can coexist
  as distinct items within the Pork-derived Food class.'
