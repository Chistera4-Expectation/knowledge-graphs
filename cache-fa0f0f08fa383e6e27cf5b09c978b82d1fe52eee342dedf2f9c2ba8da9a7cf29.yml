text: No, the instances 'Curry sauce' and 'Mole sauce' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of sauce, they have
  distinct ingredients, flavors, and cultural origins. Merging them would result in
  a loss of information and specificity in describing each sauce.
