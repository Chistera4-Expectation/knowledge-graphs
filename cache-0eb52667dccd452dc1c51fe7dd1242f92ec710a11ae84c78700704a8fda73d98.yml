  While both chopped and diced onions refer to cutting up an onion into small pieces,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they differ in size and
  shape. Dicing involves cutting the onion into uniformly sized and shaped cubes,
  while chopping results in irregularly-shaped pieces that vary in size. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep these two terms distinct from one another.'
