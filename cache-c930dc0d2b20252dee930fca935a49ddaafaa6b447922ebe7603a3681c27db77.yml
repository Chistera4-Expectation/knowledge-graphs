text: No, Quail Gizzards and Quail Meat should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they both come from quails, they are different parts of the
  animal with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Quail Gizzards are
  a specific muscle found in the digestive tract of the bird, while Quail Meat refers
  to the general edible flesh of the quail. Merging them would result in loss of information
  and clarity.
