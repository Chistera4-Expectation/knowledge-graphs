text: ' No. Although turmeric powder is made from the ground roots of the turmeric
  plant (Curcuma longa), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Turmeric
  typically refers to the rhizome of Curcuma longa, which has its own set of uses
  and properties beyond just being ground into powder form. Merging them would lose
  this important distinction.'
