text: No, "Ostrich Drumsticks" and "Ostrich Soup" should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they both are derived from ostriches, they are different
  food items with distinct preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived foods available.
