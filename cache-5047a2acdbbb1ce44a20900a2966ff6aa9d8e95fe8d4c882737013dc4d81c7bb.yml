text: ' No. Linden honey and organic clover honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, even though they both belong to the category of honey. They have distinct
  botanical origins (linden trees vs. clover plants) that can affect their taste,
  color, and nutritional profile. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate
  instances representing different types of honey.'
