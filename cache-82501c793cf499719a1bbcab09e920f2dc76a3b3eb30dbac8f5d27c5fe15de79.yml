text: ' No. Smoked turkey is a specific form of processed turkey, while the statement
  about turkey being similar to chicken with many forms refers more generally to various
  ways that turkey can be prepared or presented (e.g., ground, breast meat, whole
  bird). Therefore, they are not exact duplicates and should not be merged.'
