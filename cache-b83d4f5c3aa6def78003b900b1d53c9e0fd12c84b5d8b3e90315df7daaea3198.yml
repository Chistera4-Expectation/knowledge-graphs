text: ' No. Blackberry honey and sage honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They have distinct characteristics
  based on their source: blackberry honey is made by bees that collect nectar from
  blackberry flowers, while sage honey comes from bees collecting nectar from sage
  plants. These differences result in unique flavors, colors, and nutritional profiles
  for each type of honey. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as
  duplicates.'
