text: 'As a dietician, I can provide an informed perspective, but the final decision
  should involve domain experts in water quality, purification, and classification.


  Merging ''Rain Water'' and ''Water'' as semantic and ontological duplicates would
  depend on the context and the specific purpose of the classification system. In
  general, ''Rain Water'' is a type of ''Water'' that has been naturally purified
  through the process of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. However, they
  are not entirely identical, as ''Water'' can encompass a broader range of sources,
  such as groundwater, surface water, and treated water.


  In a Drinking Water class, it may be helpful to distinguish between different types
  of water sources, including rainwater, to provide a more comprehensive understanding
  of the topic. If the classification system aims to focus on the purification and
  treatment of water for human consumption, it may be appropriate to merge the two
  instances, as the purification process would be similar for both rainwater and other
  water sources.


  In conclusion, the decision to merge ''Rain Water'' and ''Water'' as semantic and
  ontological duplicates in a Drinking Water class should consider the specific context
  and purpose of the classification system.'
