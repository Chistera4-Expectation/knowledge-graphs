text: ' No. In general, ''Potato'' and ''Potatoes'' are not considered to be semantic
  and ontological duplicates because they refer to different grammatical forms of
  the same concept. ''Potato'' is typically used as a singular noun to refer to an
  individual tuber vegetable, while ''potatoes'' is the plural form that refers to
  multiple potatoes. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate to accurately
  reflect their distinct uses in language.'
