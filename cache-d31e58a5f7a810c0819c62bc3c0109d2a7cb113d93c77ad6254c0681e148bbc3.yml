text: ' No. While both "Fresh raw fish" and "Stock fish" are types of edible fish,
  they refer to distinct concepts with different properties and uses. Fresh raw fish
  refers to untreated, freshly caught fish that is intended for immediate consumption
  or short-term storage, while stock fish refers to fish that has been preserved through
  a process of salting and drying, allowing it to be stored for longer periods and
  used in various culinary applications. Therefore, merging them would not accurately
  reflect their unique meanings and characteristics.'
