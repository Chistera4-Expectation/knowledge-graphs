text: No, 'Flavored Water' and 'Infused Water' should not be merged together as they
  have distinct differences in their composition and preparation methods. Flavored
  water typically contains added flavors, sweeteners, or other ingredients, while
  infused water is made by steeping fruits, vegetables, or herbs in water. While they
  both involve adding flavor to water, they are different in terms of their ingredients
  and preparation techniques.
