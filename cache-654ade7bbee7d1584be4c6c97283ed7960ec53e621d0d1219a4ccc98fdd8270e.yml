  The terms "sunflower oil" and "vegetable oil" are not exact synonyms, as they refer
  to different types of edible oils with distinct flavors, nutritional profiles, and
  production processes. Sunflower oil is extracted from sunflower seeds, while vegetable
  oil can be derived from various plant sources such as soybeans, corn, canola, or
  a blend of several oils. Although both can be used for cooking and share some similarities
  in their chemical composition, they have distinguishable characteristics that set
  them apart. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
