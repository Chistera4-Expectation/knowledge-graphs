text: No, Chili Powder and Kashmiri Chili Powder should not be merged together as
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the spice
  class and are derived from chilies, they have distinct characteristics, such as
  flavor, heat intensity, and color. Merging them would lead to loss of this valuable
  information.
