text: No, Basmati Rice and Brown Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both types of rice, they have distinct nutritional profiles
  and characteristics. Basmati Rice is a long-grain rice variety with a lower glycemic
  index, while Brown Rice is a whole grain with a higher nutritional value due to
  its bran and germ content. Merging them would not accurately represent their differences
  and could lead to confusion when providing dietary advice.
