text: No, the instances 'Fish fillet' and 'Fish stock' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both involve fish, they represent
  different types of food products. A fish fillet is a cut of fish meat, while fish
  stock is a liquid made by simmering fish bones and other ingredients. They have
  different nutritional values and uses in cooking.
