text: ' No. While "Pork roast" and "Roasted pork" may seem similar, they are not necessarily
  the same thing and do not have to refer to the exact same dish. For example, "Pork
  roast" could refer to a specific cut of meat that is roasted, while "Roasted park"
  could refer more generally to any type of pork that has been cooked by roasting.
  Additionally, there may be differences in how the dishes are prepared or seasoned,
  which would further distinguish them from one another. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
