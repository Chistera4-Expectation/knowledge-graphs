text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are tomato-based products,
  they have distinct characteristics and uses. Canned crushed tomatoes are processed
  and have a different texture compared to fresh tomatoes. They are often used in
  sauces, stews, and soups, while fresh tomatoes can be used in salads, sandwiches,
  or eaten raw. Maintaining them as separate instances allows for more accurate classification
  and information about each product.
