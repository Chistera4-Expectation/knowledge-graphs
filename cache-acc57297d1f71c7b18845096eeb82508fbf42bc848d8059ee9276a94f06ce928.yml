text: No, the instances 'Coconut Milk' and 'Sheep's Milk' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the broader category
  of "milk," they are derived from different sources and have distinct nutritional
  profiles. Coconut milk is derived from the flesh of coconuts, while sheep's milk
  comes from sheep. Merging these two instances would not accurately represent their
  unique characteristics and properties.
