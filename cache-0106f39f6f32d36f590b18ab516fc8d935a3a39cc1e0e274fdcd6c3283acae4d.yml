text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both 'Soft Water' and 'Water' are related, they refer to different types of water
  with distinct characteristics. Soft water has low mineral content, especially calcium
  and magnesium, while water in general refers to any liquid that is H2O, including
  hard water, which has a higher mineral content. Merging them would lead to a loss
  of specificity and clarity in the classification system.
