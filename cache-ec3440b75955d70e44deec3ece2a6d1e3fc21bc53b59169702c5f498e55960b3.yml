text: No, Pumpkin Seed Oil and Safflower Oil should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have different
  nutritional profiles, flavor profiles, and uses. Merging them would result in a
  loss of specific information and limit the ability to provide accurate dietary advice.
