  While both are types of butter, they have distinct differences in their composition
  and nutritional content. Plant-based butter is made from plant oils and is suitable
  for vegans, whereas unsalted butter is made from animal milk and contains no added
  salt. These differences make them distinct entities in a dietary context.
