  While both Guinea Fowl Gravy and Turkey Gravy are gravies made from poultry, they
  come from different types of poultry (Guinea fowl and turkey, respectively) and
  may have different flavors or ingredients. Therefore, they should be treated as
  separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
