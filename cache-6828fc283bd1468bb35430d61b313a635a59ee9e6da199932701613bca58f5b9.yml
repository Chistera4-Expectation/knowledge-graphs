text: " No. Almond milk and evaporated milk are not semantic and ontological duplicates,\
  \ and they should not be merged together. They belong to different categories of\
  \ food products with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in recipes. Almond milk\
  \ is a plant-based milk alternative made from almonds and water, while evaporated\
  \ milk is a concentrated form of cow\u2019s milk that has been heated to remove\
  \ some of its water content. As such, they have unique properties, benefits, and\
  \ applications, making them non-duplicative within the context of a milk classification\
  \ system."
