text: No, 'Orange juice' and 'Peach juice' should not be merged as they are distinct
  types of juices made from different fruits. While they share some similarities as
  fruit juices, they have unique flavors, nutritional profiles, and characteristics.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of juices available and
  could lead to confusion.
