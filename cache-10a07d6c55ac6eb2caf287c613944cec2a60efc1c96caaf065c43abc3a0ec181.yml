text: 'No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both instances are related to ostrich meat, they represent different forms
  of the same food: ''Ostrich Patties'' refers to ground ostrich meat formed into
  patties, while ''Ostrich'' refers to the whole meat itself. They are not duplicates,
  but rather different types of poultry-derived food.'
