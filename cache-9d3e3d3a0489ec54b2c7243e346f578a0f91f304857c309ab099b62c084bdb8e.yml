  While both Blueberry Honey and Honey are types of honey, they have distinct characteristics
  that make them different from one another. Blueberry Honey is a varietal honey made
  primarily from the nectar of blueberry flowers, while Honey can refer to any sweet
  substance produced by bees from the nectar of flowers. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge these two concepts as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
