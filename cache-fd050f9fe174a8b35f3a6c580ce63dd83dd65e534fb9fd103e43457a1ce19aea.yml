text: No, Basmati Rice and Parboiled Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different types of rice with distinct characteristics,
  processing methods, and uses. Basmati Rice is a long-grain rice with a nutty flavor
  and aroma, while Parboiled Rice is partially boiled in the husk before being processed.
  These differences make them unique and should be kept separate in a classification
  system.
