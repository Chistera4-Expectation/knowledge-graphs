  While fenugreek seeds and poppy seeds have some similarities (for example, they
  are both small, dried seeds that can be used as ingredients in cooking), they belong
  to different plant species and possess distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, textures,
  and uses in food preparation and traditional medicine. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
