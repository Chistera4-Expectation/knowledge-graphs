text: As a dietician, I can provide insights from a nutritional perspective, but the
  decision on merging instances in a specific classification system is more related
  to semantics and ontology. In this case, 'Savory Yogurt' and 'Yogurt' are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates, as 'Savory Yogurt' refers to a specific type of yogurt
  that has a savory taste, while 'Yogurt' refers to the broader category of fermented
  dairy products. They are related but not the same, and merging them would not accurately
  reflect the differences in their taste and preparation.
