  The two instances, "Arborio rice" and "Rice paper wrappers," are not duplicate entries.
  They refer to different products with distinct purposes and properties, even though
  they both contain the word "rice." Arborio rice is a type of grain used in cooking
  risotto, while rice paper wrappers are thin sheets made from rice flour used for
  wrapping foods like spring rolls. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate.'
