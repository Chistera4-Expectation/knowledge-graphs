  While Basmati rice and Idli rice may both fall under the category of "rice," they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct properties
  and uses. Basmati rice is a type of long-grain rice that is known for its aroma
  and nutty flavor, while Idli rice (also known as parboiled rice) is a type of short-grain
  rice that has been partially cooked and dried before being ground into flour for
  making idlis, a type of savory steamed cake from South India. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
