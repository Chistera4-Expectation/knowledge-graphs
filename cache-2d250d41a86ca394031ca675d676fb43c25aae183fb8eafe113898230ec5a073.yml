text: No, the instances 'Ghost Shrimp' and 'Mantis Shrimp' should not be merged together.
  Although they are both classified as edible crustaceans, they are different species
  with distinct characteristics, appearances, and habitats. Ghost Shrimp belong to
  the Palaemonidae family, while Mantis Shrimp belong to the Stomatopoda order. Merging
  them would result in a loss of accurate classification and information about these
  distinct species.
