  While both "Herb butter" and "Unsalted butter" are types of butter, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their ingredients and nutritional content. Herb butter contains
  added herbs for flavor, while unsalted butter has little to no salt content. These
  differences make them unique instances within the Butter class, rather than duplicates.'
