text: ' No. Although "fried chicken" and "grilled chicken" are both types of poultry-derived
  food, they have different preparation methods and nutritional profiles, making them
  distinct from one another. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
