text: ' No. Cream cheese and shredded mozzarella cheese are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, as they have different nutritional profiles, textures, flavors, and
  uses in recipes. While both fall under the broader category of "cheese," they are
  distinct types with unique characteristics that warrant separate classification.'
