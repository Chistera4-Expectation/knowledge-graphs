text: No, King Oyster Mushroom and Porcini Mushroom should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the Edible Mushrooms
  class, they are distinct species with different characteristics, nutritional profiles,
  and culinary uses. King Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus eryngii) is known for its thick,
  meaty texture, while Porcini Mushroom (Boletus edulis) has a nutty, earthy flavor
  and is highly prized in Italian cuisine. Merging them as duplicates would disregard
  these important differences.
