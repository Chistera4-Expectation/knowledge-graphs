  While ground beef and lean beef are both types of beef, they have different properties
  and uses, so it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Ground beef is made by grinding up chunks of beef, and can contain varying
  amounts of fat depending on how it is labeled (e.g., "80% lean"). Lean beef, on
  the other hand, refers specifically to cuts of beef that have a lower fat content
  than regular beef. Therefore, these two terms refer to distinct concepts within
  the domain of beef and should not be merged.'
