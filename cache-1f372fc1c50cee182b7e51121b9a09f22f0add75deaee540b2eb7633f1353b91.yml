text: No, the instances 'Horseshoe Crab' and 'Snow Crab' should not be merged together.
  While both are crustaceans, they belong to different orders and are not semantically
  or ontologically duplicates. Horseshoe Crabs belong to the order Xiphosura, while
  Snow Crabs belong to the order Decapoda. Additionally, Horseshoe Crabs are not typically
  considered edible, whereas Snow Crabs are a popular seafood choice.
