  Although both are derived from poultry, duck patties and duck sausages have distinct
  differences in their preparation and presentation. Duck patties are typically made
  by forming ground duck meat into flat, round shapes, while duck sausages involve
  encasing the ground meat in a casing. These differences make them distinct instances
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.
