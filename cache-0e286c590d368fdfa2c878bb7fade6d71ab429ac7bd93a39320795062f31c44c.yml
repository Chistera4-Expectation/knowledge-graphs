text: ' No. Nectarines and fresh tamarind are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together as they have distinct characteristics, flavors,
  textures, and uses in culinary applications. They belong to different botanical
  families and genera, with nectarines being part of the Rosaceae family (Prunus persica)
  and fresh tamarind belonging to the Fabaceae family (Tamarindus indica).'
