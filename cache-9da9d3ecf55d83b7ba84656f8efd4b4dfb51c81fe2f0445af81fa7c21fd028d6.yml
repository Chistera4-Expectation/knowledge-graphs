text: ' "Yogurt" would be the most adequate choice among Butter, Cheese, Milk, and
  Yogurt as it is typically lower in calories and fat than the other options. Additionally,
  yogurt can provide probiotics which are beneficial for gut health. However, it''s
  important to note that not all yogurts are created equal, and some may contain high
  amounts of added sugars. It is always recommended to check nutrition labels when
  choosing yogurt or any food product.'
