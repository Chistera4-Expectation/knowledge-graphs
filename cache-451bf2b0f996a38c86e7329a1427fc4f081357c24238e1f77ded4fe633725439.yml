text: No, they should not be merged together. While they are both types of drinking
  water, they have distinct characteristics. Spring-fed water specifically refers
  to water that comes from an underground formation where water naturally flows to
  the surface, while the term 'Water' is more general and can encompass a variety
  of water sources, including spring-fed water, but also other types like tap water,
  bottled water, or well water. Merging them would lose the specificity and nuance
  of each type.
