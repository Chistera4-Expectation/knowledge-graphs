  While chili peppers and habanero peppers are both types of pepper and share some
  similarities, they have distinct differences that make them separate entities from
  an ontological perspective. Habanero peppers are a specific variety of chili pepper
  known for their unique flavor profile and high heat level. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
