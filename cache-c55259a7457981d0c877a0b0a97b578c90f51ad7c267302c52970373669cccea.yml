  While flaxseed oil and soybean oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, culinary uses,
  and production methods. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as
  semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Flaxseed oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA),
  while soybean oil contains higher amounts of omega-6 fatty acids. Flaxseed oil has
  a lower smoke point than soybean oil, making it less suitable for cooking at high
  temperatures. Additionally, flaxseed oil is often used for its health benefits,
  whereas soybean oil is more commonly used for frying, baking, and salad dressings
  due to its mild flavor and stability under heat. These distinctions make it important
  to maintain separate categories for these two oils.'
