text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are types of tea, they have distinct differences in terms of flavor, preparation,
  and cultural significance. Black Tea is typically a stronger, more robust tea, while
  Chai Tea is a spiced tea with milk, popular in India and other parts of the world.
  While they are both types of tea, they are not semantically or ontologically equivalent.
