text: ' No. Coconut oil and flaxseed oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils. They have
  different nutritional profiles, sources, uses, and health effects, so it is important
  to distinguish between them. Merging these two concepts would lead to loss of valuable
  information about their unique properties.'
