text: No, the instances 'Lion's Mane Mushroom' and 'Oyster Mushroom' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with unique nutritional and culinary properties. Lion's
  Mane Mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) is known for its potential health benefits, including
  neuroprotective properties, while Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) is a popular
  choice for its versatility and mild flavor. Merging these two instances would not
  accurately represent their individual characteristics and uses.
