text: ' No. Game meats and thinly sliced meat are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They refer to different types of poultry-derived
  food with distinct characteristics. Game meats typically refer to meat from wild
  animals that are hunted for food, while thinly sliced meat can refer to any type
  of meat that has been cut into thin slices. Therefore, they belong to separate categories
  within the poultry-derived food class.'
