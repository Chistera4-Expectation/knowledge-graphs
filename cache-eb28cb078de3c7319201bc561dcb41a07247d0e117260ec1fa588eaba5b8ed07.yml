text: No, 'Chai Tea' and 'Infused Tea' should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of tea, they have different
  properties, ingredients, and preparation methods. Chai tea typically includes black
  tea, milk, and a mix of spices, while infused tea can refer to a wide variety of
  teas infused with different flavors and ingredients. Therefore, they are not duplicates
  and should be considered distinct entities.
