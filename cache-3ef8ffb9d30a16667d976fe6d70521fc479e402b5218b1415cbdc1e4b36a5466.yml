  While both Pecorino Romano and Shredded Mozzarella are types of cheese, they have
  distinct characteristics that make them unique and not semantic nor ontological
  duplicates. Pecorino Romano is a hard Italian cheese made from sheep''s milk with
  a strong flavor, typically used for grating. On the other hand, Shredded Mozzarella
  is a semi-soft Italian cheese made from cow''s milk, often used for melting on top
  of dishes like pizza and lasagna. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two cheeses as duplicates.'
