text: No, Pork Belly and Pork Cutlet should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they are both derived from pork, they represent different
  cuts of meat and have distinct culinary applications. Pork Belly is a fatty cut
  of meat often used for slow-cooking, while Pork Cutlet is a leaner cut typically
  used for pan-frying or breading and frying. Merging them would not accurately represent
  their unique characteristics and uses.
