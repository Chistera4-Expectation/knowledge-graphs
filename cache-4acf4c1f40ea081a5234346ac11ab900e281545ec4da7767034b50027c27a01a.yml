text: ' The most adequate class for "Cheese" among the given options would be simply
  "Cheese". This is because "Cheese" is the food item that is most closely related
  to the other options in terms of their category. Butter, Milk, and Yogurt are all
  dairy products like Cheese, but they have distinct characteristics and uses compared
  to Cheese. Therefore, using the term "Cheese" as the class name provides the most
  specific and accurate representation of the group being defined.'
