text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of vinegar, they
  have different properties and uses in cooking. Balsamic vinegar is typically sweeter
  and thicker, while white vinegar is more acidic and commonly used for pickling and
  cleaning. Merging them would not accurately represent their distinct characteristics.
