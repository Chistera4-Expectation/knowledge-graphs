  The two instances, "Cumin seeds" and "Chia seeds for added crunch," are not identical
  in their meaning and purpose. Cumin seeds are commonly used as a spice to add flavor
  to dishes, while chia seeds are often used as a nutritious addition to foods for
  their high fiber and omega-3 fatty acid content. The fact that they both can provide
  a crunchy texture does not make them interchangeable or duplicate options. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate.'
