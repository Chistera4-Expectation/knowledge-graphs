text: No, Flying fish and Swordfish should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they both belong to the Edible Fish class, they
  are distinct species with different characteristics, habitats, and nutritional profiles.
  Merging them would lead to inaccuracies and confusion.
