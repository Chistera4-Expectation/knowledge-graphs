  Hemp seeds and kiwi seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come
  from different plants (hemp vs kiwifruit), have distinct nutritional profiles, and
  serve various culinary purposes. While both can provide health benefits, they cannot
  be considered identical due to their unique properties and origins. Therefore, it
  is appropriate for them to remain separate instances within the context of an edible
  seed classification system.'
