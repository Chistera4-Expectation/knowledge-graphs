text: As a dietician, my focus is on nutrition and health, not on the semantics or
  ontology of tea classes. However, from a classification standpoint, 'Darjeeling
  Tea' and 'Mint Tea' are different types of tea with distinct flavors and origins.
  Therefore, I would not consider them to be semantic or ontologic duplicates and
  would not recommend merging them.
