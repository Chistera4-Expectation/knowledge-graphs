text: No, Cooking oil and Peanut oil should not be merged together as they are not
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Cooking oil is a general term referring to various
  types of oils used for cooking purposes, while Peanut oil is a specific type of
  oil extracted from peanuts. Although Peanut oil can be considered as a type of cooking
  oil, they are not the same and should be treated as separate instances.
