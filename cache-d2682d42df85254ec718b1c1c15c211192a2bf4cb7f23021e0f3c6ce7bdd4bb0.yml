text: ' No. Cherry Blossom Honey is a specific type of honey that has its own unique
  characteristics and flavor profile, which differs from other types of honey such
  as clover honey or wildflower honey. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  the instance "Cherry Blossom Honey" with the more general instance "Honey." Instead,
  they should both exist as separate but related concepts within a knowledge graph
  or database.'
