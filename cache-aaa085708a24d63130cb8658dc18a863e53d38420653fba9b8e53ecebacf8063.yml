  While rice bran oil and sunflower oil may share some similarities as types of edible
  vegetable oils, they have distinct chemical compositions, nutritional profiles,
  and production processes that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
