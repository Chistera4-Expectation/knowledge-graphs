  Although both are types of drinking water, they have distinct differences. Artisanal
  water typically refers to water sourced from natural springs and bottled, while
  boiling water is water that has been heated to a high temperature to eliminate contaminants
  and pathogens. These two types of drinking water serve different purposes and are
  not interchangeable.
