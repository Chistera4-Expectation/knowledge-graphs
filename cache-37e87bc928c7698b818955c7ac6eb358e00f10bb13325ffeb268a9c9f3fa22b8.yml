text: ' "Edible Foods" would be the most adequate class to group all the items you
  listed, as they are all types of food or drink that can be consumed. However, if
  you want a more specific category for "Toppings of your choice," then "Food Toppings"
  could work, which would include options such as Cheese, Sauce, Spice, Food Seasoning,
  and Food Dressing.'
