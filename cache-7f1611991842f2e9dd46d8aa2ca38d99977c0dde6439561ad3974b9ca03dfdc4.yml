text: ' "Cheese" would be the most adequate class for Fresh Mozzarella Cheese. This
  is because fresh mozzarella cheese shares many common characteristics with other
  types of cheeses, such as being made from milk and having a distinctive flavor and
  texture. Additionally, it undergoes similar processes during production, such as
  fermentation and curdling, which are unique to dairy products like cheese. Therefore,
  placing fresh mozzarella in the "Cheese" category allows for better organization
  and differentiation between various food items.'
