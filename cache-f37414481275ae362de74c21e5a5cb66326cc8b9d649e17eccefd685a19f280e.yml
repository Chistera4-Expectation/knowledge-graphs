text: No, the instances 'Drinkable Yogurt' and 'Lassi Yogurt' should not be merged
  as they are not exactly the same. While both are liquid yogurt products, they have
  distinct characteristics and preparation methods. Drinkable yogurt is usually a
  strained or thickened yogurt with added flavors and sweeteners, while lassi is a
  traditional Indian yogurt-based beverage that can be sweet or savory, and is often
  flavored with spices or fruits. Merging these two would not accurately represent
  their differences.
