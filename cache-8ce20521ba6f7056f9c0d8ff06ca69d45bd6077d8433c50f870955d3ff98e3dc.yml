text: No, the instances 'Ostrich Tenders' and 'Pheasant Tenders' should not be merged
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they both fall under the Poultry-derived
  Food class, they are different types of poultry and should be treated as separate
  instances. They may have some similarities, but they also have distinct characteristics,
  nutritional profiles, and possibly different uses in culinary applications.
