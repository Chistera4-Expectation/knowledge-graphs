text: No, Mineral Water and Tap Water should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they both fall under the broader category of drinking
  water, they have distinct characteristics and properties. Mineral Water contains
  naturally occurring minerals and can come from springs or boreholes, while Tap Water
  is treated and supplied by a public water system. Merging them would not accurately
  represent their differences in composition and usage.
