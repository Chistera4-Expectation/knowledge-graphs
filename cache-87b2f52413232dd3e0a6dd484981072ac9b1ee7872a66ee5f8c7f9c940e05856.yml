text: No, Arborio Rice and Rice Rolls should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are related to rice, they are distinct types of
  rice products with different uses and nutritional profiles. Arborio Rice is a short-grain
  Italian rice used for risotto, while Rice Rolls are a dish made from cooked rice
  wrapped in a sheet of nori (seaweed) and typically filled with various ingredients.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
