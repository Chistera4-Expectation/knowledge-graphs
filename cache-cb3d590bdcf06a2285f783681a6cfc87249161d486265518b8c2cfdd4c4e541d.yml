text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are derived from poultry and contain similar ingredients, they are not the same.
  'Duck Stock' is specifically made from duck bones and/or meat, whereas 'Chicken/Vegetable
  Stock' is made from chicken bones/meat and vegetables. They have distinct flavor
  profiles and nutritional compositions.
