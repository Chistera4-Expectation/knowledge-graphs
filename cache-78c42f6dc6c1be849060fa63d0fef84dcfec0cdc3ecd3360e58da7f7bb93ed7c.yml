text: No, Japonica Rice and Long-grain Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics and
  uses. Japonica Rice is a short-grain rice with a high starch content, resulting
  in a sticky texture when cooked. It is commonly used in dishes like sushi and risotto.
  Long-grain Rice, on the other hand, has a lower starch content and remains separate
  and fluffy when cooked, making it suitable for dishes like pilaf and biryani. These
  differences in properties and uses make them distinct types of rice and not semantic
  or ontological duplicates.
