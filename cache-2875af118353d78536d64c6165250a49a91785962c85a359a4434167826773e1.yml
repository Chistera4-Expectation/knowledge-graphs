  While both "chicken" and "low-sodium chicken broth" are related to poultry, they
  cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they represent
  different food items with distinct nutritional profiles. Chicken is a type of meat
  from chickens, while low-sodium chicken broth is an ingredient made by simmering
  chicken along with vegetables and seasonings (such as herbs and spices) and then
  removing the solid components; it has reduced sodium content compared to regular
  chicken broth. Merging them would not accurately reflect their differences in meaning
  and usage.'
