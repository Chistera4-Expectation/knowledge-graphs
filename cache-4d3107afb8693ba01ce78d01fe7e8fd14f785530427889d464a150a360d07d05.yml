text: No, chili powder and chili paste should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are distinct seasonings with different textures, flavors,
  and uses in cooking. Chili powder typically refers to a blend of ground chili peppers
  and other spices, while chili paste is a concentrated, often spicy, paste made from
  chili peppers and other ingredients. They are not interchangeable in recipes and
  serve different purposes in cooking.
