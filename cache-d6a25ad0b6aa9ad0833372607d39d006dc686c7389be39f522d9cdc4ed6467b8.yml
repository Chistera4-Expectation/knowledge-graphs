  While both barbecue sauce and tomato sauce may contain similar ingredients (such
  as tomatoes), they have different purposes and flavors. Barbecue sauce is typically
  used as a marinade, glaze, or condiment for grilled meats and often contains additional
  flavorings such as sugar, vinegar, mustard, or spices. Tomato sauce, on the other
  hand, is a basic culinary preparation made primarily from cooked tomatoes that can
  serve as a base ingredient for various dishes like pasta sauces, stews, soups, and
  casseroles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.'
