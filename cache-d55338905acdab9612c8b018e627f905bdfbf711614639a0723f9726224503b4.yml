text: No, the instances 'Maitake Mushroom' and 'Velvet Pioppini Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both edible
  mushrooms, they are different species with distinct characteristics and properties.
  Maitake mushrooms (Grifola frondosa) are known for their fan-like shape and rich,
  earthy flavor, while Velvet Pioppini mushrooms (Agrocybe aegerita) have a velvety
  texture and a mild, nutty taste. Merging them would not accurately represent their
  unique qualities and uses.
