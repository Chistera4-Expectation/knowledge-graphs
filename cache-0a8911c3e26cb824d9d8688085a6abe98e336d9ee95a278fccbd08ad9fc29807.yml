  While chicken breasts and chicken tacos are both poultry-derived foods, they cannot
  be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer to different
  culinary preparations with distinct nutritional profiles. Chicken breasts primarily
  consist of the breast meat from chickens, while chicken tacos are a dish made using
  chicken breasts (or sometimes other cuts) along with various ingredients like tortillas,
  salsa, cheese, etc., which significantly alter their overall composition and properties.'
