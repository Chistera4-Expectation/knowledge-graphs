text: ' "Dairy Fat" or simply "ButterFat" could be suitable class names for the category
  that includes butter. This is because all of these foods (butter, cheese, milk,
  and yogurt) contain significant amounts of fat, with butter being the richest source
  in this group. However, it''s essential to note that each food offers unique nutritional
  profiles beyond just their fat content.'
