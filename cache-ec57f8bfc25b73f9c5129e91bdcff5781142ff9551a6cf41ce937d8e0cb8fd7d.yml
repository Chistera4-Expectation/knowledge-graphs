text: ' No. Avocado Dressing and Poppy Seed Dressing are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, as they have distinct ingredients, flavors, textures, and uses. While
  both can be used as toppings for salads, they serve different purposes in terms
  of taste and nutrition. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate
  food categories.'
