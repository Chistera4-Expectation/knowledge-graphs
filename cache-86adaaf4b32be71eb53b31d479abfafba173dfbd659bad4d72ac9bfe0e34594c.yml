  While both Chicken Parmesan and Rotisserie Chicken are poultry-derived foods, they
  cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they represent
  different types of dishes with distinct preparation methods and ingredients.


  Chicken Parmesan is an Italian-American dish that typically consists of breaded
  and pan-fried chicken topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and often served
  over pasta. It involves several steps for preparing and cooking the meal.


  On the other hand, Rotisserie Chicken refers to a whole chicken cooked on a rotating
  spit in an oven or specialized machine. The cooking process slowly turns the bird
  while it cooks evenly, producing tender and juicy meat. There are minimal added
  ingredients involved, usually just salt, pepper, and sometimes herbs for seasoning.


  Since these two food items have unique preparation processes and serve various culinary
  purposes, there is no basis for merging them into semantic and ontological duplicates.'
