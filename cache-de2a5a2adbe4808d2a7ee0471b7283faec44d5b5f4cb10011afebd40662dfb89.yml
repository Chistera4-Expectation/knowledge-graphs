text: No, 'Chicken Breast' and 'Chicken Gravy' should not be merged as they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional compositions and uses in recipes. Chicken
  Breast is a lean, low-fat cut of meat, while Chicken Gravy is a sauce made from
  the drippings of cooked chicken and often thickened with a starch.
