text: No, 'Guinea Fowl Gizzards' and 'Quail Gizzards' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the Poultry-derived
  Food class and are gizzards, they come from different bird species and have distinct
  nutritional profiles. Therefore, they should be treated as separate entities in
  a dietician's classification.
