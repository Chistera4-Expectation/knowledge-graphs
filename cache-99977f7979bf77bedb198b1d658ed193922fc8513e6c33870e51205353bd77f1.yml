text: ' Sauce would be the most adequate class for bulking agents. Bulking agents
  are typically added to foods to increase their volume and bulk, without adding significant
  amounts of calories or nutrients. Examples of bulking agents include xanthan gum,
  guar gum, and locust bean gum, which are often used in sauces as thickening agents
  to improve texture and consistency. Other classes like food dressing, seasoning,
  spices, and sweeteners may contain bulking agents but they primarily serve different
  functions such as flavor enhancement or sugar replacement.'
