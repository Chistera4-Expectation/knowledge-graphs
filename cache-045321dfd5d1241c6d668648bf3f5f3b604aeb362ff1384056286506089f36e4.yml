text: ' No. While both carbohydrates and fiber are types of nutrients found in food,
  they serve different purposes in our diet and have distinct health benefits. Carbohydrates
  provide energy for the body, while fiber promotes digestive health and helps regulate
  blood sugar levels. Therefore, it is important to track each separately when considering
  nutrition information for cheese or any other food item.'
