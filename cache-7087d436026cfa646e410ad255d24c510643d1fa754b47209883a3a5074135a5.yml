text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both Hedgehog Mushrooms (Hydnum repandum) and Porcini Mushrooms (Boletus edulis)
  are edible mushrooms, they are distinct species with different characteristics and
  properties. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique identities
  and roles in the Edible Mushrooms class.
