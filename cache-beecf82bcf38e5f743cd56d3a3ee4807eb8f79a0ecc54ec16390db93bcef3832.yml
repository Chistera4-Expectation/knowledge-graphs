text: 'As a dietician, I can provide some information on this matter, but the final
  decision would depend on the specific context and classification system being used.


  Both noodles and shirataki noodles are types of pasta. Noodles typically refer to
  a wide range of pasta, while shirataki noodles are specifically made from the konjac
  yam and are lower in calories. They can be considered as subcategories within the
  broader pasta category.


  In some classification systems, it may be appropriate to merge these two instances
  as semantic and ontological duplicates since they both fall under the pasta category.
  However, in other systems, it may be more useful to keep them separate to highlight
  the specific characteristics of shirataki noodles, such as their lower calorie content
  and unique ingredients.


  In conclusion, whether to merge or not would depend on the specific context and
  classification system being used.'
