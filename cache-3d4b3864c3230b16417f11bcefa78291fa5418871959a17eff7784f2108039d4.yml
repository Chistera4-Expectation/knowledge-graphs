text: No, Earl Grey Tea and Infused Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although both are types of tea, they differ in their ingredients and
  flavor profiles. Earl Grey Tea is typically black tea infused with bergamot oil,
  while Infused Tea refers to tea that has been steeped with various herbs, fruits,
  or spices to enhance its flavor. They are distinct types of tea and should be considered
  separate entities.
