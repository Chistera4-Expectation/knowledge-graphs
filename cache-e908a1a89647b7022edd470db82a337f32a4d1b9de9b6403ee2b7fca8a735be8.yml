text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from turkey, they are different cuts of meat with distinct nutritional
  values and cooking properties. Turkey drumsticks are dark meat and have a higher
  fat content, while turkey patties are typically made from ground turkey breast,
  which is leaner and has less fat. Merging them would lead to a loss of specificity
  and accuracy in the classification of these food items.
