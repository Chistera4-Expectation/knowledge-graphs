text: No, 'Alkaline Water' and 'Mineral Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both types of water are related, they have distinct
  differences in composition and properties. Alkaline Water has a higher pH level
  than regular water, while Mineral Water contains various minerals and trace elements.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between the two types
  of water.
