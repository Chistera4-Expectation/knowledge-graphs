text: ' "Sweetener" would be the most appropriate category for categorizing different
  types of sweeteners. This is because it specifically refers to substances that are
  used to add sweetness to foods and drinks, which aligns with what sweeteners are
  primarily used for. The other categories such as food dressing, seasoning, sauce,
  and spices have broader definitions and encompass various functions beyond adding
  sweetness.'
