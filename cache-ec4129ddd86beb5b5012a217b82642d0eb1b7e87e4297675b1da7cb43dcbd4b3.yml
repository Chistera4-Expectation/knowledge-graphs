text: ' No. While both "Coffee" and "roast" are related to coffee, they represent
  different concepts. "Coffee" refers to the drink itself, while "roast" refers to
  the degree to which coffee beans have been heated during processing, affecting their
  flavor profile. Merging them would not accurately reflect these distinct meanings.'
