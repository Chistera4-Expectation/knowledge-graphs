text: As a dietician, my answer is no. Although both 'Juice' and 'Key lime juice'
  are types of juice, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. 'Juice' is
  a more general term that encompasses various fruit and vegetable juices, while 'Key
  lime juice' is a specific type of juice derived from Key limes. They have different
  nutritional compositions, flavors, and applications in recipes or dietary recommendations.
