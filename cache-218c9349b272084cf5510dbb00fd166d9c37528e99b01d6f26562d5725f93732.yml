text: ' No. While both fresh fish and salted fish are types of edible fish, they have
  different properties and uses, so they should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Fresh fish is unprocessed and perishable, while salted fish has been
  preserved through the addition of salt and can be stored for longer periods of time.
  These differences in characteristics and usage mean that they should be treated
  as separate entities within the edible fish class.'
