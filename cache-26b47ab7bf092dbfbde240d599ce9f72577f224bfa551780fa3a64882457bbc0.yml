text: No, Lactose-free Butter and Salted Butter should not be merged together as they
  serve different purposes and have different nutritional properties. Lactose-free
  Butter is specifically for individuals who cannot tolerate lactose, while Salted
  Butter is simply regular butter with added salt for flavor. These are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates.
