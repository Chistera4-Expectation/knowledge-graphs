  While both "optional seasonings" and "seasoning cubes" may refer to adding flavor
  to food, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Optional seasonings can
  include a wide variety of individual spices, herbs, salts, peppers, and other ingredients
  that are added according to personal preference, while seasoning cubes (such as
  bouillon cubes) are pre-measured and often contain multiple ingredients combined
  into one concentrated cube for convenience. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep
  them separate categories within the context of a Food Seasoning class.'
