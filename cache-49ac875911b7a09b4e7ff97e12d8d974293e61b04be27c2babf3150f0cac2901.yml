text: As a dietician, I would recommend that 'A2 Butter' and 'Clarified Butter' should
  not be merged together as they have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional
  content and production process. A2 Butter is made from milk containing A2 beta-casein
  protein, while Clarified Butter is a type of butter that has been heated to remove
  milk solids and water, resulting in a concentrated butterfat. Although they are
  both types of butter, they have unique characteristics and purposes.
