  While both "Optional dipping sauce" and "Piri piri sauce" may involve similar concepts
  related to sauces used for flavoring food, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. "Optional dipping sauce" is a general term that can refer to any type
  of sauce intended for dipping, while "Piri piri sauce" refers specifically to a
  spicy sauce made with African bird''s eye chili peppers (also known as Piri Piri)
  and other ingredients such as citrus, garlic, onion, paprika, salt, oil, and vinegar.
  Therefore, these two terms have different meanings and serve distinct purposes within
  their respective contexts.'
