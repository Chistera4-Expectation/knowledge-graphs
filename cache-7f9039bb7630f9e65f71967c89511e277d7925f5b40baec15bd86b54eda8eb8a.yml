  Honey is a type of natural sweetener, but it is not the same thing as all sweeteners.
  The category of "sweeteners" includes both natural options like honey and maple
  syrup, as well as artificial or highly processed choices like white sugar, high
  fructose corn syrup, and artificial sweeteners. While there may be some overlap
  between these categories, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they refer to distinct concepts with different properties and uses.'
