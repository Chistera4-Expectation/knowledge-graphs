text: ' No, fresh cilantro leaves and fresh ginger are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They belong to different categories of edible vegetables: herbs (cilantro)
  and rhizomes (ginger). While they share some characteristics such as being used
  for flavoring food, they have distinct tastes, textures, nutritional profiles, and
  growth habits. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entities
  in an edible vegetable classification system.'
