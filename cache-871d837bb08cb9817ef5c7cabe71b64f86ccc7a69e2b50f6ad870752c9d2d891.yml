text: As a dietician, I cannot definitively answer this question without more context
  on the specifics of the Honey class and its intended use. However, if 'Alfalfa Honey'
  and 'Sunflower Honey' are indeed semantic and ontological duplicates, then it would
  be appropriate to merge them. But ultimately, the decision should be based on the
  specific context and purpose of the classification system.
