  While Adobo seasoning and Taco seasoning may have some similar ingredients (such
  as chili powder, garlic powder, and onion powder), they are not semantic nor ontological
  duplicates because they serve different purposes and bring unique flavors to dishes.
  Adobo seasoning is typically used for Filipino cuisine, while taco seasoning is
  commonly used for Mexican dishes such as tacos and fajitas. They each contain distinct
  spices that give them their specific flavor profiles and culinary uses. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances together.'
