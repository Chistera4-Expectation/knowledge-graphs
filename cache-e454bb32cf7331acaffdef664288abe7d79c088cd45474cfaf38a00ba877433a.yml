  While pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds can both be classified under the broader category
  of "edible seeds," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and growth characteristics that make them unique
  from one another. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep these two seed types separate
  when discussing their individual properties and benefits.'
