  Chili paste and adding pepper "to taste" serve different purposes when it comes
  to seasoning food, so they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Chili paste is typically made from ground chilies, vinegar, spices, and sometimes
  other ingredients like garlic or ginger. It has a specific flavor profile and consistency
  that adds heat, tanginess, and depth of flavor to dishes. On the other hand, adding
  pepper "to taste" refers to adjusting the amount of black or white pepper added
  during cooking based on personal preference for its pungent, sharp flavor. These
  two seasonings are not interchangeable because they contribute differently to the
  overall taste, texture, and aroma of a dish. Therefore, they should remain separate
  instances within the context of a Food Seasoning class.'
