text: No, these instances should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct characteristics,
  nutritional profiles, and uses. Sesame oil is known for its nutty aroma and is commonly
  used in Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines, while wheat germ oil is rich in vitamin
  E and is often used in supplements and as a dietary source of the vitamin.
