text: No, Maitake and Morel Mushrooms should not be merged together as they are distinct
  and unique types of edible mushrooms with different nutritional profiles, appearances,
  and flavors. While both are edible and belong to the broader category of edible
  mushrooms, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
