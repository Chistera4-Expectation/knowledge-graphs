  While both "additional seasonings" and "Cajun seasoning" may involve adding flavor
  to food, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. "Additional seasonings"
  is a general term that can refer to any number of spices or flavorings added to
  food, while "Cajun seasoning" refers to a specific blend of herbs and spices commonly
  used in Cajun cuisine. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two
  instances together.'
