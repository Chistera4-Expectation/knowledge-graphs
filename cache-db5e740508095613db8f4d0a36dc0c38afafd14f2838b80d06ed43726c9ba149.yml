  While both Greek Yogurt Dressing and Poppy Seed Dressing may fall under the broader
  category of "Salad Dressings," they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates.
  Semantically, they have different ingredients and flavors - one is based on Greek
  yogurt while the other contains poppy seeds. Ontologically, they represent distinct
  entities with unique properties and uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as duplicates.'
