text: No, Low-Fat Yogurt and Savory Yogurt should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of yogurt based on their fat content
  and flavor profiles. Low-fat yogurt refers to yogurt with reduced fat content, while
  savory yogurt refers to yogurt with a savory flavor, which can be low-fat or full-fat.
