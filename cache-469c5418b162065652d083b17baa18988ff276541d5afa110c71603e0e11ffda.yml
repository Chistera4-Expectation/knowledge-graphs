  Both "Maggi seasoning cubes" and "seasoning cubes" generally refer to the same type
  of product: small blocks of concentrated flavoring agents used to add taste to various
  dishes during cooking. Maggi is actually just one brand that produces these types
  of seasoning cubes, which may also be manufactured by other companies under different
  names. Therefore, it would make sense to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates since they share similar meanings and functions within this context.'
