text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of food products
  derived from ostrich meat. Ostrich patties are typically made by forming ground
  ostrich meat into patties, while ostrich soup is a liquid dish made with ostrich
  meat and other ingredients. Although they both come from the same source, they are
  distinct food items.
