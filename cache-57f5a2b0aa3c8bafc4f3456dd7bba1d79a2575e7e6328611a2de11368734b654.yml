  The instances "Ground beef" and "Thinly sliced beef" are not identical in terms
  of their texture, consistency, and usage in cooking, despite being made from the
  same animal source (beef). Ground beef is typically used for dishes like burgers,
  meatballs, and spaghetti sauce, while thinly sliced beef is often used for dishes
  like stir-fries, sandwiches, and salads. Therefore, they can be considered as two
  different entities with distinct characteristics, and it''s appropriate to keep
  them separate rather than merging them as duplicates.'
