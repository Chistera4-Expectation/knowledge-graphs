  While both bulking agents and dipping sauces can serve similar functions in terms
  of adding volume to food or enhancing flavor, they are distinct concepts with different
  uses and properties. Bulking agents refer to substances added to food products to
  increase their bulk or volume without significantly altering the taste, texture,
  or nutritional content. Examples include cellulose, maltodextrin, and guar gum.
  Dipping sauces, on the other hand, are condiments intended for dipping foods into,
  often served alongside dishes like fried chicken, French fries, or breadsticks.
  They typically have strong flavors and may contain ingredients such as herbs, spices,
  vinegar, oil, sugar, or salt. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two classes as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
