text: No, "Ostrich Broth" and "Ostrich Eggs" should not be merged together as they
  are different types of poultry-derived food items. Ostrich Broth is a liquid derived
  from cooking ostrich meat or bones, while Ostrich Eggs are the eggs laid by ostriches.
  These items serve different purposes in cooking and have distinct nutritional profiles.
