text: No, Earl Grey Tea and Pu-erh Tea should not be merged together as they are different
  types of tea with distinct characteristics and properties. While both are classified
  as tea, they have unique flavors, brewing methods, and potential health benefits.
  Merging them would not accurately represent their differences and could lead to
  confusion for users.
