text: No, Hemp Milk and Oat Milk should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although they both belong to the Milk class, they are derived from different sources
  and have different nutritional profiles. Hemp Milk is made from hemp seeds, while
  Oat Milk is made from oats. They have distinct flavors, textures, and nutritional
  benefits, which make them separate entities within the Milk class.
