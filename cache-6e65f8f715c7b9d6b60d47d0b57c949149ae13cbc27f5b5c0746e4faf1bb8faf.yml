text: No, they should not be merged as they have different ingredients, purposes,
  and cultural contexts. Enchilada sauce is typically a tomato-based sauce with chili
  peppers and spices, used in Mexican cuisine, while soy sauce is a fermented liquid
  made from soybeans and roasted grains, used in Asian cuisine. These sauces have
  distinct properties and cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.
