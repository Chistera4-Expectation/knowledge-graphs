  While both "chicken pot pie" and "low-sodium chicken broth" are poultry-derived
  foods, they have different ingredients, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. A chicken pot pie typically contains chicken, vegetables, and a pastry
  crust, while low-sodium chicken broth is primarily made of reduced sodium chicken
  stock without any added thickeners or fillings. These differences warrant that they
  remain separate entities within the food classification system.'
