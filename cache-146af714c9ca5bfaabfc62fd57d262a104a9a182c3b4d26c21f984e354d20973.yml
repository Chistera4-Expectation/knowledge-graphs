  While both chicken nuggets and chicken pieces are made from poultry meat, they differ
  in their preparation and composition. Chicken nuggets typically consist of ground
  or formed chicken meat that has been breaded or battered before being fried or baked.
  On the other hand, chicken pieces usually refer to larger portions of chicken cuts
  such as breasts, thighs, drumsticks, or wings, which may have varying cooking methods
  but do not involve grinding or forming like chicken nuggets. Therefore, it is appropriate
  for them to remain separate instances due to these differences in form and processing.'
