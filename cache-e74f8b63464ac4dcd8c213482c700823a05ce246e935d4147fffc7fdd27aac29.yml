text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both are derived from ostrich, they serve different purposes and have distinct ingredients
  and preparation methods. Ostrich gravy is a sauce typically made with pan drippings,
  flour, and other seasonings, whereas ostrich stock is a liquid base made by simmering
  ostrich bones, vegetables, and seasonings. They are related but not duplicates.
