  While both Pepper and Sichuan peppercorns are types of seasonings used in food,
  they have distinct differences in taste, origin, and usage. Therefore, it is not
  appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. It''s essential
  to maintain their separate identities since they serve different purposes in cooking
  and contribute unique flavors to dishes.'
