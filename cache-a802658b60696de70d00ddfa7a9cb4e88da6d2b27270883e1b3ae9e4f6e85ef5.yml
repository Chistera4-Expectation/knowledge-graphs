  While both "Creamy Garlic Dressing" and "Tahini Dressing" may fall under the broader
  category of "Food Dressings," they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates.
  They have distinct ingredients (cream vs tahini), flavors (garlic vs sesame), textures,
  nutritional profiles, and uses in various dishes. Therefore, it is essential to
  maintain them as separate instances in order to provide accurate information about
  their unique characteristics and applications.'
