text: No, the instances 'Crab' and 'Stone Crab' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the class of edible crustaceans,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, habitats, and culinary
  uses. Therefore, it is essential to maintain separate instances for each species
  to accurately represent their unique attributes.
