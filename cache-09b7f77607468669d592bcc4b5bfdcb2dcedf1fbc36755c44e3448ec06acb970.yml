text: No, Quail Gravy and Quail Nuggets should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct food items made from quail meat, with
  different preparation methods and uses. Quail Gravy is a sauce made from quail meat,
  while Quail Nuggets are bite-sized pieces of quail meat, usually breaded and fried.
  Although they are both derived from quail meat, they are not the same food item.
