text: No, Quail Meat and Quail Sausage should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they both come from the same animal, they are different
  food products with distinct processing methods and nutritional profiles. Quail Meat
  refers to the muscle tissue of the bird, while Quail Sausage is a processed product
  made from ground quail meat, seasonings, and other ingredients.
