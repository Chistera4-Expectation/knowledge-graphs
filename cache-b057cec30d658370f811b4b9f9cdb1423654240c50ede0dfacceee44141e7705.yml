text: ' "Drinking Water" would be the most adequate class for a sports drink. Sports
  drinks are designed to help athletes and physically active individuals replace water,
  electrolytes, and energy lost through sweat during exercise. They typically contain
  carbohydrates, sodium, potassium, and other minerals in varying concentrations.
  While some of the other options you listed can also contribute to hydration, they
  may not provide the same balance of nutrients as a sports drink or may have additional
  ingredients that could negatively impact performance (such as caffeine in coffee
  or alcohol in an alcoholic drink). Drinking water is the simplest and purest form
  of hydration, but sports drinks offer added benefits specifically tailored for physical
  activity.'
