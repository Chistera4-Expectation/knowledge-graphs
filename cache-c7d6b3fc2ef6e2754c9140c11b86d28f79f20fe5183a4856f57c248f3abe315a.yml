text: No, Avocado Oil and Rice Bran Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different nutritional
  profiles and come from different sources. Avocado Oil is derived from the flesh
  of avocados, while Rice Bran Oil comes from the germ and inner husk of rice. These
  differences warrant separate instances in the Edible Vegetal Oil class.
