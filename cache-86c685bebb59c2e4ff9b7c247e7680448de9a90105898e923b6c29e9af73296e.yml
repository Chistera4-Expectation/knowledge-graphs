  Although fresh basil leaves and fresh cilantro share some similarities (both are
  herbs with green leaves), they have distinct flavors, appearances, and uses in cooking.
  Fresh basil has a sweet, pungent flavor and is often used in Italian dishes like
  pesto and caprese salad. On the other hand, fresh cilantro has a strong, citrusy
  taste and is commonly found in Mexican, Asian, and Middle Eastern cuisines. Merging
  these two instances would not accurately represent their unique properties and applications
  within recipes.'
