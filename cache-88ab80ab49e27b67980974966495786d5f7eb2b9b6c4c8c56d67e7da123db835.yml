  While honey is a broad category of sweet substance produced by bees from flower
  nectar, different types of honey (such as sage honey) can have unique properties
  due to differences in the type of flowers visited by the bees for nectar collection.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological
  duplicates.'
