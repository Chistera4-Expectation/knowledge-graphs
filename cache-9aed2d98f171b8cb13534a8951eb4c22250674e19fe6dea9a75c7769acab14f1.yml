text: ' No. While French dressing and olive oil dressing can contain olive oil as
  an ingredient, they are distinct types of dressings with different ingredients and
  flavors. French dressing typically contains vinegar, sugar, and various spices in
  addition to oil, while olive oil dressing is simply olive oil with perhaps some
  herbs or other seasonings added. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic or
  ontological duplicates.'
