text: ' No. Meatballs and "or meat" cannot be considered semantic and ontological
  duplicates in the context of a beef class from a dietitian perspective. Although
  both involve meat, they are not identical entities with the same nutritional values
  and preparation methods. Merging them would lead to confusion and loss of essential
  information regarding food choices for health-conscious individuals.'
