  While both "Ostrich Broth" and "Ostrich" are related to ostrich meat, they are different
  food items with distinct nutritional properties and uses in cooking. Ostrich Broth
  refers to the broth made from ostrich bones and/or meat, while "Ostrich" refers
  to the meat itself, which can be prepared in various ways (e.g., roasted, grilled,
  or stewed).
