text: No, "Duck Patties" and "Duck Thighs" should not be merged as they are distinct
  food items derived from different parts of the duck. Duck Patties are typically
  made from ground duck meat, while Duck Thighs are a specific cut of meat from the
  duck's leg. Although they both fall under the Poultry-derived Food class, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates.
