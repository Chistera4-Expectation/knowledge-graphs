text: No, Green onions and Red onions should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the Allium genus and are considered
  onions, they have distinct characteristics and uses in culinary contexts. Green
  onions, also known as scallions or spring onions, are immature onions with long
  green leaves and a small white bulb, while red onions have a deep red skin and are
  typically larger with a sweeter flavor compared to green onions.
