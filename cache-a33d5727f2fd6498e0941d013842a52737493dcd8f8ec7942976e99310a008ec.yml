  Beans and Green beans are two different vegetables with distinct nutritional profiles,
  culinary uses, and botanical classifications. While they are both legumes, they
  have different flavors, textures, and health benefits. Merging them would not only
  be inaccurate but also lose the unique characteristics of each vegetable.'
