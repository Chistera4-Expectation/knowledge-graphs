  Chicken broth and chicken wings are not semantic or ontological duplicates, as they
  represent different food products with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in
  cooking. Chicken broth is a liquid made by simmering chicken parts (such as bones,
  meat, and vegetables) to extract flavors and nutrients, while chicken wings consist
  of the wing portion of a chicken that can be cooked whole or separated into drumettes
  and flats for various dishes like buffalo wings or grilled wings. Merging them would
  result in an incorrect categorization of these poultry-derived foods.'
