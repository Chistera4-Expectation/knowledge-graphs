  While both Basil and Thai Basil belong to the same family (Lamiaceae) and have similar
  appearances, they are different herbs with distinct flavors, aromas, and uses in
  cooking. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate entities in terms
  of their semantics and ontology within a Food Seasoning class. Merging them would
  result in loss of specific information about each type of basil and its unique characteristics.'
