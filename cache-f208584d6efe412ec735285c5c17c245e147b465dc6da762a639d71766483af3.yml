  Pomegranate seeds (also known as arils) and sesame seeds are distinct types of edible
  seeds that have different nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and growth characteristics.
  Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic or ontological duplicates. Here
  are some key differences between the two:


  1. Botany and Growth: Pomegranate seeds come from the fruit of Punica granatum,
  a deciduous shrub native to Southwest Asia. Sesame seeds come from the plant Sesamum
  indicum, an annual herbaceous plant also native to Southwest Asia. The growth habits,
  cultivation requirements, and harvesting methods for these plants differ significantly.

  2. Nutrition: While both pomegranate seeds and sesame seeds contain various essential
  vitamins and minerals, their specific nutrient compositions vary. For example, pomegranate
  seeds are richer in antioxidants such as polyphenols and anthocyanins, while sesame
  seeds provide more fiber and healthy fats like omega-6 fatty acids. Merging them
  would lead to incorrect or oversimplified information regarding their respective
  health benefits.

  3. Culinary Uses: In terms of cooking applications, pomegranate seeds and sesame
  seeds serve unique purposes. Pomegranate seeds can add crunch, sweetness, and bursts
  of juice to salads, yogurt parfaits, and baked goods, whereas sesame seeds contribute
  nuttiness and texture to dishes like stir-fries, bread, and Asian sauces. Combining
  these categories may create confusion when searching for recipes or usage ideas.

  4. Cultural Significance: Both pomegranate seeds and sesame seeds hold cultural
  importance across various regions worldwide. Merging them could result in losing
  this historical context and significance, which is valuable to understanding their
  role within global cuisines.'
