text: No, coconut oil and sesame oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different chemical
  compositions, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking and other applications.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the distinct characteristics of each
  oil.
