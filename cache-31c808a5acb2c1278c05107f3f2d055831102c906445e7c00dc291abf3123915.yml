text: ' No. Blackberry honey and raw wildflower honey are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They have
  different taste, color, texture, and nutritional profiles due to their distinct
  botanical origins. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between them for accurate
  food labeling and consumer information purposes.'
