text: No, "Duck Soup" and "Duck" should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. "Duck Soup" is a specific dish that contains duck meat, while "Duck"
  is a more general term referring to the bird itself. The distinction between the
  two is important for understanding the specifics of the dish and the broader category
  of poultry-derived food.
