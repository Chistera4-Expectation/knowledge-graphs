text: No, Maltose syrup and Yacon syrup should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both sweeteners, they have different
  chemical compositions, properties, and uses. Maltose syrup is derived from starch,
  primarily from corn or wheat, and is composed of maltose and other sugars. Yacon
  syrup, on the other hand, is derived from the roots of the yacon plant and is composed
  mainly of fructooligosaccharides, which have a lower glycemic index and are considered
  a prebiotic. Therefore, they should be treated as distinct instances within the
  Sweetener class.
