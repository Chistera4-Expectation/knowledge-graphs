  While both "strong coffee" and "the coffee" are related to coffee, they do not refer
  to the same concept and therefore should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.


  "Strong coffee" is a type of coffee that has a higher concentration of coffee grounds
  or a longer brewing time, resulting in a more intense flavor and often containing
  more caffeine than regular coffee. It refers to a specific characteristic or quality
  of coffee.


  On the other hand, "the coffee" is a general term used to refer to any type of coffee
  drink, without specifying its strength, flavor, or preparation method. It can refer
  to weak coffee, strong coffee, black coffee, or coffee with milk and sugar.


  Therefore, while both terms may overlap in some contexts, they have different meanings
  and connotations, making them distinct concepts.'
