  While both Acacia honey and Orange Blossom honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics that make them unique. Acacia honey is known for its mild flavor,
  light color, and high fructose content, while Orange Blossom honey has a more floral
  and fruity taste with a slightly darker color. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two classes as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
