text: No, Coconut water and Infused Water should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are types of water, they have distinct properties and
  uses. Coconut water is a natural beverage derived from coconuts, while Infused Water
  refers to water that has been flavored with various fruits, herbs, or vegetables.
  These differences in composition and purpose make them separate instances in the
  Drinking Water class.
