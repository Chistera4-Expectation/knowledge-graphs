  While both "ginger paste" and "pickled ginger" contain ginger, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they have different culinary uses and preparation
  methods. Ginger paste is typically made from fresh ginger that has been blended
  into a smooth puree with some added oil or water, while pickled ginger (also known
  as gari) involves preserving thin slices of ginger in vinegar, sugar, and sometimes
  other seasonings. Therefore, they represent distinct food items with unique flavor
  profiles and applications in cooking.'
