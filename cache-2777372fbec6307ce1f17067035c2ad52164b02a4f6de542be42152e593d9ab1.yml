  While both "chicken wings" and "grilled chicken" are types of poultry-derived food,
  they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer
  to different cuts of meat that undergo distinct preparation methods. Chicken wings
  typically consist of three sections (drumette, wingette, and tip) with skin on,
  while grilled chicken usually refers to breast, thigh, or tenderloin cooked by direct
  heat. Therefore, their nutritional profiles differ significantly due to variations
  in fat content, cooking method, and serving size.'
