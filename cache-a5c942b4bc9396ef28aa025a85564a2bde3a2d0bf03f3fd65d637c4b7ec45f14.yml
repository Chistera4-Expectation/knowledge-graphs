text: ' "Food Seasoning" or "Dried Vegetable" would be the most appropriate classes
  for Celery Powder. It is often used as a flavor enhancer and seasoning in cooking,
  making it similar to other spices or food seasonings. However, some people also
  use celery powder as a vegetable alternative in certain recipes, so the "Edible
  Vegetable" category could also apply. Ultimately, the best fit depends on how you
  intend to use the celery powder in your specific context.'
