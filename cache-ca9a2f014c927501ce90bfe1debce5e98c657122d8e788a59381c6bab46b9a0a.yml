text: ' No. While both button mushrooms and portobello mushrooms belong to the same
  species (Agaricus bisporus) and share some similarities in appearance and taste,
  they are distinct varieties with different characteristics and uses in cooking.
  Button mushrooms are typically smaller and have a more delicate flavor, while portobello
  mushrooms are larger and have a meatier texture and stronger flavor. They can be
  used interchangeably in some recipes, but they also have unique culinary applications
  that make them worth distinguishing from each other. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
