text: No, they should not be merged together. Ant Larvae and Black Soldier Fly Larvae
  are different species of insects and therefore should be treated as separate entities
  in the Insect-Derived Food class. While they both fall under the broader category
  of insect larvae, they have distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and
  cultural uses that warrant separate treatment.
