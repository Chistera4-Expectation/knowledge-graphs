text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Chicken Drumsticks' and
  'Quail Drumsticks' are poultry-derived food items, they are distinct types of drumsticks
  with different nutritional profiles, tastes, and cooking methods. Merging them would
  not accurately reflect their unique properties and would not be a correct representation
  in a semantic or ontological context.
