text: No, Glutinous Rice and White Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they both belong to the Rice class, they have
  distinct characteristics, nutritional values, and culinary uses. Glutinous Rice
  has a higher starch content and is stickier when cooked, making it suitable for
  desserts and certain Asian dishes. White Rice, on the other hand, has a lower starch
  content and is more commonly used in everyday meals worldwide.
