text: No, they should not be merged together. Non-Dairy Yogurt and Probiotic Yogurt
  are distinct categories with different characteristics. Non-Dairy Yogurt refers
  to yogurt made from non-dairy milk alternatives (such as almond, coconut, or soy
  milk), while Probiotic Yogurt contains live and active cultures that can help maintain
  a healthy gut. These categories can overlap (e.g., a non-dairy yogurt can also be
  probiotic), but they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
