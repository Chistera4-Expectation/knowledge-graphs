  The two instances, "Lemon butter" and "Unsalted butter," are not identical in their
  composition, taste, or purpose, despite being types of butter. Lemon butter contains
  lemon juice or zest, giving it a distinct flavor and aroma, whereas unsalted butter
  is made without salt, making it suitable for those who follow a low-sodium diet
  or prefer less salty foods. They can be used differently in recipes and have different
  nutritional profiles. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
