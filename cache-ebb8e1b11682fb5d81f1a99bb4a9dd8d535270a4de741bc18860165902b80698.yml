text: ' No. Eucalyptus honey and raw wildflower honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged together. They are two distinct types of honey
  with different flavor profiles, source flowers, and potentially varying nutritional
  content. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions between these
  unique honeys.'
