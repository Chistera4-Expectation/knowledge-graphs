  While both dishes contain chicken and are derived from poultry, they have different
  ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. Chicken parmesan is
  typically made with breaded chicken breast topped with tomato sauce and melted cheese,
  while chicken pot pie consists of chicken cooked in a creamy sauce with vegetables
  encased in pastry dough. Merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates would
  not accurately represent their distinct culinary identities.'
