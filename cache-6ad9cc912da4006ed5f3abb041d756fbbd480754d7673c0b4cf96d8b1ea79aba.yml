text: ' "Edible Vegetable" would be the most adequate class for beef broth. Although
  it is made from animal products, in food classification systems it often falls under
  the broader category of vegetables due to its liquid form and use as a base for
  cooking other dishes, much like vegetable broths. Additionally, many recipes for
  beef broth include vegetables such as onions, carrots, and celery, further supporting
  this categorization.'
