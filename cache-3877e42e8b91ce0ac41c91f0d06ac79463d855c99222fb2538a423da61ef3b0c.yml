text: ' No. While "or vegetables" and "other vegetables" may seem similar, they are
  not necessarily the same thing and do not have to refer to the exact same set of
  items. For example, if you are listing different types of vegetables that can be
  used in a recipe, saying "bell peppers or vegetables" could imply that bell peppers
  are an option along with other vegetables, while "other vegetables" would specifically
  indicate any vegetable excluding the one(s) already mentioned. Therefore, it is
  generally best to keep these phrases separate unless the context clearly indicates
  that they can be used interchangeably.'
