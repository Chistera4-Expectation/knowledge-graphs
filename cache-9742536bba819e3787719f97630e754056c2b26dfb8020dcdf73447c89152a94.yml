  While canola oil and sesame oil may both fall under the category of edible vegetable
  oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come from different
  plants (canola oil is derived from rapeseed while sesame oil comes from sesame seeds),
  have distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses in cooking, making them unique
  within their broader classification.'
