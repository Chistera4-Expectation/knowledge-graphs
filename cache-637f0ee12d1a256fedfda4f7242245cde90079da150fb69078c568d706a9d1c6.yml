  Heather honey and strawberry honey are both types of honey, but they come from different
  sources and have distinct properties. Heather honey is made by bees that collect
  nectar primarily from heather plants, while strawberry honey is made by bees that
  gather nectar mainly from strawberries. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer to two separate
  varieties of honey with unique characteristics.'
