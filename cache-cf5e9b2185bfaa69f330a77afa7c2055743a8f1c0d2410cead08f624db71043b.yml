text: No, they should not be merged together. Hemp milk and macadamia milk are derived
  from different plant sources (hemp seeds and macadamia nuts, respectively) and have
  distinct nutritional profiles, even though they both fall under the broader category
  of plant-based milks. Therefore, they should be considered separate instances in
  a milk classification system.
