text: No, Catfish and Sashimi-grade fish should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of fish with distinct characteristics,
  preparation methods, and cultural associations. Catfish is a specific type of fish,
  while Sashimi-grade fish refers to a category of fish suitable for raw consumption
  in sashimi dishes.
