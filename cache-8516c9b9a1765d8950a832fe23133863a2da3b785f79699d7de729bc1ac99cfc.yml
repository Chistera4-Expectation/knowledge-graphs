text: ' The most adequate class for "Protein Powerhouse" is not among the options
  provided, as coffee and tea are both beverages rather than food items. However,
  if we were to choose between them based on protein content, coffee would have slightly
  more proteins compared to tea due to the presence of certain amino acids in it.
  But neither can truly be considered a Protein Powerhouse.'
