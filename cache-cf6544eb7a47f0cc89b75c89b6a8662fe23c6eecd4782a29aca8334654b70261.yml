text: ' No. Dried red pepper flakes and Scotch bonnet peppers are not semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they both belong to the same category (spices),
  they have different characteristics such as taste, appearance, and heat level. Therefore,
  it is important to keep them separate for accurate culinary and nutritional purposes.'
