  While both chicken broth and chicken salad are made with chicken and can be considered
  poultry-derived foods, they serve different purposes and have unique nutritional
  profiles. Chicken broth is typically consumed as a liquid, often used for cooking
  or sipped as a light meal or snack, while chicken salad is usually eaten as a solid
  food, served cold or at room temperature. Merging them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates would not accurately reflect their distinct culinary uses and nutritional
  differences.'
