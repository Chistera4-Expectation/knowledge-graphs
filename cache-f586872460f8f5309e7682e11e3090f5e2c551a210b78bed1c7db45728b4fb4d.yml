text: No, Avocado Oil and Olive Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct chemical
  compositions, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking and other applications.
  They should be treated as separate entities in a classification system.
