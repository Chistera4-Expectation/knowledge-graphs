text: No, Fresh Basil and Fresh Thyme should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both herbs and can be used in similar ways in cooking,
  they have distinct flavors, appearances, and nutritional profiles. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the differences between these two edible vegetables.
