  While both "Additional seasonings" and "Maggi seasoning cubes" may refer to items
  used for adding flavor to food during cooking, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they do not have exactly the same meaning or cover the exact
  same set of entities.


  "Additional seasonings" is a general term that could encompass any number of ingredients
  used to add flavor to food, including herbs, spices, salts, vinegars, oils, etc.,
  whereas "Maggi seasoning cubes" refers specifically to a branded product produced
  by Nestle that contains a combination of salt, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and other
  flavor enhancers. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  into one.'
