  In the context of edible vegetable oils, "grapeseed oil" and "vegetable oil for
  frying" are not necessarily interchangeable or identical. Grapeseed oil is a specific
  type of vegetable oil that is extracted from the seeds of grapes, while "vegetable
  oil for frying" is a more general term that can refer to any vegetable oil that
  is suitable for deep-frying foods. There may be some overlap in their uses and characteristics,
  but they have distinct differences in terms of flavor profile, nutritional content,
  and production processes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
