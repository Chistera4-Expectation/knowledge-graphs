  The two instances you mentioned do not appear to be semantic or ontological duplicates.


  The instance "- the quantity of juice in the container" refers to a specific amount
  of juice that is already present in a container. It implies a fixed value that has
  been measured and poured into the container.


  On the other hand, "tomato juice as needed" suggests a more flexible approach where
  tomato juice can be added to the recipe according to personal preference or need.
  This does not necessarily imply a fixed value, but rather allows for variation depending
  on the situation.


  Therefore, these two instances serve different purposes in describing the preparation
  of juice and are not duplicative.'
