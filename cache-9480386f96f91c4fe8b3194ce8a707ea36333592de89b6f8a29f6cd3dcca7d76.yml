  The two instances, "Buffalo wing sauce" and "Sauces," are not identical in meaning,
  even though they share some similarities. "Buffalo wing sauce" refers to a specific
  type of sauce used for buffalo wings, while "Sauces" is a broader term that encompasses
  various types of sauces. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate rather
  than merging them as duplicates.'
