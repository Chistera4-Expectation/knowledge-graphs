text: No, 'Hard Water' and 'Oxygenated Water' should not be merged together as they
  have different properties and characteristics. Hard Water refers to water with high
  mineral content, particularly calcium and magnesium ions, while Oxygenated Water
  refers to water with an increased concentration of dissolved oxygen. These are distinct
  concepts and should be treated as separate instances.
