  Sunflower seed oil and Tofu oil are two different vegetable oils with distinct chemical
  compositions, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Although they are both plant-based
  oils, they have different fatty acid profiles, vitamin content, and health benefits.
  Merging them as semantic and ontologic duplicates would not accurately represent
  the uniqueness and diversity of each oil.'
