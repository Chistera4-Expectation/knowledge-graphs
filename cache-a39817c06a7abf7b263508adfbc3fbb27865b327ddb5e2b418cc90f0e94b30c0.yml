  Mascarpone cheese and Parmesan cheese are two different cheeses with distinct nutritional
  profiles, textures, and flavor profiles. While they are both cheese, they belong
  to different cheese categories and have their own unique characteristics. Merging
  them together as semantic and ontologic duplicates would not accurately represent
  the distinctness and uniqueness of each cheese.'
