  While white rice and wild rice can both be classified under the broader category
  of "rice," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and growth processes. White rice is a refined
  grain that is high in carbohydrates but low in fiber and certain vitamins, while
  wild rice is a whole grain that is higher in protein, fiber, and various minerals
  than white rice. Additionally, white rice is typically grown in flooded paddies
  and is a cultivated variety of rice, whereas wild rice is actually a type of grass
  that grows in shallow water and is native to North America. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
