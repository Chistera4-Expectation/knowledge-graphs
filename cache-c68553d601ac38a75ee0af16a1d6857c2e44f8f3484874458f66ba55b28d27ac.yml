text: No, 'Grilled Bread' and 'Rye Bread' should not be merged together as they represent
  different types of bread. 'Grilled Bread' refers to a preparation method, while
  'Rye Bread' refers to a specific type of bread made from rye flour. They can both
  be instances of the 'Bread' class, but they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
