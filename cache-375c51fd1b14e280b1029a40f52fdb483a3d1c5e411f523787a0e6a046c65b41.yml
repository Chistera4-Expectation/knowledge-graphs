  The two instances, "Celery, sliced" and "bacon bits, diced vegetables," are not
  identical in their composition or nutritional content, even though they share some
  similarities in form (i.e., both being cut into small pieces). Celery is a vegetable
  that is naturally low in calories and fat, while bacon bits are made from meat and
  have a higher caloric and fat content. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
