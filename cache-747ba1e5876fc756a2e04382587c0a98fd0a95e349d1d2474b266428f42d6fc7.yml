text: No, Flaxseed Oil and Hazelnut Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  properties, nutritional profiles, and uses. Flaxseed Oil is rich in omega-3 fatty
  acids, while Hazelnut Oil contains more monounsaturated fats and a distinct hazelnut
  flavor. Merging them together would not accurately represent the differences between
  these oils.
