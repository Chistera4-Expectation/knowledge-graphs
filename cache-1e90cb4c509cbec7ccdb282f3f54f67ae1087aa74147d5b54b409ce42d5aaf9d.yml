  The two instances, "Black tea" and "Matcha green tea powder," are not identical
  in terms of their composition, preparation method, and nutritional content, despite
  both being derived from the leaves of Camellia sinensis. Black tea is fully fermented,
  whereas matcha green tea powder is made from the young leaves of the plant and is
  steamed or pan-fried, resulting in a different flavor and nutrient profile. As such,
  they can be considered distinct entities rather than duplicates.'
