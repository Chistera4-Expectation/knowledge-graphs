text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. Although both 'Ginger Tea' and 'Lemon
  Tea' are types of tea, they have distinct ingredients and flavors. Merging them
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates would not accurately represent the differences
  between these two beverages. They can both be considered as instances of the 'Tea'
  class, but they should not be merged as duplicates.
