text: Yes, in the Poultry-derived Food class, 'Chicken Broth' and 'chicken/vegetable
  stock' can be considered semantic and ontologic duplicates. Both are liquid preparations
  made by simmering chicken and/or vegetables in water, creating a flavorful base
  that can be used in various recipes. However, it's essential to note that the terms
  might not be entirely interchangeable, as some recipes might use different ingredients
  or preparation methods to create distinct flavors.
