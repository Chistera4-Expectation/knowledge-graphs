text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct differences. Duck broth
  is a liquid that results from cooking duck in water, while duck soup is a dish made
  with duck broth as the base, often containing additional ingredients such as vegetables,
  noodles, or rice. Although they share a common ingredient (duck), their preparation
  and composition are different.
