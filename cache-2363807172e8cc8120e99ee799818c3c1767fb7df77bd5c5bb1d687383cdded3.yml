text: No, 'Salted Butter' and 'Spreadable Butter' should not be merged together as
  they are different types of butter with distinct characteristics. Salted Butter
  contains added salt, while Spreadable Butter is designed to be easily spreadable
  at room temperature and may have different ingredients or processing methods.
