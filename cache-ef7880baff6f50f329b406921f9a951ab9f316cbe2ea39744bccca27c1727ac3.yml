text: ' No. Green onions (also known as scallions) and red onions are distinct types
  of vegetables with different culinary uses, flavors, and appearances. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both fall
  under the broader category of "onions," they have unique characteristics that warrant
  their separate classification.'
