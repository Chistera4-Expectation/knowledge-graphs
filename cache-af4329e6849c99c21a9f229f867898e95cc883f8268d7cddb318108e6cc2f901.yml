text: No, distilled water and purified water are not the same. Although both are treated
  to remove impurities, distilled water specifically goes through the process of distillation,
  while purified water can be treated through various methods, such as reverse osmosis,
  deionization, or UV treatment. These different processes can result in slightly
  different compositions and qualities of the water. Therefore, it is not accurate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
