text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both "Duck Nuggets" and "Duck"
  are poultry-derived foods, they are distinct items with different processing and
  preparation methods. "Duck Nuggets" are a processed food product, while "Duck" refers
  to the whole animal or unprocessed cuts of meat. Merging them would result in a
  loss of specificity and clarity in the classification.
