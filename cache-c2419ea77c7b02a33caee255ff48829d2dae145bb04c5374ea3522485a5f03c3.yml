  The two instances, "Boneless, skinless chicken breast" and "Chicken pieces," are
  not identical in their entirety. Although they both contain chicken, boneless, skinless
  chicken breasts are leaner and have less fat than chicken pieces, which may include
  fattier parts like thighs, drums, or wings. Moreover, chicken pieces can have bones
  and skin, whereas boneless, skinless chicken breasts do not. As a result, it is
  acceptable to keep them apart rather than merging them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
