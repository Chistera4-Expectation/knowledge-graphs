text: ' No, Barbecue sauce and Oyster sauce should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both sauces, they have different ingredients,
  flavors, uses, and cultural origins. Barbecue sauce is typically made with tomatoes,
  vinegar, sugar, and various spices, and it is used as a marinade, basting sauce,
  or condiment for barbecued and grilled foods. Oyster sauce, on the other hand, is
  a savory brown sauce made from oysters, water, and cornstarch, and it is commonly
  used in Chinese cuisine to add depth and umami flavor to stir-fries, braises, and
  dipping sauces. Therefore, they represent distinct concepts that warrant separate
  instances in a knowledge graph or ontology.'
