text: ' No, these two instances should not be merged as they refer to different types
  of beef with distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. While both are related
  to beef, merging them would result in loss of specific information about how the
  cattle were fed, which can impact the resulting meat''s properties. Grass-fed beef
  refers specifically to animals that have eaten only grasses throughout their lives,
  while "beef" could include any type of cow meat without specifying the feeding method.
  Keeping these separate allows users to make more informed decisions based on their
  preferences or dietary needs.'
