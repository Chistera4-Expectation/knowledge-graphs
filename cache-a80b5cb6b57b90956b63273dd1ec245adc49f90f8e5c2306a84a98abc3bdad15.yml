text: ' No. While both "Bread" and "bread for serving" may seem similar, they serve
  different purposes within a classification system from a dietary perspective. "Bread"
  typically refers to various types of baked goods made from flour, water, and yeast,
  while "bread for serving" could refer specifically to bread that is set aside for
  use during meals, such as sliced bread kept in a breadbasket on the table. Merging
  these two concepts might not accurately reflect their distinct roles in a dietary
  context.'
