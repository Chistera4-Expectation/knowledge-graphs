  While both "Bread" and "Breadcrumbs" may fall under the general category of food
  or baked goods, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They refer to distinct
  types of food products with different ingredients, uses, and nutritional profiles.
  Therefore, it is appropriate for them to remain separate instances within the Bread
  class or any other classification system.'
