text: No, 'Quail Eggs' and 'Quail Tenders' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from quails, they are different
  food products with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. 'Quail Eggs'
  refer to the eggs of quails, while 'Quail Tenders' refer to a specific cut of quail
  meat.
