text: ' No. Black pepper and cayenne pepper are two different types of spices with
  distinct flavors, appearances, and uses in cooking. Therefore, they should not be
  merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are used to add flavor
  to dishes, black pepper is milder and earthy, while cayenne pepper is hotter and
  more pungent due to its higher capsaicin content.'
