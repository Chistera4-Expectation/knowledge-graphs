  While both chili peppers and red bell peppers are types of peppers, they have different
  flavors, textures, and culinary uses. Chili peppers are typically smaller, fiery
  hot, and used in dishes for their heat and spice, while red bell peppers are larger,
  sweeter, and often used in salads, stir-fries, and other dishes for their crunch
  and sweetness. They can be considered separate instances in the Edible Vegetable
  class.'
