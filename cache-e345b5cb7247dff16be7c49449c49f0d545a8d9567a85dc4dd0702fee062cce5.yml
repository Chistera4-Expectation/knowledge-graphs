  While both "mechanically separated meat" and "thinly sliced meat" are types of poultry-derived
  food, they do not represent semantic and ontological duplicates. Mechanically separated
  meat refers to the paste-like meat produced by removing bones by forcing them through
  a sieve or similar device; it is typically used in processed foods like hot dogs,
  chicken nuggets, and reformed meats (USDA). On the other hand, thinly sliced meat
  describes how the meat has been physically cut for consumption, which can apply
  to various cuts from different poultry species (Merriam Webster). Therefore, these
  two terms have distinct meanings and uses within their respective contexts.'
