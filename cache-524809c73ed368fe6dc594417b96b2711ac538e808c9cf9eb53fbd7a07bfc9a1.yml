text: No, "Ostrich Eggs" and "Ostrich Gizzards" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from ostriches, they are different
  parts of the animal with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Ostrich
  eggs are a source of protein and other nutrients, while ostrich gizzards are a type
  of organ meat.
