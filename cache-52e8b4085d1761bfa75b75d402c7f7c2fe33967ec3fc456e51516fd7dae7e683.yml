text: ' No. Honey mustard dressing and poppy seed dressing are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, as they have different ingredients and flavors. While both are types
  of salad dressings, honey mustard dressing is typically made with honey, mustard,
  vinegar or lemon juice, and oil, while poppy seed dressing contains poppy seeds,
  sugar, onion, vegetable oil, and white wine or cider vinegar. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
