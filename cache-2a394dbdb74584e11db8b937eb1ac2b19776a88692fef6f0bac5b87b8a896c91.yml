  While pumpkin seeds and quinoa seeds can both be classified under the broader category
  of "edible seeds," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come from
  different plants, have different nutritional profiles, and are used in different
  ways in cooking and food preparation. Therefore, it is important to maintain them
  as separate instances.'
