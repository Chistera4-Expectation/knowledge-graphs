text: ' No. Alfalfa honey and orange blossom honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While they may both fall under the category of "honey," they have distinct
  properties that set them apart from one another. Alfalfa honey is made primarily
  from the nectar of alfalfa flowers, while orange blossom honey is made from the
  nectar of citrus flowers (such as orange or lemon). These differences can impact
  their flavor, color, and other characteristics, making them unique varieties of
  honey. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two types of honey
  into a single concept.'
