text: ' No. Caesar Dressing and Citrus Ginger Dressing are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While they may both be types of dressings, they have distinct ingredients
  and flavors. Caesar Dressing is typically made with anchovies, garlic, lemon juice,
  Worcestershire sauce, and olive oil, among other ingredients, while Citrus Ginger
  Dressing usually contains citrus juices, ginger, vinegar or oil, sugar, and various
  spices. Therefore, they represent unique entities in the domain of dressings.'
