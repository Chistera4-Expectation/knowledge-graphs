text: ' No. Black-eyed peas and peas are not semantic and ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged together. Although they both belong to the legume family, black-eyed
  peas (Vigna unguiculata) are a specific type of bean with a distinctive appearance
  and taste, while "peas" is a broader category that includes many different types
  of plants such as garden peas (Pisum sativum), snow peas, sugar snap peas, etc.
  Therefore, it would be incorrect to merge them as duplicates.'
