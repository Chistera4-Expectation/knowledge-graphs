text: ' No, I would not recommend merging "grass-fed" and "pasture-raised" beef into
  the same instance as they have different but related meanings. Grass-fed beef specifically
  refers to cattle that are fed only grass and other foraged foods throughout their
  lives, while pasture-raised beef implies that the animals were allowed to roam and
  graze freely on open fields (which may include both grasses and legumes) during
  some part of their life cycle. While there can be overlap between these two terms,
  they do not necessarily imply the exact same thing. Therefore, it might be more
  appropriate to keep them separate to maintain clear distinctions and avoid confusion.'
