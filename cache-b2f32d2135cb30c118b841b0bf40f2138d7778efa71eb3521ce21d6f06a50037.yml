text: No, they should not be merged together. While both instances are derived from
  guinea fowl, they represent different food products with distinct preparation methods
  and nutritional profiles. Guinea Fowl Gizzards are organ meats, while Guinea Fowl
  Meatballs are formed from ground meat and may contain additional ingredients such
  as breadcrumbs, herbs, and spices. Merging them together would not accurately reflect
  these differences.
