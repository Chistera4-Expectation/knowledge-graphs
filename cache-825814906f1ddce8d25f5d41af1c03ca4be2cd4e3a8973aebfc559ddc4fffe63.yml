  Although both ground cloves and ground nutmeg are spices and may have some similar
  uses in cooking, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come from
  different plants (Syzygium aromaticum for cloves and Myristica fragrans for nutmeg)
  and possess distinct flavors, appearances, chemical compositions, and health benefits.
  Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate entities in any classification
  system, including culinary arts and nutrition.'
