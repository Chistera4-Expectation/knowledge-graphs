text: ' "Food Dressing" could be the most adequate class for acids, as it often includes
  acidic ingredients like vinegar or lemon juice. However, it''s important to note
  that acids can also be found in other food categories such as "Sauce" (e.g., tomato
  sauce) and "Food Seasoning" (e.g., citric acid).'
