text: ' "Butter" would be the most adequate class for "Ghee". Ghee is a type of clarified
  butter that originated in India, where it is commonly used in cooking and religious
  ceremonies. Like butter, ghee is made from the fat of cow''s milk, but it has been
  simmered longer to remove all water and milk solids, resulting in a golden-colored
  oil with a nutty flavor. Compared to other dairy products such as cheese, milk,
  and yogurt, which contain varying amounts of protein, lactose, and calcium, ghee
  is almost pure fat and therefore belongs to the same category as butter.'
