text: 'As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on the ingredients and nutritional
  aspects of the sauces, but I''m not a computer scientist or ontology expert. From
  a dietary perspective, mustard sauce and teriyaki sauce are different in terms of
  ingredients, flavor, and nutritional content.


  Mustard sauce typically contains mustard seeds, vinegar, salt, and sometimes other
  spices, while teriyaki sauce is made of soy sauce, mirin (sweet rice wine), sugar,
  and sometimes other ingredients like garlic, ginger, and sesame seeds. They have
  distinct flavors and nutritional profiles.


  However, in the context of a programming language or ontology, the decision to merge
  or separate these instances would depend on the specific requirements and goals
  of the system. In general, it''s best to consult with a computer scientist or ontology
  expert to determine the most appropriate approach for your specific needs.'
