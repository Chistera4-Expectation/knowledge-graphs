text: ' Yes. Green peas and peas typically refer to the same vegetable (Pisum sativum)
  in its immature stage, when the seeds are still green and tender. Therefore, they
  can be considered semantic and ontological duplicates. It is common for people to
  use the term "peas" as a catch-all phrase that includes both mature yellow peas
  and young green peas. For clarity, it may be helpful to specify whether you mean
  dried or fresh peas, but merging them conceptually makes sense due to their shared
  species identity.'
