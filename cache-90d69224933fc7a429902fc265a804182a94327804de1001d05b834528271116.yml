text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different cuts of beef with
  distinct characteristics and uses in cooking. Corned beef brisket is a specific
  cut of beef that has been cured in a brine solution, while thinly sliced beef can
  refer to various cuts of beef that have been sliced thinly, such as sirloin or flank
  steak. Although both are types of beef, they are not duplicates in terms of semantics
  or ontology.
