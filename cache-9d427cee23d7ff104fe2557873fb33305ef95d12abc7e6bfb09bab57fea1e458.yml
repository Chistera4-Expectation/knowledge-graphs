text: ' No. Parmesan cheese and shredded mozzarella cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, and they should not be merged together. While both are types of cheese,
  they have distinct characteristics such as taste, texture, origin, and typical uses
  that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it is important to keep these
  two concepts separate when discussing or categorizing different types of cheese.'
