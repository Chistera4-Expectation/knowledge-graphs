  While both Sichuan peppercorns and "pepper to taste" are related to adding flavor
  to food through the use of spices derived from pepper plants, they serve different
  purposes and cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.


  Sichuan peppercorns refer to a specific type of dried berry from the prickly ash
  tree that has a unique aroma and numbing sensation when consumed. It is used as
  a seasoning in certain cuisines such as Chinese and Tibetan dishes.


  On the other hand, "pepper to taste" refers to the general instruction for adding
  black or white pepper (or sometimes even other types of peppers) to adjust the level
  of spicy heat according to personal preference. This can apply to various dishes
  across different culinary traditions.


  Therefore, despite their shared connection to pepper plants, these two terms represent
  distinct concepts with separate uses in cooking and should not be merged together
  as duplicates.'
