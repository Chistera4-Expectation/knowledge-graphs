text: ' No, baking powder and chili powder are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They serve different purposes in cooking and have distinct ingredients. Baking powder
  is a chemical leavening agent used in baked goods to make them rise, while chili
  powder is a blend of spices used to add flavor to dishes, particularly those with
  a spicy kick. Therefore, they should remain separate instances.'
