text: As a dietician, my focus is on the nutritional aspects of bread. From that perspective,
  Challah and Sourdough Bread can be considered different types of bread with distinct
  nutritional profiles, ingredients, and preparation methods. Therefore, they should
  not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
