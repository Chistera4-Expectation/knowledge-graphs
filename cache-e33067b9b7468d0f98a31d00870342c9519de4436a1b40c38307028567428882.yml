  While both dishes do contain chicken, they are distinct foods with unique ingredients
  and preparation methods. Chicken parmesan is typically made by breading and frying
  chicken before baking it with tomato sauce and cheese, while chicken soup usually
  involves cooking chicken in broth with various vegetables and seasonings. Therefore,
  they should not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
