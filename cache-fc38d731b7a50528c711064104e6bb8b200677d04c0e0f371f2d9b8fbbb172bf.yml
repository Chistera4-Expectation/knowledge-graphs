text: No, they should not be merged together as they have distinct properties and
  purposes. Electrolyte water contains added electrolytes to help replenish fluids
  and minerals, while sparkling water is carbonated and does not have added electrolytes.
  These differences make them separate and distinct instances in the Drinking Water
  class.
