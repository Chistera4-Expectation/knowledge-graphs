text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different types of poultry-derived
  meatballs. While they both fall under the Poultry-derived Food class, they are distinct
  in terms of their ingredients and flavors. Guinea fowl and pheasant are different
  types of birds and therefore, their meatballs would have unique characteristics.
