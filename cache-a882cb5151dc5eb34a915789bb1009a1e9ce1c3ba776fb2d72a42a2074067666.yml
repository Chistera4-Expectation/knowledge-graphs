text: ' No. While basil leaves are indeed a type of leafy green, they have distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and nutritional profiles that differentiate them from
  other leafy greens like spinach, kale, or collard greens. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
