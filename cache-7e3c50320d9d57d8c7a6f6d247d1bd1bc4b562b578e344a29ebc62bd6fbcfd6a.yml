text: No, the instances 'Blewit Mushroom' and 'Velvet Pioppini Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, appearances, and flavors.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent the variety of edible mushrooms
  and could lead to confusion.
