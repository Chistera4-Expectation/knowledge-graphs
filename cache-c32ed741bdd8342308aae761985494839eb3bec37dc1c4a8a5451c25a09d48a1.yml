text: No, they should not be merged as they serve different purposes and have distinct
  ingredients. Seasoning cubes typically contain a mix of salt, spices, and flavor
  enhancers, while soy sauce is made from fermented soybeans and wheat, providing
  a unique umami flavor. Both can be used for seasoning, but they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
