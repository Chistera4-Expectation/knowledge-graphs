text: Yes, if the instances 'Fresh Mozzarella Cheese' and 'Mozzarella' have the same
  properties and represent the same type of cheese, they can be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. However, if there are differences in their properties
  or characteristics, they should be treated as separate instances.
