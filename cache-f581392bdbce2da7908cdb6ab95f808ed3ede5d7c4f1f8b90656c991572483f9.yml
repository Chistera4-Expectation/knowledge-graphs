text: As a dietician, I would recommend not merging 'Date syrup' and 'Yacon syrup'
  together as they are distinct sweeteners with different nutritional profiles, origins,
  and uses. Although they may share the commonality of being natural sweeteners, they
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
