text: ' No. French dressing and soy sauce dressing are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  While both may be used as dressings, they have distinct ingredients and flavors.
  French dressing is typically made with oil, vinegar, sugar, and various spices,
  while soy sauce dressing uses soy sauce as its base ingredient.'
