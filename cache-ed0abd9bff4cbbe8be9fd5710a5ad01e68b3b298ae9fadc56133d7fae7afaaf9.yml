text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct poultry-derived
  food items. Pheasant Drumsticks are a specific cut of meat, while Pheasant Stock
  is a liquid cooking ingredient made from simmering pheasant bones and possibly other
  ingredients. While both are derived from pheasants, they serve different culinary
  purposes and should be kept as separate instances.
