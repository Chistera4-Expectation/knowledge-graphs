text: No, the instances 'Coral Shrimp' and 'Mantis Shrimp' should not be merged together.
  While they are both crustaceans, they belong to different families and have distinct
  characteristics. Coral shrimp are members of the family Palaemonidae, while mantis
  shrimp belong to the family Stomatopoda. Merging them as duplicates would not accurately
  represent the unique features of each species.
