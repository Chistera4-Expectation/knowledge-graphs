text: No, "Turkey Stock" and "Turkey Thighs" should not be merged together as they
  represent different types of poultry-derived food. Turkey Stock is a liquid derived
  from cooking turkey bones and meat, while Turkey Thighs are a specific cut of turkey
  meat. Although they are related, they are distinct food items.
