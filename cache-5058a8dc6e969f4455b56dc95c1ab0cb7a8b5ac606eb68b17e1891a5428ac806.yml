text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Infused
  water and spring water are different types of drinking water with distinct properties.
  Infused water refers to water that has been flavored with fruits, herbs, or other
  natural ingredients, while spring water is water that comes from a natural underground
  source and has not been treated or purified. Therefore, they are not duplicates
  in terms of their definition and characteristics.
