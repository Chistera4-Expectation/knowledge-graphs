text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they
  both fall under the category of yogurt, they have different characteristics and
  nutritional profiles due to the presence of fruit and the use of whole milk, respectively.
  Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the Yogurt class.
