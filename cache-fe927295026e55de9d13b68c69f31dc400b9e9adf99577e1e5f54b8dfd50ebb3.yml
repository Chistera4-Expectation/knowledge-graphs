text: No, they should not be merged. While they share the common attribute of being
  a type of sauce, 'Aioli sauce' represents a specific type of sauce (garlic mayonnaise),
  whereas 'Sauce' is a general term for a wide variety of condiments. Merging them
  would not accurately reflect the differences between them.
