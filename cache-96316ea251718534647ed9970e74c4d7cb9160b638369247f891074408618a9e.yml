text: "As a dietician, I can provide my professional opinion. From a nutritional perspective,\
  \ 'Butter Blend' and 'Light Butter' are not semantic and ontological duplicates.\
  \ Although they both fall under the broader category of butter, they have distinct\
  \ differences in their nutritional composition and ingredients. \n\nButter Blend\
  \ typically refers to a mixture of butter and other fats, such as vegetable oil,\
  \ to reduce the overall saturated fat content. Light Butter, on the other hand,\
  \ is often created by reducing the overall fat content in comparison to regular\
  \ butter. The specific ingredients and nutritional information will vary between\
  \ different brands and types of Butter Blend and Light Butter.\n\nIn conclusion,\
  \ the answer is no; Butter Blend and Light Butter should not be merged together\
  \ as semantic and ontologic duplicates due to their different nutritional compositions\
  \ and ingredients."
