  While pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds have some similarities (for example, they
  are both types of edible seeds), they also have important differences that make
  them distinct from each other. Pumpkin seeds tend to be flat and oval-shaped with
  a white outer shell and green inner seed, while sunflower seeds are smaller, rounder,
  and usually black and white striped. They also differ in terms of their nutritional
  content and culinary uses. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge these two instances
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
