text: No, the instances 'Blue Cheese' and 'Pecorino Romano cheese' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are distinct types of cheese
  with different characteristics, production methods, and origins. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the variety of cheeses available.
