  While chili powder and garlic powder may share some similarities as food seasonings,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinctly different
  flavors, appearances, and uses in cooking. Chili powder is typically made from ground
  dried red chilies and often contains other spices like cumin, oregano, and garlic,
  while garlic powder is simply dehydrated and finely ground garlic cloves. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
