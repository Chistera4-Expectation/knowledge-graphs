text: ' No. While "crab" can refer to both an individual crustacean and the broader
  category of similar animals, it is common for taxonomic categories to have plural
  forms that represent multiple individuals within the group. Therefore, it is not
  necessary or appropriate to merge "Crab" and "Crabs" as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Instead, they serve different purposes in language and categorization.'
