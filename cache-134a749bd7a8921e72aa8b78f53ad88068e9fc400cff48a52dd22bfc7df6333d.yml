text: No, Hoisin sauce and Sriracha sauce should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of sauces, they have different
  flavors, ingredients, and uses in cooking. Hoisin sauce is a thick, sweet, and salty
  sauce commonly used in Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine, while Sriracha sauce is a
  spicy, tangy sauce made from chili peppers, vinegar, garlic, and sugar, often used
  in Thai and Vietnamese dishes. Merging them together would not accurately represent
  their unique characteristics and applications in the culinary world.
