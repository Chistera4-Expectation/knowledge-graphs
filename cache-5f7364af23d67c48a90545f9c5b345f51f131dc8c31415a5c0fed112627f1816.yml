text: No, Red onion and Yellow onion should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both onion varieties, they have distinct differences
  in appearance, taste, and culinary uses. They should remain separate instances in
  the Edible Vegetable class to maintain accurate and useful information.
