text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'Butter Blend' and 'Flavored
  Butter' are types of butter, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.
  'Butter Blend' usually refers to a mixture of butter and other fats (such as margarine
  or vegetable oil) to create a spreadable consistency, while 'Flavored Butter' refers
  to butter that has been mixed with additional ingredients, such as herbs, spices,
  or sweeteners, to enhance its taste. Merging these two classes would not accurately
  represent the differences between them.
