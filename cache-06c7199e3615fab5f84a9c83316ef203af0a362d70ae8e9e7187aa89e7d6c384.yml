  While sesame oil and walnut oil are both edible vegetable oils, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they come from different plants (sesame seeds
  vs. walnuts) and have distinct flavors, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking.
  Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate within an Edible Vegetal Oil
  classification system.'
