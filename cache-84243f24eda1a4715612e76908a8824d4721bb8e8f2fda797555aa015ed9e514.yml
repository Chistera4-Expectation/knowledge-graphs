text: 'As a dietician, my answer is based on the context of the question, which seems
  to be about semantics and ontology rather than nutrition.


  If the question is about merging ''Barbecue sauce'' and ''Curry sauce'' as duplicates
  solely based on their names, then the answer is no. Although both are sauces, they
  have different ingredients, flavors, and cultural origins, making them distinct
  entities.


  However, if the question is about merging them based on similar nutritional properties,
  the answer would depend on the specific nutritional composition of each sauce. If
  their nutritional profiles are similar, it could be considered for merging them
  under a broader category for dietary purposes.'
