text: ' No. Quinoa seeds and sesame seeds are distinct types of edible seeds that
  have different nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and botanical origins. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. It is important
  to maintain separate categories for each type of seed to accurately represent their
  unique properties and characteristics.'
