  While both Comb Honey and Organic Clover Honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics that make them different from each other. Comb Honey is honey still
  contained within the original hexagonal wax cells of the beehive, while Organic
  Clover Honey is made exclusively from clover nectar and has been certified organic
  according to certain production standards. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
