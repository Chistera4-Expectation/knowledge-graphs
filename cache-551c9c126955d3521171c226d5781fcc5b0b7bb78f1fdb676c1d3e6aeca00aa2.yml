text: ' No. Cherry blossom honey and orange blossom honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged together. While they may both fall under the
  category of "honey," they have distinct flavors and properties that set them apart
  from one another. Merging these two classes would result in a loss of important
  distinctions between different types of honey.'
