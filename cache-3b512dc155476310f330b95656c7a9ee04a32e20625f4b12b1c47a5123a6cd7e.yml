  While both "additional seasonings" and "seasoning cubes" may seem similar, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to different types
  of food seasonings.


  "Additional seasonings" typically refers to any spices, herbs, salts, peppers, or
  other flavor enhancers that can be added to a dish beyond what is already included
  in a recipe. They provide an opportunity for customization based on personal taste
  preferences.


  On the other hand, "seasoning cubes" (also known as stock cubes) are concentrated
  bouillon-like products made from vegetables, meat extracts, and various seasonings.
  These cubes dissolve easily in hot water and serve as a base for soups, stews, sauces,
  and rice dishes. While it is true that some seasoning cubes contain additional seasonings
  like salt, pepper, garlic powder, or onion powder, their primary purpose is to add
  savory depth and umami flavors rather than just enhance aroma or pungency.


  Therefore, merging these two concepts would overlook the distinct differences between
  them, which could lead to confusion when discussing food preparation techniques
  and ingredient choices with clients.'
