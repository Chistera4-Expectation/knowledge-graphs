text: No, Quail Sausage and Quail Wings should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are derived from quail, they are different types of poultry-derived
  food with distinct nutritional profiles and preparation methods. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the distinct characteristics of each food item.
