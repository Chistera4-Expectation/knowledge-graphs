text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  instances are derived from pheasant meat, they are different food items with distinct
  preparation methods. 'Pheasant Meat' refers to the raw or cooked meat from a pheasant,
  while 'Pheasant Meatballs' are a specific dish made from ground pheasant meat mixed
  with other ingredients and shaped into balls.
