text: " No.\n\nWhile both poppy seed dressing and wasabi dressing are types of food\
  \ dressings, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. Semantically, they\
  \ have different ingredients and flavors, with poppy seed dressing typically containing\
  \ poppy seeds, vinegar, oil, sugar, and mustard, while wasabi dressing contains\
  \ wasabi, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and sometimes other ingredients like garlic or\
  \ ginger. Ontologically, they serve different purposes and are used in different\
  \ contexts \u2013 for example, poppy seed dressing is often paired with salads that\
  \ have sweet or fruity elements, while wasabi dressing is commonly served with sushi\
  \ or other Japanese-inspired dishes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge\
  \ these two instances as duplicates."
