text: As a dietician, I would suggest that "Non-Dairy Yogurt" and "Yogurt" should
  not be merged together as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While
  both are categorized as yogurts, they differ in their ingredients and nutritional
  content. "Non-Dairy Yogurt" is made from non-dairy milk alternatives, such as almond,
  soy, or coconut milk, while traditional "Yogurt" is made from dairy milk. The nutritional
  profiles and dietary needs they fulfill are different, so it's essential to maintain
  separate classifications.
