text: No, the instances 'Juice' and 'Tomato juice' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Juice' is a general term for a drink made from
  the extraction or pressing of the natural liquid contained in fruits and vegetables,
  while 'Tomato juice' is a specific type of juice made from tomatoes. Although they
  are both juices, they are different in terms of their ingredients and characteristics.
