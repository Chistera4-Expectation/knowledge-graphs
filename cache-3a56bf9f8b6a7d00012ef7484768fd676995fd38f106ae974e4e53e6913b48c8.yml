text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of yogurt, they
  have different properties and characteristics. Bulgarian Yogurt is a traditional
  yogurt made with specific bacterial cultures, while Frozen Yogurt is a frozen dessert
  made with yogurt. They should be kept as separate instances in the Yogurt class.
