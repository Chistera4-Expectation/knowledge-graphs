text: As a dietician, my focus is on the nutritional aspects of food rather than the
  specific classification of food items. However, from a semantic and ontological
  standpoint, 'Lassi Yogurt' and 'Yogurt' are not exact duplicates, as they refer
  to different types of products derived from yogurt. 'Lassi Yogurt' refers to a specific
  yogurt-based drink, while 'Yogurt' refers to a broader category of fermented dairy
  products. Therefore, the answer is no. They should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates.
