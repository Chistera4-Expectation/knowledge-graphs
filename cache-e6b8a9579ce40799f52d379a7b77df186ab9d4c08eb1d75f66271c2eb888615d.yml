text: No, they should not be merged as they have different flavor profiles and ingredients.
  Chili bean sauce typically contains fermented soybeans, chili peppers, and spices,
  while curry sauce is made with a blend of spices like turmeric, coriander, and cumin,
  often with the addition of coconut milk or yogurt. Although they may both be used
  as condiments or sauces, they have distinct flavors and uses.
