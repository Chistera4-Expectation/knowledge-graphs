text: ' The most adequate class name for "Flavorings" would be "Seasoning". This is
  because seasonings encompass a wide range of substances used to enhance the flavor,
  taste, or aroma of food. Food dressings and sauces are types of seasonings that
  provide additional texture or moisture, while spices are specific types of seasonings
  derived from plants. Sweeteners can also affect the flavor but primarily serve to
  add sweetness rather than enhancing savory or umami flavors.'
