text: No, Corn Oil and Safflower Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they both belong to the category of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct chemical compositions, properties, and uses. Merging them would not
  accurately represent the differences between the two oils.
