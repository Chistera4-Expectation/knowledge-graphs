  Although both black rice and rice paper wrappers are related to rice, they have
  different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Black rice is a whole grain
  that contains fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals. It can be cooked and consumed
  like other types of rice. On the other hand, rice paper wrappers are thin sheets
  made from ground rice and water, which are often used for rolling and wrapping Vietnamese-style
  fresh spring rolls. They contain very few calories and little nutrients since they
  are typically not eaten on their own but rather used as a wrapper. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
