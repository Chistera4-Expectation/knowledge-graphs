text: As a dietician, I would not recommend merging "Duck Tenders" and "Duck" as they
  have different nutritional compositions and culinary applications. Although they
  both come from the same animal, duck tenders are a specific cut of meat that may
  have a different fat content and cooking method compared to the whole duck. Therefore,
  I would answer "no" to merging them as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
