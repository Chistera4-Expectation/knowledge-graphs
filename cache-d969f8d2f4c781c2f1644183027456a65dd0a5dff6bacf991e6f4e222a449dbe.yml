  While canola oil and sunflower oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, sources, and production
  methods. Therefore, it would not be accurate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.


  Canola oil is derived from the rapeseed plant (Brassica napus), while sunflower
  oil comes from the seeds of the sunflower plant (Helianthus annuus). They also differ
  in their fatty acid composition: canola oil has a higher amount of monounsaturated
  fats (mostly oleic acid) compared to sunflower oil, which contains more polyunsaturated
  fats (primarily linoleic acid). Additionally, there may be variations in flavor,
  smoke point, and stability depending on the specific type of each oil.


  For these reasons, maintaining separate categories for canola oil and sunflower
  oil ensures greater accuracy when discussing various aspects related to nutrition,
  cooking applications, and other relevant factors.'
