text: ' No. Honey Lime Dressing and Olive Oil Dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. While both may be used as dressings, they have distinct ingredients
  and characteristics. Honey Lime Dressing typically includes honey, lime juice, olive
  oil, vinegar or lemon juice, garlic, and spices, while Olive Oil Dressing is simply
  made of olive oil and sometimes seasoned with herbs, salt, pepper, or other flavorings.'
