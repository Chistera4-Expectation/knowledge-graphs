  Although long-grain rice and short-grain rice may fall under the broader category
  of "rice," they have distinct differences in terms of their physical properties,
  culinary uses, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Here are some reasons why:


  1. Physical Properties: Long-grain rice has a length that is at least twice its
  width, resulting in separate grains after cooking with a light, fluffy texture.
  Short-grain rice, on the other hand, has a shorter length (about equal to its width)
  and tends to stick together when cooked due to its higher starch content.

  2. Culinary Uses: Due to their different textures and flavors, these two types of
  rice are used for various dishes. Long-grain rice is ideal for pilafs, salads, and
  side dishes where you want individual grains to remain separated. In contrast, short-grain
  rice is commonly used in sushi, risotto, paella, and desserts like rice pudding
  because of its creamy consistency.

  3. Nutritional Profiles: While both long-grain and short-grain rice provide carbohydrates,
  fiber, and small amounts of protein, there can be variations between specific varieties
  and brands. For instance, brown long-grain rice generally contains more fiber than
  white short-grain rice. Thus, merging them would lead to an oversimplification of
  their unique characteristics.


  In summary, long-grain rice and short-grain rice serve different purposes based
  on their physical attributes, culinary applications, and nutritional values; hence,
  they should not be treated as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
