text: ' The most adequate class for ''pastrami'' would be ''Poultry-derived Food''
  or ''Meat-derived Food'' as pastrami is traditionally made from beef but can also
  be made from other meats such as poultry. However, if we have to choose from the
  provided options, ''Poultry-derived Food'' would be more appropriate since it includes
  all types of meat-based foods including beef.'
