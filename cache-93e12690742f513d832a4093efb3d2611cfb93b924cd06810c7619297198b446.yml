text: No, 'Ostrich Broth' and 'Ostrich Thighs' should not be merged as they are different
  types of poultry-derived foods. Ostrich Broth is a liquid derived from cooking ostrich
  meat and bones, while Ostrich Thighs refer to the meat from the thigh part of the
  ostrich. They have distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses, so they should
  be treated as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
