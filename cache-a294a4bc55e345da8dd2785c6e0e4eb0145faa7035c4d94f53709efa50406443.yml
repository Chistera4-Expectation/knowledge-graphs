text: 'As a dietician, I can provide some input on the tea class, but the decision
  to merge instances as semantic and ontological duplicates is more related to the
  specific context and purpose of the classification system.


  In general, Jasmine Tea and Lemon Tea are different types of tea with distinct flavors
  and characteristics. Jasmine Tea is made by combining green tea leaves with jasmine
  flowers, while Lemon Tea is typically a black tea infused with lemon flavor. These
  differences would suggest that they should not be merged as duplicates in a tea
  classification system.


  However, if the classification system is specifically focused on the presence of
  citrus flavor, then Lemon Tea and Jasmine Tea might be considered as semantic duplicates
  due to both containing a citrus-like aroma. In this case, it would depend on the
  purpose of the classification system and the specific criteria used to determine
  duplicates.


  In conclusion, the answer to whether ''Jasmine Tea'' and ''Lemon Tea'' should be
  merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates depends on the context and purpose of
  the tea classification system.'
