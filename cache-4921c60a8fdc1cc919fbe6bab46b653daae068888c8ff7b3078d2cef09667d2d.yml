text: No, Ciabatta Bread and Cornbread should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct types of bread with different ingredients
  and preparation methods. While they both fall under the broader category of "bread,"
  they are unique and should be treated as separate instances within the Bread class.
