  While avocado dressing and blue cheese dressing may have some similarities as food
  dressings, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates because they consist
  of different ingredients, flavors, textures, nutritional profiles, and uses. Merging
  them would lose this essential information about each distinct type of dressing.'
