text: No, the instances 'Redfish' and 'Stockfish' should not be merged together as
  they represent two distinct types of fish. Redfish, also known as red drum, is a
  type of fish found in the Atlantic Ocean, while Stockfish refers to a method of
  preserving fish, typically cod, by drying it in the open air. Although both are
  related to fish, they have different meanings and should not be considered as duplicates.
