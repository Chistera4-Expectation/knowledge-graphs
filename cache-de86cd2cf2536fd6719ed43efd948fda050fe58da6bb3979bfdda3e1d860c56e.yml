text: No, "Duck Sausage" and "Turkey Sausage" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of poultry-derived sausages,
  they come from different animals and may have different nutritional compositions,
  flavors, and uses in cooking. They should be treated as distinct instances within
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
