text: No, Arborio Rice and White Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have different
  properties, uses, and nutritional values. Arborio Rice is a short-grain rice variety
  typically used in Italian dishes like risotto, while White Rice is a generic term
  that refers to any rice with the husk, bran, and germ removed, resulting in a white
  kernel. Merging them would not accurately represent their differences.
