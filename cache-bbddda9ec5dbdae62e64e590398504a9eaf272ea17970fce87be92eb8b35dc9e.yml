text: No, the instances 'Pork Cutlet' and 'Pork Sausage' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both derived from pork, they have
  distinct culinary preparations and characteristics. A pork cutlet typically consists
  of a thin, breaded and fried piece of pork, while a pork sausage is made from ground
  pork and various seasonings, often formed into a cylindrical shape and cooked. These
  differences in preparation and presentation warrant separate instances.
