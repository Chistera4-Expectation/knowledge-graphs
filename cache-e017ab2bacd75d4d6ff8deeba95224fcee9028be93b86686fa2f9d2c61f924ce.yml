text: No, Canola Oil and Soybean Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they are derived from
  different plants and have distinct nutritional profiles. Canola Oil is extracted
  from the seeds of the canola plant (a variety of rapeseed), while Soybean Oil is
  extracted from soybeans. These differences in source material lead to variations
  in their chemical compositions, such as fatty acid profiles and vitamin content,
  making them unique entities in a dietary context.
