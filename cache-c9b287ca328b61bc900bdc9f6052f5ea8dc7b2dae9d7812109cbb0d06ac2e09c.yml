text: ' No. Organic Clover Honey and Tupelo Honey are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they both fall under the category of honey. They have distinct
  differences in terms of their source (floral type), taste, color, texture, and sometimes
  cost. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entities with unique
  characteristics and properties.'
