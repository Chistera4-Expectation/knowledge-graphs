  While both concepts are related to butter, they serve different purposes and contain
  distinct information. The "Butter" class refers to a general category of food items
  made from churned cream or milk, while `is_healthier_than(other_butter)` is a method
  that compares the nutritional values of two specific instances of butter. These
  concepts should not be merged because they represent unique aspects of the domain
  knowledge about butter and its properties.'
