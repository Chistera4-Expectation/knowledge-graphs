  While both "Milk" and `pasteurization_method` are related to dairy products, they
  represent different concepts and serve distinct purposes. "Milk" refers to the general
  category of dairy product derived from mammals, while `pasteurization_method` provides
  information about a specific treatment applied to that milk for safety reasons.
  Merging them would not accurately reflect their separate roles within the context
  of nutrition and food science.'
