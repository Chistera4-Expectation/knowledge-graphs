  Caraway seeds and quinoa seeds are two different types of edible seeds with distinct
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Caraway seeds have a stronger flavor and
  are commonly used in European and Middle Eastern cuisine, while quinoa seeds are
  known for their protein content and are often used in gluten-free dishes. They should
  not be considered semantic and ontological duplicates.'
