text: ' No. Grape seeds and sunflower seeds are distinct types of seeds that have
  different nutritional profiles and uses. Therefore, they should not be merged as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. While both can be considered "edible seeds,"
  they belong to separate categories based on their unique characteristics and properties.'
