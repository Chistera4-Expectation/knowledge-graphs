text: ' No. Cherries and strawberries are distinct types of fruit with their own unique
  characteristics and should not be merged as semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they may both fall under the broader category of "edible fruits," they have
  different nutritional profiles, physical properties, growth habits, and uses in
  cooking and food preparation. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate categories
  for these two types of fruit to accurately reflect their differences and provide
  appropriate information about them.'
