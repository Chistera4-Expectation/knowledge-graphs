  While both "Chili butter" and "Herb butter" are types of flavored butters, they
  have different ingredients and uses in cooking, making them distinct entities. Chili
  butter typically contains chili peppers or hot sauce and is used to add spicy flavor
  to dishes, while herb butter is made with softened butter mixed with minced fresh
  herbs like parsley, basil, or thyme, and is often used to enhance the flavor of
  grilled meats, fish, or vegetables. From a culinary perspective, these two butters
  serve different purposes and can''t be considered duplicates.'
