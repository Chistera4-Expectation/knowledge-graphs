text: No, they should not be merged. Blue Cheese and Parmesan Cheese are distinct
  types of cheese with unique characteristics, flavors, and textures. They can be
  classified under the broader category of cheese, but they should not be merged as
  duplicates, as they represent different cheese varieties.
