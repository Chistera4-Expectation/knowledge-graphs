text: No, Artisanal Water and Flavored Water should not be merged together as they
  have distinct characteristics. Artisanal Water refers to water sourced from natural
  springs or wells, while Flavored Water is regular drinking water infused with natural
  or artificial flavors. Although both fall under the category of drinking water,
  they have different properties and purposes.
