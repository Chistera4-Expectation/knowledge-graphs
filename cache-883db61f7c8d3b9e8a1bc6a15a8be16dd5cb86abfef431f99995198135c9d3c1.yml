  While both Chicken tacos and Turkey are types of poultry, they cannot be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer to different dishes with
  distinct ingredients and preparation methods. Chicken tacos specifically denote
  a dish made from chicken meat, while "turkey like chicken" refers to the similarities
  between turkey and chicken meat in terms of their culinary uses but does not represent
  a specific dish.'
