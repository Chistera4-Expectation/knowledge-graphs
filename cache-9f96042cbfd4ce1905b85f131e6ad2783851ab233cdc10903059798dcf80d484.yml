text: No, "Chicken Tenders" and "Chicken" should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are derived from poultry, they are different food items with
  distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and preparation methods. Chicken
  Tenders are a specific cut of chicken meat, typically from the breast or tenderloin,
  while "Chicken" encompasses the whole bird or various cuts.
