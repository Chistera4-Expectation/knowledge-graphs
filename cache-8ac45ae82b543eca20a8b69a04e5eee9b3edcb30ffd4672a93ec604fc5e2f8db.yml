  Although both "apple seeds" and "chia seeds" are types of seeds, they are not semantic
  nor ontological duplicates because they belong to different categories with distinct
  characteristics, uses, and safety considerations. Apple seeds come from apples and
  contain small amounts of substances that can release cyanide upon digestion; however,
  you would need to consume large quantities for toxicity. Chia seeds, on the other
  hand, originate from Salvia hispanica plants and have various health benefits due
  to their high nutritional content (e.g., fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, antioxidants).
  Merging these two concepts into one category is misleading and incorrect since they
  serve different purposes within a healthy diet.'
