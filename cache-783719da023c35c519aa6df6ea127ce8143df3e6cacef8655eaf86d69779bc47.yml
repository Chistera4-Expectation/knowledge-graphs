text: As a dietician, my answer would be that merging the instances 'Multigrain Bread'
  and 'Rye Bread' as semantic and ontologic duplicates is not appropriate. Although
  they are both types of bread, they have distinct nutritional profiles and ingredients,
  which makes them unique from one another. Merging them would not accurately represent
  the differences in their nutritional content and health benefits.
