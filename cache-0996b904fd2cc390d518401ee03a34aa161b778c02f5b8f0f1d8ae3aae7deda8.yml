  The two instances, "sliced green onions" and "bacon bits, diced vegetables," are
  not identical in their composition or meaning, even though they share some similarities.
  Sliced green onions refer to a specific type of onion that has been cut into thin
  slices, whereas bacon bits, diced vegetables refer to small pieces of cooked bacon
  mixed with other chopped vegetables. They have different flavors, textures, and
  nutritional profiles, making them distinct entities rather than duplicates. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate in the Edible Vegetable class.'
