  While avocado oil and pumpkin seed oil are both edible vegetable oils, they come
  from different plants (avocados and pumpkin seeds, respectively) and have unique
  nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
