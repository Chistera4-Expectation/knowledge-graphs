  While both French dressing and Greek yogurt dressing can be used as toppings for
  salads, they have different ingredients and nutritional profiles, so they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. French dressing is typically made with oil,
  vinegar, and various seasonings, while Greek yogurt dressing is made with yogurt
  (often Greek) and herbs or other flavorings. These differences mean that they cannot
  be considered identical from either a linguistic or an ontological perspective.'
