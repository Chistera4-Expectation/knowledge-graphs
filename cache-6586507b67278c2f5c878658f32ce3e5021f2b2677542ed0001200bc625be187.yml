  While Cajun seasoning and Jamaican jerk seasoning may have some ingredients in common
  (such as garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper), they are distinctly different
  spice blends with unique flavor profiles and origins. Cajun seasoning is associated
  with Creole and Cajun cuisine from Louisiana, USA, while Jamaican jerk seasoning
  has its roots in Jamaica and features warm spices such as allspice and cinnamon
  along with chili peppers for heat. Merging them would not accurately represent their
  separate culinary identities and uses.'
