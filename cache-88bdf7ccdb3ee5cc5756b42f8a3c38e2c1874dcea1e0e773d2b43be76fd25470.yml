text: ' No. While both lobsters and slipper lobsters are types of crustaceans that
  are often consumed by humans, they belong to different taxonomic families: Nephropidae
  for true lobsters (including clawed lobsters like Homarus americanus) and Scyllaridae
  for slipper lobsters (also known as shovelnose lobsters). Therefore, they have distinct
  biological characteristics, behaviors, and ecological roles. Merging them into one
  category would not accurately reflect their unique identities and differences.'
