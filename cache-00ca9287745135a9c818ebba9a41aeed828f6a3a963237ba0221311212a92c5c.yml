text: No, 'Mint Tea' and 'Rooibos Tea' should not be merged together as they are different
  types of teas with distinct flavors and properties. Mint tea is made from mint leaves
  and is often used for its refreshing taste and potential health benefits, while
  Rooibos tea is made from the leaves of the South African rooibos plant and has a
  unique, slightly sweet flavor. They should remain as separate instances in the class.
