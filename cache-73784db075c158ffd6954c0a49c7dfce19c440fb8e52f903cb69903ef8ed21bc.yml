text: ' No, apple seeds and hemp seeds should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both are types of seeds, they come from different
  plants (apples and hemp, respectively) and have different nutritional profiles and
  uses. Therefore, it is important to keep them separate and distinct in a classification
  system for edible seeds.'
