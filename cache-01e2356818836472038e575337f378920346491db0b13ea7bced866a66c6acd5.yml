  Extra virgin olive oil and sunflower oil are both types of edible vegetable oils,
  but they have different properties and uses, so they should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Extra virgin olive oil is made from the fruit of the
  olive tree and has a distinctive flavor and aroma. It is high in monounsaturated
  fats and antioxidants and is often used in salad dressings, marinades, and drizzled
  over finished dishes. Sunflower oil, on the other hand, is extracted from the seeds
  of the sunflower plant. It is higher in polyunsaturated fats than extra virgin olive
  oil and has a neutral taste, making it suitable for use in cooking at high temperatures,
  such as frying. Therefore, these two oils serve distinct purposes in the kitchen
  and should not be considered duplicates.'
