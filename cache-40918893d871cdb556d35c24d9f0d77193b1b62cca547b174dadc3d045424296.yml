text: No, these instances should not be merged together. While they both pertain to
  seasonings, they are different in terms of specificity and context. "Additional
  seasonings" is a general term that could refer to any number of seasonings, while
  "Five Spice Powder for additional flavor" refers to a specific seasoning blend (Five
  Spice Powder) used for adding flavor.
