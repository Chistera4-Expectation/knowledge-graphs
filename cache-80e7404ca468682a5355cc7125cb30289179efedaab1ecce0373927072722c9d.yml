text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they
  both fall under the category of butter, they have distinct characteristics and production
  methods. 'Flavored Butter' refers to butter that has added flavors, such as garlic
  or herbs, while 'Grass-fed Butter' refers to butter made from the milk of cows that
  have been fed primarily on grass. These differences make them separate entities
  within the butter class.
