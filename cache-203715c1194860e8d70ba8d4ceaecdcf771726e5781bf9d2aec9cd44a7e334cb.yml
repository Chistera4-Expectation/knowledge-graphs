text: No, they should not be merged as they have different ingredients, preparation
  methods, and uses. Marinara sauce is a tomato-based sauce, while Tempura Dipping
  Sauce is typically a soy sauce-based sauce with added ingredients like mirin and
  dashi. They serve different purposes in cooking and cater to different taste preferences.
