text: No, the instances 'Pecorino Romano cheese' and 'Swiss cheese' should not be
  merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates because they are distinct types of cheeses
  with different origins, flavors, and production methods. They can coexist in the
  same Cheese class without being considered duplicates.
