  While both Chicken Parmesan and Turkey are types of poultry, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Chicken Parmesan is a specific dish made with chicken,
  whereas "turkey - like chicken" refers to the similarity between turkey and chicken
  in terms of their taste and nutritional profile. Merging these two instances would
  result in loss of meaning and accuracy.'
