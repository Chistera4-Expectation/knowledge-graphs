  While both prawns and smoked prawns are types of edible crustaceans, they have distinct
  differences that warrant them being treated as separate entities. Prawns are simply
  freshwater or saltwater crustaceans with a sweet, delicate flavor and firm texture.
  Smoked prawns, on the other hand, refer to prawns that have been cured and slow-cooked
  over smoke, resulting in a different taste and texture compared to their non-smoked
  counterparts. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
