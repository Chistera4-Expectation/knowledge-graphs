text: "As a dietician, my role is to provide information on nutrition and food science,\
  \ not to determine the categorization or labeling of specific food products. However,\
  \ I can provide some insight into the differences between these two types of yogurts.\n\
  \nBulgarian Yogurt and Probiotic Yogurt are not semantic or ontologic duplicates,\
  \ as they have distinct characteristics. \n\nBulgarian Yogurt is a traditional yogurt\
  \ originating from Bulgaria and is made using specific Lactobacillus bulgaricus\
  \ and Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria strains. It is known for its unique tangy\
  \ taste and thick texture.\n\nProbiotic Yogurt, on the other hand, is a general\
  \ term for yogurts containing live and active cultures, including Lactobacillus\
  \ bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, but may also contain other probiotic\
  \ strains, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium. These additional\
  \ strains may provide additional health benefits.\n\nWhile both yogurts contain\
  \ live and active cultures, they may not always be the same in terms of bacterial\
  \ strains and potential health benefits. Therefore, they should not be merged as\
  \ semantic or ontologic duplicates."
