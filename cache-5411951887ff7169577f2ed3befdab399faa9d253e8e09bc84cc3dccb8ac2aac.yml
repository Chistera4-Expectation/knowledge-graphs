  While both "comb honey" and "tupelo honey" are types of honey, they refer to different
  things. Comb honey is honey that still contains the original wax comb built by honeybees,
  while tupelo honey is a type of honey produced from the nectar of tupelo trees,
  which gives it a unique flavor and slower crystallization rate. Therefore, these
  two terms cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
