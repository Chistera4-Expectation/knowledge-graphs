text: ' No. Flaxseed oil and palm oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They come from different types of plants (flax
  vs. palm), have different nutritional profiles, and are used for different culinary
  purposes. Therefore, it is important to keep them separate in a classification system
  like an edible vegetable oil class.'
