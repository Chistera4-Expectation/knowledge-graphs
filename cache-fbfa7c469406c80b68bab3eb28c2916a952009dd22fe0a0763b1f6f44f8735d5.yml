text: No, they should not be merged together as they have distinct differences in
  their composition and properties. Distilled water is water that has been boiled
  and then condensed back into liquid form, leaving behind impurities, while well
  water is groundwater that has been extracted from a well and may contain various
  minerals, dissolved solids, and other natural contaminants.
