text: ' Sure, I can provide some examples of different types or "instances" that could
  be part of a class called "Rice." Here are a few:


  1. White rice - This is the most commonly consumed type of rice in the United States
  and is often enriched with vitamins like niacin, thiamine, and iron. It has had
  its bran and germ removed, which makes it less nutritious than brown rice but also
  faster to cook and easier to digest.

  2. Brown rice - This variety still has the bran and germ intact, so it retains more
  fiber, protein, and other nutrients than white rice. However, it takes longer to
  cook and may not agree with everyone''s digestive system as well as white rice does.

  3. Jasmine rice - A long-grain fragrant rice from Thailand, jasmine rice has a slightly
  sweet flavor and aroma. It''s usually sold as a white rice, though there are also
  whole grain versions available.

  4. Basmati rice - Another long-grain fragrant rice, basmati comes from India and
  Pakistan. It''s known for its delicate, nutty flavor and firm texture when cooked.
  Like jasmine rice, it''s typically sold as a white rice.

  5. Arborio rice - Short-grained Italian rice used for making risotto, arborio has
  a high starch content that helps create the creamy consistency of this classic dish.

  6. Black rice - Also known as purple rice or forbidden rice, black rice gets its
  color from anthocyanins, antioxidant pigments found in berries and other fruits.
  It has a rich, earthy flavor and is higher in fiber and protein than many other
  rices.

  7. Wild rice - Technically a grass rather than a true rice, wild rice is native
  to North America and has a distinctive smoky, nutty taste. It''s also quite expensive
  compared to other rices due to its labor-intensive harvesting process.'
