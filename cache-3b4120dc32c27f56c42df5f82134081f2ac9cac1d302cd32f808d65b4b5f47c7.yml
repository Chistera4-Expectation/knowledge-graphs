text: ' No. Sashimi-grade fish and swordfish are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  although they do share some characteristics related to being consumed as edible
  fish. Sashimi-grade refers to the quality and freshness of any type of fish that
  is suitable for eating raw, while swordfish is a specific species of fish. Therefore,
  these two instances represent different concepts within the Edible Fish class.'
