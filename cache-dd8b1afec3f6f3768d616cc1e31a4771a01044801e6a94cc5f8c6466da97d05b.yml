text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties and uses. Extra Virgin
  Olive Oil is derived from olives and is commonly used in Mediterranean cuisine,
  while Macadamia Nut Oil is derived from macadamia nuts and has a higher smoke point,
  making it suitable for high-heat cooking methods. They have different nutritional
  profiles and are used in different culinary applications.
