text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct sauces with different ingredients
  and flavor profiles. Aioli sauce is typically made with garlic, olive oil, and lemon
  juice, while Scotch bonnet pepper sauce is made with Scotch bonnet peppers and other
  ingredients to create a spicy sauce. These sauces have unique properties and would
  not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.
