text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both instances are used for
  seasoning, they serve different purposes and have distinct flavors. Red pepper flakes
  are used to add heat or spiciness, while soy sauce is used for its salty and umami
  taste. Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and potentially confuse
  users.
