text: No, Grapeseed Oil and Pistachio Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct properties, nutritional values, and uses in cooking and other applications.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each oil.
