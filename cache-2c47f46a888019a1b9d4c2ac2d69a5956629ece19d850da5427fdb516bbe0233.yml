text: No, Almond Oil and Flaxseed Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they both fall under the category of edible vegetal oils, they
  have different nutritional profiles, uses, and properties. Merging them would lead
  to inaccuracies and confusion in the classification system.
