text: As a dietician, I would recommend not merging the instances 'Hemp Seeds' and
  'Seeds' as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Hemp Seeds' is a specific
  type of seed, while 'Seeds' is a general term that includes a wide range of seeds,
  including hemp seeds. They are related but not identical.
