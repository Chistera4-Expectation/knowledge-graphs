text: No, Rice Bran Oil and Walnut Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties,
  flavors, and nutritional profiles. Rice Bran Oil is high in unsaturated fats and
  has a mild flavor, while Walnut Oil is high in polyunsaturated fats and has a nutty
  flavor. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
