text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from ostriches,
  they are distinct food items with different nutritional profiles and cooking methods.
  Ostrich eggs are a source of protein and other nutrients, while ostrich thighs are
  a leaner, lower-fat alternative to other types of poultry meat. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the distinct characteristics of each food item.
