text: No, "Ostrich Soup" and "Ostrich Thighs" should not be merged together as they
  represent different food preparations. Ostrich Soup refers to a soup made with ostrich
  meat as the primary ingredient, while Ostrich Thighs refer to the actual thigh portion
  of the ostrich meat. They are related but distinct concepts in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
