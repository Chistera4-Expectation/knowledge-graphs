text: ' No. Idli rice, which is also known as parboiled rice, and short-grain rice
  are not semantic and ontological duplicates and should not be merged together. They
  have distinct differences in terms of their properties, uses, and nutritional content.
  Here are some reasons why they should not be merged:


  1. Properties: Idli rice undergoes a process called parboiling before it is milled,
  which helps to retain more vitamins and minerals compared to regular raw rice. Short-grain
  rice has a higher starch content than long-grain rice varieties, making it stickier
  when cooked. These differences in processing and composition result in different
  textures, flavors, and culinary applications for each type of rice.

  2. Uses: Idli rice is commonly used to make idlis, steamed cakes that are popular
  in South Indian cuisine. Its unique texture makes it ideal for this purpose. On
  the other hand, short-grain rice is often used in dishes like sushi, risotto, and
  paella due to its ability to become creamy and sticky when cooked. Merging these
  two types of rice would overlook their specific use cases.

  3. Nutrition: Although both types of rice provide carbohydrates, there are differences
  in their nutrient profiles due to factors such as processing methods and cultivar
  characteristics. For example, parboiled rice retains more B vitamins and fiber compared
  to non-parboiled rice. Meanwhile, short-grain rice may contain slightly different
  ratios of macronutrients depending on the variety and growing conditions. Keeping
  them separate allows consumers to choose based on their individual dietary needs
  and preferences.'
