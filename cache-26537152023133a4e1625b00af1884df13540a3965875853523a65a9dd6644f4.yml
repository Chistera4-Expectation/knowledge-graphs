text: As a dietician, my focus is primarily on the nutritional content and health
  aspects of food, rather than the technical aspects of ontology. However, from a
  purely semantic perspective, 'Satay sauce' and 'sour sauce' are not exact duplicates.
  While both sauces might have some similarities, they have distinct flavors and ingredients.
  Therefore, I would say no, they should not be merged as duplicates.
