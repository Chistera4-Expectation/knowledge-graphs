text: ' No. While both raw fish and swordfish are types of edible fish, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. Raw fish is a general term that refers to any
  fish that has not been cooked, while swordfish is a specific type of fish. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
