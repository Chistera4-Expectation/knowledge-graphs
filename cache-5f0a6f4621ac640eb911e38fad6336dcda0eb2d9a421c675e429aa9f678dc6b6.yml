text: ' No. While both "Protein source" and "Protein" are related to each other, they
  do not represent duplicate concepts. A protein source refers to food that contains
  protein, while protein is a type of nutrient found within those foods. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
