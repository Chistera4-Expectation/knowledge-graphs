text: No, Mitten Crab and Rock Crab should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they are both edible crustaceans, they belong to different
  species and have distinct characteristics, habitats, and culinary uses. Merging
  them would not accurately represent their unique properties and differences.
