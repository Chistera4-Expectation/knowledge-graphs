text: No, Hibiscus Tea and Lavender Tea are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  Although they are both types of tea, they are made from different plants and have
  distinct flavors, nutritional profiles, and potential health benefits. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each type of tea.
