text: ' No, Grapefruit and Jackfruit should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of fruits with different nutritional profiles and characteristics. While both
  are edible fruits, they belong to different botanical families and have unique tastes,
  textures, and uses. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate categories
  for accurate identification and nutrition analysis purposes.'
