text: No, "Pheasant Sausage" and "Pheasant Tenders" should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from poultry (pheasant), they
  are distinct food items with different preparations, ingredients, and nutritional
  profiles. Pheasant sausage is a processed meat product made from ground pheasant,
  while pheasant tenders are a cut of meat, typically from the breast, and are less
  processed. They should be treated as separate entities within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
