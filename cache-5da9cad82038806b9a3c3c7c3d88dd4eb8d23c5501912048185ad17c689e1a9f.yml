  While both "chicken wings" and "low-sodium chicken broth" are derived from poultry,
  they serve different nutritional purposes and can have varying impacts on one''s
  diet. Chicken wings primarily consist of protein and fat with skin on, while low-sodium
  chicken broth is mainly liquid with reduced sodium content, making it a better option
  for those monitoring their salt intake. Therefore, merging them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates would not accurately reflect their distinct roles within
  a poultry-derived food class.'
