text: No, they should not be merged. While both 'Hard Water' and 'Spring Water' are
  types of drinking water, they have distinct characteristics. Hard water contains
  high levels of minerals such as calcium and magnesium, whereas spring water is sourced
  from underground springs and is generally low in minerals. These differences in
  composition and origin make them separate entities in the context of drinking water
  classification.
