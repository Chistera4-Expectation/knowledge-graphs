text: ' No. While black beans and cannellini beans are both types of legumes that
  can be classified under the broader category of "vegetables," they have distinct
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses, so they should not be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions
  between these two related but unique food items.'
