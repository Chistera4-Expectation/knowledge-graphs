text: No, they should not be merged. Although they both fall under the category of
  sauces, they are distinct types of sauces with different ingredients, flavors, and
  uses. Aioli sauce is typically made from garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice, while
  Tempura Dipping Sauce is a mix of soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and dashi stock. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each sauce.
