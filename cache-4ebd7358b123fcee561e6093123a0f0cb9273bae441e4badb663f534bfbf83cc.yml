text: No, the instances 'Hedgehog Mushroom' and 'Maitake Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, appearances, and nutritional
  profiles. Hedgehog mushrooms belong to the Hydnum species, while Maitake mushrooms
  belong to the Grifola species. Merging them as duplicates would be incorrect and
  misleading.
