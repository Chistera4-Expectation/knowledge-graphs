text: No, Sushi Rice and White Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both types of rice, they have distinct characteristics
  and uses in cooking. Sushi Rice is typically short-grain rice that is seasoned with
  a vinegar mixture, making it sticky and perfect for sushi rolls. White Rice, on
  the other hand, is a generic term for any rice that has had its husk, bran, and
  germ removed, resulting in a white color. It can be of various grain lengths and
  is used in a wide range of dishes.
