  While both "grilled chicken" and "low-sodium chicken broth" are poultry-derived
  foods, they serve different purposes and have distinct nutritional profiles. Grilled
  chicken is a whole piece of chicken that has been cooked on a grill, providing protein,
  vitamins, and minerals based on its cut (breast, thigh, etc.). On the other hand,
  low-sodium chicken broth is primarily liquid made from simmering chicken bones,
  vegetables, herbs, and spices with reduced sodium content. Merging them would not
  accurately represent their unique properties and uses in meal planning.'
