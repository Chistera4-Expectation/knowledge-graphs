  While both maitake and shiitake mushrooms belong to the same genus (Grifola) and
  share some similarities in terms of their nutritional profiles and culinary uses,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics and flavors. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
