text: ' No. Asian Sesame Dressing and Russian Dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. They are two distinct types of dressings with different ingredients
  and cultural origins. While they may both contain some form of oil and vinegar,
  their flavor profiles and additional ingredients vary significantly. Therefore,
  they should not be merged together in a food classification system.'
