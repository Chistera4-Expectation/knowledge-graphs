text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both ostrich wings and quail wings are derived from poultry and are classified as
  poultry-derived food, they are distinct types of poultry and have different nutritional
  profiles, culinary uses, and cultural significance. Merging them would result in
  a loss of important information and distinctions.
