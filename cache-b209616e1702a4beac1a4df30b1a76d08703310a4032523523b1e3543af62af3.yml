  While ground beef is a type of ground meat, not all ground meat is necessarily beef.
  Ground meat can also refer to other types of meats such as pork, chicken, turkey,
  etc. Therefore, it is important to keep these two terms separate to accurately describe
  the specific food item being referred to.'
