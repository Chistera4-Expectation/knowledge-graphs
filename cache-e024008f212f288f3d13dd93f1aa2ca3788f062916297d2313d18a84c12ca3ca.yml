text: No, 'Onions' and 'Sliced onions' should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they both refer to the same type of vegetable, they
  represent different stages of preparation. 'Onions' would refer to the vegetable
  in its whole, uncut form, while 'Sliced onions' refers to onions that have been
  cut into slices. They are distinct instances and should be treated as such in a
  dietician's classification system.
