text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of juice, they are distinct
  in terms of the fruit or vegetable they are made from. Peach juice is made from
  peaches, while vegetable juice can be made from a variety of vegetables. Merging
  them would result in a loss of specificity and potentially lead to confusion.
