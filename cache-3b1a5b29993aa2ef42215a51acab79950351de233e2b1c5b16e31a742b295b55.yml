  While both cooked white rice and sushi rice are types of prepared rice made from
  white rice grains, they have different culinary uses and preparation methods that
  warrant them to be treated as separate entities rather than merging them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Cooked white rice is typically boiled or steamed with
  water until it reaches a fluffy consistency, used as a base for various dishes such
  as stir-fries, curries, or served alongside proteins and vegetables. Sushi rice,
  on the other hand, undergoes a specific vinegar seasoning process called "su" after
  being cooked, resulting in its unique taste and sticky texture tailored specifically
  for making traditional Japanese sushi rolls and nigiri. Due to these distinct differences
  in their application and production processes, I would not merge cooked white rice
  and sushi rice as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
