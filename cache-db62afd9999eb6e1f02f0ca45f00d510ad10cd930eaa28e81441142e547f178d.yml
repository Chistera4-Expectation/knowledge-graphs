text: No, Enoki mushrooms and Shiitake mushrooms should not be merged together as
  they are different types of edible mushrooms with distinct characteristics, nutritional
  profiles, and culinary uses. While both are edible and belong to the same class,
  they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
