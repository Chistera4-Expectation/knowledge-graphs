  Fennel seeds and pumpkin seeds are two different seeds with their own unique nutritional
  profiles. While they are both seeds, they belong to different genera and species,
  which results in different chemical compositions and health benefits. Therefore,
  they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
