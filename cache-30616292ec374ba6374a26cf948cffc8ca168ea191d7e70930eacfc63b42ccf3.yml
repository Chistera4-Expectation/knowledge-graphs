text: ' No. While peanut oil and sesame oil are both edible vegetable oils, they come
  from different plant sources (peanuts vs. sesame seeds) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
