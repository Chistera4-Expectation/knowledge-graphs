text: No, Argan oil and cooking oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While Argan oil is a type of cooking oil, it has unique
  properties and uses that set it apart from other cooking oils. Argan oil is derived
  from the kernels of the argan tree and is known for its high nutritional value,
  as well as its use in cosmetics. In contrast, cooking oil is a broader term that
  encompasses various types of oils used for cooking purposes, such as vegetable oil,
  olive oil, and canola oil. Merging these two instances would not accurately represent
  their distinct characteristics and applications.
