text: ' No. Fresh mozzarella cheese and Pecorino Romano cheese are not semantic and
  ontological duplicates and should not be merged together. These two types of cheeses
  have distinct characteristics, such as taste, texture, production process, and animal
  milk source (cow for fresh mozzarella and sheep for Pecorino Romano). Therefore,
  they belong to separate categories within the cheese class.'
