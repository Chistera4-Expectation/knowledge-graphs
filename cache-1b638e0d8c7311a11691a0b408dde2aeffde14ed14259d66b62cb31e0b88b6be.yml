  While both Cherry Blossom honey and Eucalyptus honey fall under the category of
  "honey," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they come from
  different botanical sources (cherry blossoms vs eucalyptus) and have distinct flavor
  profiles and properties. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate
  entities with their unique characteristics.'
