text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  "Quail Nuggets" and "Quail" involve quail meat, they are different food items with
  distinct preparation methods and potentially different nutritional profiles. "Quail
  Nuggets" likely refers to a processed food item made from quail meat, while "Quail"
  simply refers to the meat itself. Merging them would result in a loss of information
  and specificity.
