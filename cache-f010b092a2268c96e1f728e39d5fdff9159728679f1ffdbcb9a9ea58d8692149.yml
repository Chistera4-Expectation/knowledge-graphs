text: No, they should not be merged. While both Cayenne Pepper and Pepper can be used
  as seasonings, they are different types of peppers with distinct flavors and uses.
  Cayenne Pepper is a type of chili pepper known for its spicy heat, while Pepper
  (black, white, or green) is derived from the fruit of the Piper nigrum plant and
  is known for its more earthy, aromatic flavor. Merging them as duplicates would
  not accurately represent their unique properties in a culinary context.
