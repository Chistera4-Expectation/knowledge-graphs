text: No, they should not be merged. Although they both refer to milk from cows, "Cow's
  Milk" and "Whole Milk" are not the same. "Cow's Milk" is a general term that refers
  to milk from cows, while "Whole Milk" refers to a specific type of cow's milk that
  has not been skimmed and contains all the fat from the milk. These are two distinct
  entities in the context of a milk classification system.
