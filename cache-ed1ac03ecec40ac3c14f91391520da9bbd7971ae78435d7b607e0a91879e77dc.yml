  Olive oil and Safflower oil are different oils with distinct nutritional profiles
  and culinary uses. While they are both vegetable oils, they have different fatty
  acid compositions, caloric values, and health benefits. Therefore, they should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
