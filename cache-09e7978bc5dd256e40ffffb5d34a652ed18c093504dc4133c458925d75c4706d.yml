text: No, the instances 'Rock Crab' and 'Sand Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both crustaceans, they belong
  to different species and have different characteristics and habitats. Merging them
  would lead to inaccurate information and confusion.
