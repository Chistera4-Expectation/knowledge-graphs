text: No, they should not be merged together. While both chili and other chili pepper
  can be considered as types of chili peppers, they can also be differentiated based
  on their specific variety, size, shape, heat level, and other characteristics. Merging
  them together would not accurately represent these differences in the Edible Vegetable
  class.
