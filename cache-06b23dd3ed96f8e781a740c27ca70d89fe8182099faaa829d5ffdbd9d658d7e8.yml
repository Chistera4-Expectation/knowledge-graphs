text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  they both come from the same animal, guinea fowl, they have different forms and
  preparations. Guinea Fowl Meat refers to the raw, unprocessed meat, while Guinea
  Fowl Nuggets are processed and shaped into bite-sized pieces. Therefore, they are
  distinct instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
