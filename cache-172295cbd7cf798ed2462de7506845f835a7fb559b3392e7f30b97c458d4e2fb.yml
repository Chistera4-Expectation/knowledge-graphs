text: No, coconut water and tap water should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are types of water, they have different properties,
  nutritional values, and intended uses. Coconut water contains nutrients and electrolytes,
  while tap water is typically treated for drinking purposes and may vary in mineral
  content depending on the source.
