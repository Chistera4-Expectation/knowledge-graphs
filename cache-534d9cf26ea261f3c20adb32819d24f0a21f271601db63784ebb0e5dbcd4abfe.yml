text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from poultry,
  they are different food items with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses.
  Chicken feet are a source of collagen, while chicken patties are a processed form
  of ground chicken meat. Therefore, they should be considered separate entities in
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
