text: No, 'Carrot juice' and 'Mango juice' should not be merged as they are distinct
  types of juices made from different fruits or vegetables. Although they may both
  be categorized as juices, they have unique nutritional profiles and properties,
  making them separate entities in the context of a dietician's work.
