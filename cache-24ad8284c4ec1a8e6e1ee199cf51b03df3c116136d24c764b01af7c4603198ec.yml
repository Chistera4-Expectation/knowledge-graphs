  ''Instances of the Sauce class'' and ''Red sauce'' are not semantic and ontologic
  duplicates because they represent different concepts.


  * **Instances of the Sauce class** is a group of objects that are instances of the
  Sauce class. This concept is related to the class definition and its instantiation.

  * **Red sauce** is a specific type of sauce, which is one of many possible types
  of sauce. This concept is related to the domain of sauces and their various classifications.


  Therefore, although they are both related to the concept of sauce, they represent
  different ontological categories.'
