text: No, Beet juice and Carrot juice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates, as they are distinct types of juices made from different ingredients
  with unique nutritional profiles. While they might share some common properties,
  they are not the same thing and should be treated as separate instances in a juice
  class.
