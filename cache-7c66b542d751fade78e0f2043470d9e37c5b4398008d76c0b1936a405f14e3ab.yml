  They are two distinct types of yogurt with different flavors and uses. Fruit-flavored
  yogurt typically has sweet flavors and is often consumed as a dessert or snack,
  while savory yogurt has more savory flavors and is often used as a condiment or
  ingredient in savory dishes. Although they both belong to the yogurt class, they
  have unique characteristics that differentiate them.
