text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of yogurt with
  distinct characteristics. Bulgarian Yogurt is typically made with specific bacteria
  and has a unique taste, while Fat-Free Yogurt refers to yogurt with little to no
  fat content. These are not semantic or ontologic duplicates as they have distinct
  features.
