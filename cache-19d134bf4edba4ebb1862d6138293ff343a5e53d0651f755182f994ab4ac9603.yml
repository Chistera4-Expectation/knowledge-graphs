text: ' No, black beans and green beans should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of foods with different nutritional profiles. While both are considered
  vegetables and can be part of a healthy diet, they belong to different botanical
  families and have unique characteristics. Black beans are legumes, while green beans
  are technically fruits but are commonly classified as vegetables. They also differ
  in their nutrient content, with black beans being higher in fiber, protein, and
  certain minerals such as iron and magnesium, whereas green beans contain more vitamin
  C and K. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entities in a dietary
  context.'
