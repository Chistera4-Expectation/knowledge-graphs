text: ' No. Barbecue sauce and dark soy sauce are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. They have different ingredients, flavors,
  uses, and cultural origins. Barbecue sauce is typically made with tomatoes, vinegar,
  sugar, and various spices, while dark soy sauce is a type of soy sauce that has
  been aged longer than light soy sauce, giving it a thicker consistency and richer
  flavor due to its higher concentration of caramelized sugars and amino acids from
  fermented soybeans. Merging them would result in loss of specificity and confusion
  for users looking for information on these distinct sauces.'
