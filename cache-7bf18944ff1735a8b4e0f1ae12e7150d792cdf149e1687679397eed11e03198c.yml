  The reason is that "Arborio rice" refers to a specific type of rice, whereas "rice
  flour" refers to a product made from ground rice grains. While they share some similarities
  in terms of their nutritional content, they have different textures and uses in
  cooking. Therefore, it makes sense to keep them separate rather than merging them
  into a single instance.'
