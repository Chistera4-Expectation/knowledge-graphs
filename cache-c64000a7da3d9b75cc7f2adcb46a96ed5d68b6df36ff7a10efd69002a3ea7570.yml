  Cajun seasoning is a specific type of seasoning blend with its own unique ingredients
  and flavor profile, while "optional seasonings" refers to any additional seasonings
  that can be added according to personal preference. Therefore, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates but rather different categories of food seasonings.'
