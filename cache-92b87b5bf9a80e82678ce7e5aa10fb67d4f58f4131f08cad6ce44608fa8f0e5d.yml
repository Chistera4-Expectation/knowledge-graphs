text: As a dietician, I would say that "Yellow onion" can be considered a subclass
  or type of "Onion" since it is a specific variety of onion. However, in terms of
  the programming and ontology perspective, they can be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates since they both represent the same type of food. The decision ultimately
  depends on the purpose and context of the classification system.
