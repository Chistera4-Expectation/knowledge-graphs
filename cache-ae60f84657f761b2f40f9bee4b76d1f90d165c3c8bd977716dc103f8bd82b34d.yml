  While canola oil and palm oil are both vegetable oils that have their own unique
  nutritional profiles and uses, they cannot be considered semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They come from different plant sources (canola oil is derived from rapeseed
  plants while palm oil comes from the fruit of oil palms), have distinct compositions,
  and possess varying health benefits or drawbacks. Therefore, it is important to
  maintain separate categories for these two types of edible vegetal oils.'
