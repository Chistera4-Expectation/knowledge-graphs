text: No, Snow Crab and Stone Crab should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are edible crustaceans, they belong to different genera and
  have distinct characteristics, flavors, and culinary uses. Snow Crabs are from the
  genus Chionoecetes, while Stone Crabs are from the genus Menippe. Merging them would
  not accurately represent their unique properties and classifications.
