text: No, 'Duck Stock' and 'Ostrich Stock' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both poultry-derived stocks, they come from different
  types of poultry and may have different nutritional profiles, taste, and uses in
  recipes. Therefore, they should be considered as distinct instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
