text: No, "Camel Milk" and "Nut Milk" should not be merged together as they are different
  types of milk with distinct nutritional profiles and properties. Camel Milk is an
  animal-based milk, while Nut Milk refers to a variety of plant-based milk alternatives
  made from nuts such as almonds, cashews, or hazelnuts. Merging them would not accurately
  represent their differences in dietetics and nutrition.
