text: ' "Plant-Based Proteins" or "Meat Substitutes (from Plant Sources)" would be
  suitable class names for plant-based meat alternatives, encompassing options like
  tofu, tempeh, textured vegetable protein (TVP), soy burgers, and other similar products.
  These terms clearly indicate that the foods in this category are derived from plants
  rather than animals, making it easier for consumers to identify them as viable alternatives
  to beef, pork, and poultry.'
