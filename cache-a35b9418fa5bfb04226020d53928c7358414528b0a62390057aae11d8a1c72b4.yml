text: ' No. Blackberry honey is a specific type of honey that is made from the nectar
  of blackberry flowers, while honey can refer to any sweet substance produced by
  bees from the nectar of flowers. Therefore, these two terms are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates and should not be merged.'
