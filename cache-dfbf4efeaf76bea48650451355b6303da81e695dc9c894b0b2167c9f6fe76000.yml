text: No, the instances 'Chanterelle Mushroom' and 'Oyster Mushroom' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong
  to the Edible Mushrooms class, they are distinct species with different characteristics,
  nutritional values, and culinary uses. Merging them together would lead to a loss
  of specific information and would not accurately represent the individual species.
