text: No, the instances 'Bean sprouts' and 'Red Beans' should not be merged together
  as they are distinct types of beans with different nutritional and culinary properties.
  Bean sprouts are young sprouted beans, often used in salads or stir-fries, while
  red beans are fully-grown beans, commonly used in stews, soups, or rice dishes.
