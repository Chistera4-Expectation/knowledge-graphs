text: 'No, the instances ''Sesame Seeds'' and ''Sesame paste'' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are related, they are
  different entities: ''Sesame Seeds'' refers to the raw, edible seeds, while ''Sesame
  paste'' is a processed product made from ground sesame seeds. Merging them would
  cause confusion and incorrect categorization in the Edible Seeds class.'
