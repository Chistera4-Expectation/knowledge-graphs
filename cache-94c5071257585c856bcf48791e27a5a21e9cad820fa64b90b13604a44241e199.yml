text: As a dietician, I would advise against merging 'Pork Schnitzel' and 'Pork' as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from pork, they represent
  different types of food products. Pork Schnitzel is a specific dish made from pork,
  while 'Pork' refers to the general category of meat derived from pigs. They serve
  different purposes in a diet and have distinct nutritional profiles, so it's essential
  to keep them separate in a food classification system.
