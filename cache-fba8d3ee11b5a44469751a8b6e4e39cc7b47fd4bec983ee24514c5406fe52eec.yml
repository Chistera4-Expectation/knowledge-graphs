text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates because "Duck
  Gravy" and "Duck Patties" are two distinct food items made from duck. Duck Gravy
  is a liquid sauce made from duck stock, while Duck Patties are formed patties made
  from ground duck meat. Although they both come from the same source, they serve
  different purposes and have different properties.
