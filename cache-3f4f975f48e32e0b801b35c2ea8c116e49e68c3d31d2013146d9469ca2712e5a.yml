  Although chia seeds and fenugreek seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and health benefits. Therefore, it
  is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. By maintaining
  separate instances for each type of seed, we can accurately represent their unique
  properties and provide more precise information about each one.'
