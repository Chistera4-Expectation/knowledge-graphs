text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  they are both types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics. Australian Yogurt
  might refer to a specific brand or a style of yogurt from Australia, while Creamy
  Yogurt refers to a texture and may apply to different types of yogurts. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the variety of yogurts available.
