  While brown rice is a type of whole grain rice, it has distinct nutritional differences
  compared to other types of rice such as white rice. Merging them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates would not accurately represent their unique properties and
  uses in meal planning and nutrition. It is essential for a dietitian to distinguish
  between various types of rice when providing advice on healthy food choices and
  balanced diets.'
