  While both grass-fed beef and organic beef have certain similarities and may sometimes
  overlap (for example, some farms raise cattle that are both grass-fed and organically
  certified), they refer to different aspects of how the animals were raised and what
  they were fed. Grass-fed beef refers specifically to cows that eat primarily grass
  throughout their lives, while organic beef has stricter guidelines covering not
  just feeding practices but also animal welfare, use of antibiotics and hormones,
  environmental impact, and other factors. Merging them would lose this specificity
  and create confusion about the exact meaning of each term.'
