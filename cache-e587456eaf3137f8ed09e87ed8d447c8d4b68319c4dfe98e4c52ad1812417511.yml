text: 'No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of yogurt:
  Lassi Yogurt is a dairy-based yogurt drink from South Asia, while Non-Dairy Yogurt
  is made from plant-based ingredients and does not contain any dairy products. Although
  they share the commonality of being yogurt, they have distinct characteristics and
  should be treated as separate instances.'
