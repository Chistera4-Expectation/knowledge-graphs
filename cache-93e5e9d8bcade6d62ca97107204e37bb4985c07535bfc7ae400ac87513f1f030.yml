text: No, "Creamy Yogurt" and "Kefir Yogurt" should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics
  and properties. Creamy Yogurt typically refers to a thick, smooth texture, whereas
  Kefir Yogurt is a fermented milk product with a thinner consistency and a tangy
  flavor due to the presence of live probiotic cultures.
