text: ' No. Olive oil dressing and yogurt dressing are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While both may be used as dressings, they have distinct compositional
  differences: olive oil dressing is typically made primarily of olive oil, sometimes
  with added herbs or spices, while yogurt dressing is made primarily of yogurt, often
  with additional ingredients like honey, vinegar, or herbs. Therefore, they represent
  different types of dressings in the culinary domain.'
