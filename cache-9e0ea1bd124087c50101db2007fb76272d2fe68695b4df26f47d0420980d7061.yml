text: ' "Milk" would be the most appropriate class for buttermilk. This is because,
  although it has a thicker and tangier consistency than regular milk, buttermilk
  is still a liquid dairy product that shares many nutritional properties with milk.
  Additionally, buttermilk is made by culturing milk with bacteria, similar to how
  yogurt is made, which further supports its classification as a type of milk. Butters,
  cheeses, and yogurts are all solid or semi-solid dairy products, making them less
  suitable classes for buttermilk.'
