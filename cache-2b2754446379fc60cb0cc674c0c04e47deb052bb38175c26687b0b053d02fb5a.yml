  While both chicken breasts and rotisserie chickens are sources of poultry-derived
  food, they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they
  have distinct characteristics and uses. Chicken breasts refer to specific cuts from
  a chicken that typically contain less fat than other parts of the bird, making them
  popular for lean protein meals. On the other hand, rotisserie chickens are whole
  chickens cooked on a spit, often seasoned with various herbs and spices. Therefore,
  they serve different purposes and cater to diverse culinary needs.'
