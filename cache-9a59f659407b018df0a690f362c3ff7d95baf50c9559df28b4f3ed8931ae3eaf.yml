text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  they both come from the same animal, they have different nutritional profiles and
  are used differently in cooking. Chicken breast is a lean, high-protein cut of meat,
  while chicken broth is a liquid made by simmering the bones and meat of the chicken,
  which contains collagen, minerals, and other nutrients. Merging them as duplicates
  would not accurately represent the differences in their nutritional value and culinary
  uses.
