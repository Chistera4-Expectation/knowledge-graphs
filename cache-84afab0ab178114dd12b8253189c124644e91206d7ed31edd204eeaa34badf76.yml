text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Ostrich Broth' and 'Turkey Broth' are in the Poultry-derived Food class, they are
  not duplicates. They are distinct types of broth made from different types of poultry,
  ostrich and turkey, respectively, and therefore have different properties, nutritional
  values, and uses in cooking.
