text: No, these two instances should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they both involve water, they are distinct in terms of their properties
  and processes. Glacier water is sourced from glaciers and has natural mineral content,
  while oxygenated water is artificially infused with oxygen and has a higher concentration
  of dissolved oxygen compared to regular water. These differences make them distinct
  entities in terms of their characteristics and usage.
