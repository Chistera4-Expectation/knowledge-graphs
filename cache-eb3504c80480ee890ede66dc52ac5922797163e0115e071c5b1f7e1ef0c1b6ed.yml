text: No, these instances should not be merged as they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Chicken Liver is a specific part of the chicken with a distinct nutritional
  profile, while chicken/vegetable stock is a liquid made by simmering chicken and/or
  vegetables in water. Although both are derived from poultry, they serve different
  purposes in a diet and have different nutritional values.
