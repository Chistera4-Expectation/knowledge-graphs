text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  Ostrich Wings and Turkey Wings are poultry-derived food items, they come from different
  bird species with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Thus, they should
  be treated as distinct instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
