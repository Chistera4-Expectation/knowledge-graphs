text: ' It is not accurate to label "Honey" as the most adequate class for ant larvae,
  as they are distinct organisms with different nutritional requirements. Ant larvae
  are typically fed various types of food by their colony, including proteins and
  sugars from sources like insects, seeds, or nectar. Therefore, no single food item
  such as honey can be considered an appropriate classification for ant larvae.'
