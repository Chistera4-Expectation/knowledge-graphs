  While both Chicken Caesar Salad and Turkey may belong to the same general category
  of "Poultry-derived Food," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. A Chicken
  Caesar Salad is a specific dish that includes certain ingredients (including chicken),
  while turkey is a type of poultry meat that can take on various forms (e.g., roasted,
  ground, deli slices). Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two
  instances as duplicates.'
