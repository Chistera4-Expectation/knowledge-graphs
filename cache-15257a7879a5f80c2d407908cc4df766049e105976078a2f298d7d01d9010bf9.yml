  While both chili oil and safflower oil are types of edible oils, they have different
  ingredients, uses, and nutritional profiles. Chili oil is made by infusing vegetable
  oil with chili peppers, while safflower oil is extracted from the seeds of the safflower
  plant. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
