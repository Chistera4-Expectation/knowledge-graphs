text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Red Beans and Red Kidney
  Beans are similar, they are not semantically or ontologically the same. Red Beans
  refer to a type of small, round, red-colored beans, while Red Kidney Beans are a
  specific type of kidney bean with a reddish color. They have different nutritional
  profiles and uses in cuisine. Therefore, they should be kept as separate instances
  in the Edible Vegetable class.
