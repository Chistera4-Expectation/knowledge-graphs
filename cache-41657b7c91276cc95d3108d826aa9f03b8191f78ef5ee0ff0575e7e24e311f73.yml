text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. While both 'Additional seasonings' and
  'Seasonings for filling' may seem similar, they can have different purposes in a
  recipe. 'Additional seasonings' may refer to extra flavorings added to the dish
  after cooking, while 'Seasonings for filling' could refer to specific seasonings
  used in a stuffing or filling for a dish. Merging them together could lead to confusion
  in the context of a recipe.
