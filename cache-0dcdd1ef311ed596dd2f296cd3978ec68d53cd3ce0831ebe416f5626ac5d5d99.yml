text: ' No. While "Pecorino Romano" is a type of cheese and "serving size of the cheese"
  refers to the quantity consumed, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they represent different concepts: one is about a specific kind of cheese,
  while the other describes an amount used for consumption measurement.'
