text: ' No. Mascarpone cheese and shredded mozzarella cheese are not semantic and
  ontological duplicates, even though they are both types of cheese. They have different
  nutritional profiles, textures, flavors, uses in cooking, and cultural origins,
  so it is important to distinguish between them when providing nutrition information
  or making recommendations about their use in a healthy eating pattern.'
