text: No, they should not be merged together. Bean sprouts and mini spring rolls are
  distinct types of edible vegetables. While bean sprouts are a specific type of vegetable,
  mini spring rolls are a type of dish that includes a variety of ingredients, often
  including vegetables. They may both be considered edible vegetables, but they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates.
