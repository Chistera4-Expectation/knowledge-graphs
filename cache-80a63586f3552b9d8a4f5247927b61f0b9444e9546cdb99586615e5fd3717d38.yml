  and ontological duplicates. Although both are types of rice, they have distinct
  properties, flavors, and uses in cooking. Arborio Rice is an Italian short-grain
  rice used for making risotto, while Basmati Rice is a long-grain rice from India
  and Pakistan, known for its aromatic flavor and used in various dishes like biryani
  and pilaf.
