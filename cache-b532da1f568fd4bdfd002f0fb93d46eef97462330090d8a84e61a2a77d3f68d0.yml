text: No, they should not be merged as they are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although they both come from the same source (black pepper), they are different
  forms of the same ingredient. Black peppercorns are the whole dried pepper berries,
  while ground black pepper is the powdered form of black peppercorns. They have different
  uses in cooking and different properties, such as potency and storage life.
