text: ' The most adequate class for emulsifiers would be "Food Additives" or simply
  "Additives," as emulsifiers are often added to food products during processing to
  improve their texture, stability, and shelf life. They don''t fit neatly into the
  categories you provided like Food Dressing, Food Seasoning, Sauce, Spice, or Sweetener.
  Emulsifiers can be found in various food items across these classes but aren''t
  exclusive to any single category.'
