text: "As a dietician, I can provide an informed opinion on the food items, but determining\
  \ the ontological and semantic aspects is not within my expertise. However, I can\
  \ say that 'Lotus Leaf Rice' and 'Lotus Leaf' are not duplicates in the context\
  \ of edible vegetables. \n\n'Lotus Leaf' is a part of the lotus plant (Nelumbo nucifera),\
  \ which is an edible vegetable. It is often used in Asian cuisines, especially in\
  \ Chinese and Japanese dishes. On the other hand, 'Lotus Leaf Rice' is a dish made\
  \ using lotus leaves as a wrapper for rice and other ingredients. While both are\
  \ related to the lotus plant, they are distinct food items. So, the answer is no,\
  \ they should not be merged as duplicates."
