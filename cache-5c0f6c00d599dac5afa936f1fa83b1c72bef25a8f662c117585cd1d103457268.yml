  While both evaporated milk and pasteurization methods are related to dairy products
  and the process of preserving and treating milk, they represent different concepts
  and serve distinct purposes.


  1. Evaporated milk is a type of concentrated milk that has had around 60% of its
  water content removed through evaporation, resulting in a thicker consistency and
  longer shelf life compared to fresh milk. It undergoes pasteurization before being
  canned.

  2. Pasteurization method, on the other hand, refers to the specific technique used
  for heat treatment to eliminate pathogens while maintaining nutritional value in
  milk. Examples include high-temperature short-time (HTST), ultra-high temperature
  (UHT), and low-temperature long-time (LTLT) pasteurizations.


  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as they convey
  unique information about milk processing.'
