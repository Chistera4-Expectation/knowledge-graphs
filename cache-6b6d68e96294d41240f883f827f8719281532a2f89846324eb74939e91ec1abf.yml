text: No, Greek Yogurt and Yogurt should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While they are both types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics and properties.
  Greek yogurt is strained to remove whey, resulting in a thicker, creamier texture
  and a higher protein content than regular yogurt. Regular yogurt typically has a
  thinner consistency and a lower protein content. Therefore, they should be treated
  as separate entities in a yogurt class.
