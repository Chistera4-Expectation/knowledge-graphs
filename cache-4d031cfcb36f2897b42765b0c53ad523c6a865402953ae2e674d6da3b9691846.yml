  Although allspice and allspice berries are related (allspice is made from ground
  allspice berries), they have different culinary uses and may also differ in their
  nutritional content per unit weight. Therefore, it would be appropriate to treat
  them as distinct entities rather than merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
