text: No, the instances 'Hen of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Oyster Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both
  edible mushrooms, they are different species with distinct characteristics, nutritional
  values, and culinary uses. Hen of the Woods Mushroom (Grifola frondosa) is a polypore
  mushroom, while Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) belongs to the oyster mushroom
  family. Keeping them separate allows for accurate identification, nutritional information,
  and cooking recommendations.
