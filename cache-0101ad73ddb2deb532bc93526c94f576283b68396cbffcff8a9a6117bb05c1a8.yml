  While both Acacia honey and Alfalfa honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  botanical origins which can affect their taste, color, and other properties. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.
  It is important to maintain the distinctions between different varieties of honey
  based on their unique characteristics and sources.'
