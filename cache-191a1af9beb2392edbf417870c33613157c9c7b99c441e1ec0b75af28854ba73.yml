text: No, 'Ginger Tea' and 'Mint Tea' are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Although
  they are both types of tea, they have distinct flavors and ingredients, which differentiate
  them from one another. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics
  of each type of tea.
