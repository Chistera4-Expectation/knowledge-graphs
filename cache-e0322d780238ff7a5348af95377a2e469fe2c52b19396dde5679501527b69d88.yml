text: No, "Chicken Meatballs" and "Chicken Patties" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from chicken, they
  are different types of food products with distinct preparation methods and textures.
  Chicken meatballs are typically made by combining ground chicken with various seasonings
  and then shaping the mixture into balls, while chicken patties are made by flattening
  the ground chicken into a patty shape.
