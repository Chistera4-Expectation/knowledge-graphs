text: ' ''Sauce'' would be the most adequate class for an optional dipping sauce.
  This is because sauces are typically used as a condiment to add flavor and moisture
  to food, making them a natural fit for this purpose. Additionally, many of the other
  classes listed (such as "Food Dressing," "Food Seasoning," and "Spice") also involve
  adding flavor or moisture to food, but they tend to have more specific uses than
  a general-purpose dipping sauce.'
