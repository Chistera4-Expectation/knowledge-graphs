  While Heather honey and Orange Blossom honey are both types of honey, they have
  distinct characteristics that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.


  Heather honey is produced primarily from the nectar of heather plants and has a
  strong flavor with a slightly medicinal taste. It also tends to have a darker color
  compared to other honeys. On the other hand, Orange Blossom honey is made from the
  nectar of orange blossoms and has a light citrusy flavor and aroma, along with a
  lighter color.


  Merging these two types of honey into a single category would overlook their unique
  properties and potentially lead to confusion for those seeking out specific flavors
  or benefits associated with each type.'
