text: No, Ground Pork and Pork Shoulder should not be merged as they are different
  types of pork products with distinct properties. Ground Pork refers to ground meat
  from pork, while Pork Shoulder refers to a specific cut of meat from the shoulder
  of the pig. Although both are derived from pork, they have different uses and nutritional
  profiles.
