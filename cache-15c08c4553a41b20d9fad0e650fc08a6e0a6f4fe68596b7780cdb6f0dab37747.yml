  Black rice and rice flour are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They are different
  types of rice products with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Black
  rice is a whole grain rice that is high in fiber, antioxidants, and anthocyanins,
  while rice flour is made by grinding rice into a fine powder and used as a gluten-free
  alternative to wheat flour for baking and thickening purposes. Merging them as duplicates
  would lead to confusion and incorrect information about their unique properties
  and applications.'
