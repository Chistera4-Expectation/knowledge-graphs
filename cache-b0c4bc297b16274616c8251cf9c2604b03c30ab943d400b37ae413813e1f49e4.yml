text: No, 'Boiling water' and 'Hard Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are two distinct types of water with different
  properties and characteristics. Boiling water refers to water that has been heated
  to its boiling point, while hard water refers to water with high mineral content,
  specifically calcium and magnesium ions. Although both concepts may appear in the
  context of drinking water, they represent different aspects and should be treated
  as separate instances.
