text: No, while both chicken and turkey meatballs are poultry-derived food, they should
  not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates because they are made from different
  types of poultry meat. The differences in the types of meat can affect the taste,
  texture, and nutritional content of the meatballs, so they should be treated as
  distinct instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
