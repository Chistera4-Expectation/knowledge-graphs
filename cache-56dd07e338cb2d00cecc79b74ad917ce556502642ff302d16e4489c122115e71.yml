  While both instances involve chicken, they represent different types of food products.
  Chicken refers to the meat or flesh of a bird, while chicken/vegetable stock is
  a liquid food product derived from simmering chicken and vegetables, typically used
  as a base for soups, sauces, and other dishes. They have different nutritional profiles
  and uses in cooking, and should be treated as distinct instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
