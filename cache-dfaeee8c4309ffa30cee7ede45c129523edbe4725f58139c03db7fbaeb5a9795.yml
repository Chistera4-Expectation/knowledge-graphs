text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both types of water can be oxygenated and spring-fed, they are different categories
  with distinct characteristics. Oxygenated water can refer to water that has been
  artificially infused with oxygen, while spring-fed water comes from natural underground
  sources. Merging these categories would result in a loss of specificity and clarity
  in the classification of drinking water.
