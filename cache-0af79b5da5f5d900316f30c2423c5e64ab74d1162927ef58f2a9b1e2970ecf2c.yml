text: ' The most adequate class for "Buns" would be "Bread". Buns are a type of bread,
  typically small and round with a soft interior and often topped with seeds or grains.
  While there may be some overlap between buns and other categories (such as pastries
  or rolls), the closest fitting category based on ingredients and preparation method
  is still bread.'
