text: ' Tea is the most appropriate choice for enhancing skin glow among Coffee and
  Tea. Green tea, in particular, contains antioxidants that can help improve skin
  health and provide a natural glow. However, it is important to note that moderation
  should be practiced with both options as excessive caffeine intake may have negative
  effects on overall health. Drinking water and maintaining proper hydration also
  plays an essential role in achieving healthy glowing skin.'
