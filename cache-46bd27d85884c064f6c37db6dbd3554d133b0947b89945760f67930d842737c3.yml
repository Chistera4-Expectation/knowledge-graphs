text: ' No. While both "sodium per serving" and "trans fat per serving" provide information
  about the nutritional content of cheese, they measure different components and are
  not duplicates. Sodium is an essential mineral for the human body, while trans fats
  are a type of unsaturated fat that can have negative health effects when consumed
  in excess. Therefore, it is important to keep track of both values separately in
  order to maintain a balanced diet.'
