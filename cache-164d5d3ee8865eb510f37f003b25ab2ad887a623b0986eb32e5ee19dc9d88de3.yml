  While they share some similarities, Japonica Rice and Short-grain Rice are distinct
  types of rice. Japonica Rice is a subcategory of short-grain rice, and there are
  other types of short-grain rice, such as Arborio and Calrose, which are not Japonica
  Rice. Merging them together would obscure these distinctions.
