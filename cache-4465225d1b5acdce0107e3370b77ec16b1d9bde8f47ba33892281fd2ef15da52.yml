text: No, Castor Oil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are distinct edible vegetable oils with different
  properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Castor oil is derived from the seeds
  of the castor oil plant, while Extra Virgin Olive Oil comes from the fruit of the
  olive tree. These oils have different fatty acid compositions, flavors, and uses
  in cooking and other applications.
