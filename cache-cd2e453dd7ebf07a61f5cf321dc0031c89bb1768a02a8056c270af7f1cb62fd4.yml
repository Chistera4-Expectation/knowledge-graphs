text: ' No. Basmati rice and brown rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they may both fall under the broader category of "rice." They have different
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and cultural significance. Therefore, it is
  important to maintain them as separate instances in a knowledge graph or database
  related to food and nutrition.'
