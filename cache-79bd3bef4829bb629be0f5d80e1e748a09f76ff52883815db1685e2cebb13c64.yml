  Potassium sorbate and sodium acetate are two different chemical compounds with distinct
  chemical properties and functions in food preservation. While they are both preservatives,
  they have different mechanisms of action and are used in different food categories.
  Therefore, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
