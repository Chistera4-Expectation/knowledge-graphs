text: ' No. Fresh cilantro leaves and bitter leaf are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, despite both being types of edible vegetation. They have distinct tastes
  (cilantro is known for its bright, citrusy flavor while bitter leaf has a strong,
  well, bitter taste), textures, appearances, and cultural uses. Therefore, they should
  remain separate instances within the Edible Vegetable class.'
