text: ' No. While scotch bonnet peppers and habanero peppers are similar in terms
  of heat level and taste, they are not exactly the same thing. Scotch bonnet peppers
  have a more fruity flavor compared to habanero peppers which have a slightly more
  bitter flavor. Additionally, scotch bonnet peppers can come in different colors
  such as yellow, orange, red and green while habaneros are typically red or orange
  when mature. Therefore, it would not be accurate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
