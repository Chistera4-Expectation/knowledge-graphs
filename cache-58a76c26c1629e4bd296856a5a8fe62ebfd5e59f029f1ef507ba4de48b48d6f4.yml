  While both processed meats and thinly sliced meat can involve some processing, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Processed meats typically refer to meats
  that have been treated (e.g., salting, curing, smoking) to enhance flavor or preservation,
  often leading to changes in texture and nutritional content; examples include ham,
  bacon, hot dogs, and sausages. Thinly sliced meat, on the other hand, generally
  refers to any type of poultry or red meat that has simply been cut into thin strips
  or slices, which may or may not undergo further processing. Therefore, these two
  concepts represent distinct classes within the realm of poultry-derived foods.'
