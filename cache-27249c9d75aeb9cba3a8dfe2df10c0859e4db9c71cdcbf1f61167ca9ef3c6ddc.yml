text: No, the instances 'Blewit Mushroom' and 'Hedgehog Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms,
  they are different species with distinct characteristics, appearances, and culinary
  uses. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique aspects of each mushroom.
