text: ' The most adequate class for "Water" would be simply "Water" or "Drinking Water".
  Other options like "Beverages" with a subcategory for "Water" could also work. However,
  it is important to note that the context of your question may influence the best
  classification choice. For instance, if you are designing a menu for a restaurant,
  then "Drinking Water" might be more appropriate as it distinguishes it from other
  types of water such as mineral water or sparkling water. If you are creating a nutritional
  database, then just "Water" might suffice since its primary purpose is to differentiate
  it from other liquid consumables.'
