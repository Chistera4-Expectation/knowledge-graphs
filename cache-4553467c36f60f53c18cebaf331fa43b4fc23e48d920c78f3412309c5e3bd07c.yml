text: No, the instances 'Infused Water' and 'Water' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they are related, they are not
  the same thing. 'Water' refers to the basic, unadulterated liquid, while 'Infused
  Water' refers to water that has been mixed with other ingredients, such as fruits
  or herbs, for flavor and potential health benefits. They have distinct properties
  and uses.
