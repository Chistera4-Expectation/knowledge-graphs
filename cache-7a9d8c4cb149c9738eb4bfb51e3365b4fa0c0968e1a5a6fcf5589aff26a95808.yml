text: ' No. While it is true that white wine is a type of wine, they are not exactly
  the same thing and do not have identical nutritional content. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates in an alcoholic
  drink class from a dietary perspective. It is important to maintain the distinction
  between different types of wines within this class for accurate nutrition tracking
  and analysis.'
