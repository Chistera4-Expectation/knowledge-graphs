  Although Caesar dressing and Thousand Island dressing are both types of salad dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients and flavors that make them unique from one another.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as semantic or
  ontological duplicates. Doing so could result in loss of important information about
  each type of dressing.'
