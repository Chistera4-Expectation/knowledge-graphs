text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Pepper" and "Red Pepper
  Flakes for heat" are related to seasoning, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  "Pepper" typically refers to black pepper, which is a different type of peppercorn
  than the one used in "Red Pepper Flakes for heat," which usually refers to dried
  and crushed red chili peppers. These two items have distinct flavors and uses in
  cooking.
