text: ' No. Avocado dressing and French dressing are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, and they should not be merged together. While both are types of salad
  dressings, they have distinct ingredients, flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles
  that make them unique from each other. Merging them would result in loss of important
  information about their individual characteristics and uses.'
