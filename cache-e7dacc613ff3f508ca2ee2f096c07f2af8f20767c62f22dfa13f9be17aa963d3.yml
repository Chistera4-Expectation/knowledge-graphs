  While horseradish dressing and lemon herb dressing may share some common characteristics
  (e.g., both are used to add flavor to salads), they have distinct ingredients and
  flavors that make them unique. Horseradish dressing typically contains grated horseradish
  root, vinegar, oil, and seasonings, while lemon herb dressing is made with fresh
  lemon juice, olive oil, chopped herbs like parsley and dill, and sometimes garlic
  and mustard. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
