text: ' No. While pork loin is a type of pork meat, it is not appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer to different concepts
  with distinct properties. Pork refers to the muscle tissue from a pig that can be
  processed and consumed in various forms, while pork loin denotes a specific cut
  from the animal, which has its unique characteristics, such as texture, flavor,
  and nutritional profile. Merging these terms would result in loss of essential distinctions
  between them.'
