text: No, the instances 'Yellow bell pepper' and 'habanero peppers' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types
  of peppers, they have distinct characteristics, such as color, flavor, and heat
  level. Yellow bell peppers are sweet, mild, and usually have a bell shape, while
  habanero peppers are small, very spicy, and have a distinct fruity flavor.
