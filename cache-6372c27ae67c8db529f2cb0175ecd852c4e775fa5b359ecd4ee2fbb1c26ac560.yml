text: ' No. Diced onions and red onion are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They refer to different forms of onions: diced
  onions are onions that have been cut into small cubes, while red onions are a variety
  of onions with reddish-purple skin and white flesh with a hint of purple. Therefore,
  they belong to separate concepts and should be kept distinct.'
