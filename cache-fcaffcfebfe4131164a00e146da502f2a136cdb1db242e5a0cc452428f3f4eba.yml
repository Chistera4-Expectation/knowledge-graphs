  Carbohydrates per serving and Vitamin A content per serving are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates because they represent different nutritional properties of
  cheese. Carbohydrates per serving pertains to the amount of carbohydrate present
  in a given serving size of cheese, while Vitamin A content per serving refers to
  the quantity of vitamin A found in that same serving size. These two attributes
  provide distinct information about the nutritional value of cheese and do not overlap
  conceptually or semantically. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them
  into a single attribute.'
