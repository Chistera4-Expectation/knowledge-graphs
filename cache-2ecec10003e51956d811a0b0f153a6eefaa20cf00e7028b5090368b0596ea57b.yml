text: ' No. Corn oil and cottonseed oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they are both types of edible vegetable oils. They come from different
  plants (corn and cottonseed, respectively) and have distinct nutritional profiles,
  production methods, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to maintain
  them as separate entries in an Edible Vegetal Oil class.'
