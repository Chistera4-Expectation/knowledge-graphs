  Cajun seasoning and Maggi seasoning cubes are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  despite both being used for adding flavor to food during cooking. They have different
  ingredients, flavors, uses, and cultural origins. Cajun seasoning is often associated
  with Creole and Louisiana-style cuisine, while Maggi seasoning cubes are commonly
  used in various Asian dishes. Merging them would overlook their unique characteristics
  and applications.'
