text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Ostrich Wings' and 'Ostrich'
  are poultry-derived food items, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. 'Ostrich'
  refers to the whole bird, while 'Ostrich Wings' specifically refers to the wings
  of the bird, which are a distinct cut of meat. They have different nutritional values,
  cooking methods, and uses in recipes.
