text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both Allspice and Five Spice Powder are used for flavoring, they are distinct spices
  with different compositions and flavor profiles. Allspice is a single spice, while
  Five Spice Powder is a blend of five different spices.
