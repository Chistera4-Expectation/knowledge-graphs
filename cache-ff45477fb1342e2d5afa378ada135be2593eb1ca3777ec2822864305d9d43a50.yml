text: " No. While both \"Dry Marsala Wine\" and \"Wine\" are types of alcoholic drinks,\
  \ they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Dry Marsala Wine is a specific\
  \ type of fortified wine produced in Sicily with its own unique production process\
  \ and characteristics, while \"Wine\" refers to a broad category of fermented grape\
  \ juice that includes many different varieties such as red wine, white wine, ros\xE9\
  \ wine, sparkling wine, etc. Therefore, these two terms cannot be considered as\
  \ semantic or ontological duplicates."
