text: ' No. Raspberry honey and sage honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They have distinct characteristics
  based on the type of nectar collected by bees from raspberries and sage plants,
  respectively. Merging them would result in loss of important information about their
  unique properties.'
