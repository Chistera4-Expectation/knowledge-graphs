text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of bread, 'Focaccia Bread'
  and 'Gluten-Free Bread' have distinct characteristics and ingredients. Focaccia
  bread is typically made with wheat flour, while gluten-free bread is made without
  any wheat or gluten-containing ingredients. Merging them would not accurately represent
  these differences.
