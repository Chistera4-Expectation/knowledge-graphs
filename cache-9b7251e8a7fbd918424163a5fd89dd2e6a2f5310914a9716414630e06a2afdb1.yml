text: No, 'Dandelion Honey' and 'Eucalyptus Honey' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. They are distinct types of honey with different
  flavors, properties, and botanical origins. Each type of honey should be represented
  as a separate instance in the Honey class.
