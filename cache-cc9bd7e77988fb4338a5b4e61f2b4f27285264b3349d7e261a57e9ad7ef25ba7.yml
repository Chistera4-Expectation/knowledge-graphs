  While both "chicken broth" and "chicken tacos" are poultry-derived foods, they cannot
  be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they represent different
  food items with distinct preparation methods and uses. Chicken broth is typically
  a liquid made by simmering chicken bones, vegetables, and aromatics to extract flavor,
  while chicken tacos refer to a dish that consists of cooked chicken meat served
  on a tortilla, often accompanied by various toppings such as salsa, cheese, or sour
  cream. Therefore, these two instances should remain separate within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.'
