  While "Caesar Dressing" and "Poppy Seed Dressing" may share some commonalities as
  types of food dressings, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and textures that differentiate them from
  one another. Caesar dressing is typically made with garlic, anchovies, mustard,
  lemon juice, egg yolks, and oil, while poppy seed dressing usually consists of vinegar,
  sugar, onion, vegetable oil, poppy seeds, and sometimes orange zest or dijon mustard.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as duplicates.'
