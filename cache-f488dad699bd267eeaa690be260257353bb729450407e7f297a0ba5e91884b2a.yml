text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they
  both refer to the same spice, 'Cumin' refers to the whole spice, while 'Ground cumin'
  refers to the ground version of the spice. These are different forms of the same
  spice and should be kept as separate instances.
