text: ' No, poppy seeds and quinoa seeds are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they are both types of seeds, they come from different plants (poppies vs.
  goosefoot) and have distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is important to
  maintain them as separate entities in an edible seed class for accurate categorization
  and information.'
