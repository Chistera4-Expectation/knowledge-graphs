  While both "Bread" and "Focaccia bread" refer to types of bread, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their ingredients, texture, and taste. Focaccia bread is
  a specific type of Italian flatbread that typically includes olive oil, herbs, and
  sometimes cheese, giving it a unique flavor and texture compared to regular bread.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
