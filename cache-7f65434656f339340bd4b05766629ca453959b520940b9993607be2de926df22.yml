text: ' No. While both pork belly and pork tenderloin are types of pork, they have
  distinct characteristics and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Merging these two concepts
  would result in loss of important distinctions between different cuts of pork with
  unique nutritional profiles and culinary applications.'
