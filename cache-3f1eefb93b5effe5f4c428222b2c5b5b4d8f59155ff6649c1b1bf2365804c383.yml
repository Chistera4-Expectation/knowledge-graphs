text: ' The most adequate class for "powder" would be "Food Seasoning", as many food
  seasonings come in powder form, such as salt, pepper, and various spices. However,
  it''s worth noting that not all powders are considered food seasonings, so other
  classes like "Edible Vegetable" (e.g., dried vegetable powder) or "Edible Seeds"
  (e.g., powdered flaxseed) could also be appropriate depending on the specific context.'
