text: No, they should not be merged together. Chili Powder and Five Spice Powder have
  different ingredients and flavor profiles. Chili Powder typically consists of ground
  chili peppers, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, and other spices, while Five Spice
  Powder is a blend of star anise, cloves, Chinese cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel
  seeds. Although both are used for additional flavor, they are distinct seasonings
  with unique properties.
