text: ' No. Dark soy sauce and Piri Piri sauce are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They have different ingredients, flavors, uses, and cultural origins. Dark soy sauce
  is a type of Chinese soy sauce with a thicker consistency and richer flavor due
  to aging and added molasses, while Piri Piri sauce is a spicy African-Portuguese
  condiment made from chilies, citrus, garlic, vinegar, and herbs. Merging them would
  result in incorrect information about their unique properties and applications.'
