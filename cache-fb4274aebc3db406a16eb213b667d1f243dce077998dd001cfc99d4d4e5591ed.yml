text: No, the instances 'Gluten-Free Bread' and 'White Bread' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the
  Bread class, they have distinct characteristics and properties, such as the presence
  of gluten and their nutritional content, which make them different from each other.
