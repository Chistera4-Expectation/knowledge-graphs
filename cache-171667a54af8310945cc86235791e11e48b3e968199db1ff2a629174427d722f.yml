text: ' No. Peanuts are not actually nuts; they are legumes. Therefore, they should
  not be merged with other nuts from a semantic and ontological standpoint. While
  peanuts have similar nutritional profiles to some tree nuts, their botanical classification
  is different, which warrants separate categorization for clarity and accuracy.'
