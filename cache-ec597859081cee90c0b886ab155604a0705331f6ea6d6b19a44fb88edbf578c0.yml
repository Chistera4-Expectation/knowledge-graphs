text: No, the instances 'Hoisin sauce' and 'Scotch bonnet pepper sauce' should not
  be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates because they are distinct types
  of sauces with different ingredients, flavors, and uses. Hoisin sauce is a sweet
  and salty sauce commonly used in Chinese cuisine, while Scotch bonnet pepper sauce
  is a spicy sauce made from the Scotch bonnet pepper, which is popular in Caribbean
  cuisine. They are separate entities with unique characteristics and should not be
  merged.
