text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Pheasant Gravy" and "Quail
  Gravy" are poultry-derived foods, they are different in terms of the specific type
  of poultry used in their preparation. This difference in the main ingredient makes
  them distinct from one another and should be treated as separate instances in the
  Poultry-derived Food class.
