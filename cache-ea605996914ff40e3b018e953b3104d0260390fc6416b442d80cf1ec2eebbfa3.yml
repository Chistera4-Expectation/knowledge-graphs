text: No, they should not be merged as they have different properties and uses in
  cooking. Cayenne pepper is a specific type of chili pepper with a spicy flavor,
  while freshly ground black pepper is a type of peppercorn with a more subtle, earthy
  flavor. Although they are both types of seasonings, they have distinct characteristics
  and applications in food preparation.
