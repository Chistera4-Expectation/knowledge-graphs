text: No, these two instances should not be merged as they have different purposes
  and properties. Distilled water is a type of water that has been purified by removing
  all impurities, while "Water for egg wash" refers to water used in the process of
  applying an egg-based wash to food items for various purposes such as glazing or
  sealing in moisture. Although both instances involve water, their intended uses
  and properties differ significantly.
