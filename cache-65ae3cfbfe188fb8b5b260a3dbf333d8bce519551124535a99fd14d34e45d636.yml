  The instances "Sliced tomatoes" and "Tomato paste" are not duplicate entries. They
  represent two different forms of tomatoes with distinct textures, tastes, and uses
  in cooking. Sliced tomatoes are fresh tomatoes that have been cut into thin pieces,
  while tomato paste is made by cooking down tomatoes to remove excess liquid and
  leave behind a concentrated, intense tomato flavor. These differences make them
  separate entities in the Edible Vegetable class.'
