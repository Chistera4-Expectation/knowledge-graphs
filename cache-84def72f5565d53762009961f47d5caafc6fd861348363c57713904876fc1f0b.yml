  While both "comb honey" and "heather honey" are types of honey, they refer to different
  things and do not represent semantic or ontological duplicates. Comb honey is a
  type of honey that still contains the wax comb built by the bees, while heather
  honey refers to any honey produced from nectar collected primarily from heather
  plants. They have distinct characteristics, production methods, and uses, so it
  would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
