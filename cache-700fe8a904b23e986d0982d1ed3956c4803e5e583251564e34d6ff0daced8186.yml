    content: 'If you''re asking for an example of how to create instances of a class
      `Milk` in programming and want examples of instance names, first, let''s quickly
      define a basic structure for the class `Milk`. Depending on the programming
      language being used, the syntax will differ. I''ll use Python for simplicity.


      Let''s say the class `Milk` has attributes like `brand`, `fat_content`, and
      `volume`. A quick definition might look like this:


      ```python

      class Milk'
