  Yes, it would be appropriate to merge ''Bell peppers'' and ''Red bell pepper'' as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates, as red bell peppers are a variety of bell peppers
  and share the same nutritional properties. However, it is essential to retain the
  specific information about the color of the bell peppers in the database to allow
  users to differentiate between different colors of bell peppers and their unique
  nutritional profiles.'
