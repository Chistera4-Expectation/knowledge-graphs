text: No, 'Grape' and 'Grapes' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While they refer to the same fruit, 'Grape' refers to a single fruit, while 'Grapes'
  refers to multiple fruits. They are distinct in terms of quantity, and therefore,
  should be treated as separate instances.
