  Although hemp seeds and sesame seeds share some similarities (for example, they
  are both sources of healthy fats), they have important differences that make them
  distinct from each other. Hemp seeds come from the cannabis sativa plant but do
  not contain significant amounts of THC, which is the psychoactive component found
  in marijuana. They are high in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and protein. Sesame seeds,
  on the other hand, come from the sesamum indicum plant and are rich in calcium,
  iron, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. They also contain lignans, which have been
  shown to have anti-inflammatory properties.


  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge hemp seeds and sesame seeds as semantic
  and ontological duplicates since they possess unique nutritional profiles and health
  benefits.'
