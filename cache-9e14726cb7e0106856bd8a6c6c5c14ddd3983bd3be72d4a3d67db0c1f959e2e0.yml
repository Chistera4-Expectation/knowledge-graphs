text: ' No. While shiitake and wood ear mushrooms are both types of edible mushrooms,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct characteristics
  such as appearance, taste, texture, and nutritional profiles. Merging them would
  result in loss of important information about each individual type of mushroom.'
