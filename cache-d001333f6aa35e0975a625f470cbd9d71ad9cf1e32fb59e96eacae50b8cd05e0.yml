text: No, European-style Butter and Whipped Butter should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the broader category
  of butter, they have distinct characteristics and uses. European-style Butter typically
  has a higher butterfat content and a richer flavor, while Whipped Butter is lighter
  and has air incorporated into it, making it easier to spread. These differences
  warrant their separation as distinct instances within the Butter class.
