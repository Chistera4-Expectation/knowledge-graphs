text: No, they should not be merged together. While both short-grain rice and sushi
  rice are short-grain varieties, sushi rice specifically refers to a type of short-grain
  rice that has been prepared with vinegar, sugar, and salt for use in sushi dishes.
  The preparation and use of sushi rice make it distinct from other short-grain rice
  varieties.
