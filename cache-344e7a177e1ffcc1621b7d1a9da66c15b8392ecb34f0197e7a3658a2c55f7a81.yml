text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are food seasonings, they
  have distinct flavors and properties. Five Spice Powder is a blend of five spices
  (typically cinnamon, cloves, fennel, star anise, and Sichuan pepper), while Onion
  Powder is made from dehydrated onions. They serve different purposes in cooking
  and are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
