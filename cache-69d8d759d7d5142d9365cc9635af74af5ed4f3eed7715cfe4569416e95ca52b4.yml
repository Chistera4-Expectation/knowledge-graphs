  While chia seeds and sunflower seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and other properties that make them unique
  from one another. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. Instead, they should be treated as separate
  but related entities within the larger category of edible seeds.'
