text: Yes, semantically and ontologically, 'Steamed white rice' and 'White Rice' can
  be considered as duplicates, as they both refer to the same type of rice prepared
  in the same way. However, in practical terms, it may be useful to keep them as separate
  instances if you need to differentiate between the two phrases in a specific context
  or if they are used in different parts of your data structure.
