text: ' No. Basil leaves and bitter leaf are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they may both fall under the category of "edible vegetables," they have distinct
  characteristics, uses, and nutritional profiles that make them unique from one another.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
