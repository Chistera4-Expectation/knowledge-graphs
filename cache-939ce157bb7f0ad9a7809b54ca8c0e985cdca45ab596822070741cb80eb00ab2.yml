text: ' "Edible Vegetables (specifically, Beans)" or simply "Beans" would be an appropriate
  class in this list. This is because beans are a type of edible vegetable that provides
  essential nutrients and can contribute to a healthy diet. Other food items on the
  list, such as meat products (beef, pork-derived food, poultry-derived food), dairy
  products (milk, cheese, yogurt), grains (bread, pasta types, rice), and oils (vegetable
  oil) have different nutritional profiles and functions in a balanced diet compared
  to beans.'
