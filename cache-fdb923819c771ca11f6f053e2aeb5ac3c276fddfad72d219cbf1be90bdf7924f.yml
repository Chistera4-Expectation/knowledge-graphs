text: As a dietician, my focus is on the nutritional aspects of food rather than the
  specifics of classifying or merging food items in a programming context. However,
  in terms of food items, "Thousand Island dressing" and "Thousand Island" refer to
  the same condiment, so they could be considered semantic and ontologic duplicates.
