text: No, Pheasant Stock and Pheasant Tenders should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are two distinct poultry-derived food products,
  with Pheasant Stock being a liquid made from simmering pheasant bones and aromatics,
  while Pheasant Tenders are a specific cut of pheasant meat. These two products have
  different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking, so they should be kept separate
  in a classification system.
