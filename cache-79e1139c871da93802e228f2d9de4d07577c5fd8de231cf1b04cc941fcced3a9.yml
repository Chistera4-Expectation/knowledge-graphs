text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Additional seasonings' and
  'Optional toppings' may serve a similar purpose in enhancing the flavor and appearance
  of a dish, they are distinct concepts. Additional seasonings typically refer to
  spices, herbs, or other flavorings that are mixed into the dish, while optional
  toppings refer to items that are added on top of the dish. Merging these concepts
  would not accurately represent the variety of ways in which food can be seasoned
  and flavored.
