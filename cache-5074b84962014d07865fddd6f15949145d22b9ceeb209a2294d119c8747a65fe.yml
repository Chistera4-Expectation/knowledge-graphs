text: ' No. Cream cheese and feta cheese are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of cheese. They have distinct characteristics, uses, and
  nutritional profiles that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to keep these two instances separate within the context of a cheese classification
  system.'
