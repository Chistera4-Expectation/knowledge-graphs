text: ' No. Dark soy sauce and tomato sauce are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  as they have different ingredients, flavors, uses, and nutritional profiles. Merging
  them would cause confusion and loss of important information about each individual
  type of sauce. It is essential to maintain their distinct identities for accurate
  labeling, recipe development, nutrition analysis, and food pairings.'
