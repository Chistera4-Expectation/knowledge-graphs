text: ' No. While both "Dry Marsala Wine" and "White Wine" are types of alcoholic
  drinks, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct characteristics
  such as production methods, regions, flavor profiles, and uses in recipes that make
  them unique from each other. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate
  within the Alcoholic Drink class.'
