  While blue cheese dressing and Caesar dressing may have some similarities (e.g.,
  both are often used as salad dressings), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They differ in their ingredients, flavors, textures, and culinary uses. Blue cheese
  dressing typically includes crumbled blue cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, vinegar
  or lemon juice, garlic, and seasonings; while Caesar dressing is traditionally made
  with raw egg yolks, olive oil, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, garlic,
  Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two concepts into one instance in a knowledge graph or database.'
