text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'Cooking oil' and 'Sesame
  Oil' are types of edible vegetal oils, they have distinct properties, uses, and
  characteristics. 'Cooking oil' is a general term for various types of oils used
  in cooking, while 'Sesame Oil' is a specific type of oil derived from sesame seeds,
  with its own unique flavor profile and nutritional benefits. Merging them would
  lose important information about each individual type of oil.
