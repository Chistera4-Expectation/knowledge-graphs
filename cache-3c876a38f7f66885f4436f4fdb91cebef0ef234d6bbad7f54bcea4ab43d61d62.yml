  While both cooked white rice and idli rice are types of rice, they have different
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Cooked white rice is simply steamed or
  boiled white rice that has been prepared for consumption, while idli rice specifically
  refers to parboiled rice that is fermented and ground into a batter to make idlis,
  a type of Indian steamed dumpling. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
