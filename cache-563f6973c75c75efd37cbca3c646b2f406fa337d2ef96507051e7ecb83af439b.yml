text: No, Flaxseed Oil and Safflower Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of edible vegetable oils with
  different nutritional properties and uses. Flaxseed Oil is rich in omega-3 fatty
  acids, while Safflower Oil contains more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.
  They serve different dietary purposes and are not interchangeable in all situations.
