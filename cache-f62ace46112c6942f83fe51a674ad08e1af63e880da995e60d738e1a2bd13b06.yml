  While cottonseed oil is a type of vegetable oil (since it is extracted from plants),
  not all vegetable oils are made from cottonseeds. Therefore, these two terms cannot
  be considered semantic and ontological duplicates. There are many other types of
  vegetable oils such as soybean oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, etc.,
  each with their own unique nutritional profiles and uses.'
