text: No, Hoisin sauce and Soy sauce should not be merged as they have distinct flavors,
  ingredients, and uses in cooking. Hoisin sauce is a thick, sweet, and salty sauce
  made from soybeans, while soy sauce is a thin, salty sauce made from fermented soybeans
  and wheat. They serve different purposes in cooking and are not considered semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
