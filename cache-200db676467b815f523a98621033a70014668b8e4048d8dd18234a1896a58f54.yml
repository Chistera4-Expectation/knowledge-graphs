  Although both artificial sweeteners like saccharin and natural sweeteners like honey
  provide a sweet taste, they have different chemical compositions, sources, and nutritional
  profiles. Artificially produced sweeteners are synthetic or chemically modified
  substances that contain little to no calories, while natural sweeteners (e.g., honey,
  maple syrup) come directly from plant sources and often contain some vitamins, minerals,
  or antioxidants. Therefore, it is essential not to merge these two categories as
  semantic and ontological duplicates since there are significant differences between
  them.'
