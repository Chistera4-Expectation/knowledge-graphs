text: 'No, the instances ''Flavored Butter'' and ''Unsalted Butter'' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types
  of butter, they have distinct characteristics: Flavored Butter has added flavorings,
  while Unsalted Butter does not. These differences make them separate entities in
  terms of classification and categorization.'
