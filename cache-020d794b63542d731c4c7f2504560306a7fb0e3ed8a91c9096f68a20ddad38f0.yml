text: No, the instances 'Glutinous Rice' and 'Sticky Rice' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are related, they are not the same.
  Glutinous rice is a type of rice that is particularly sticky when cooked due to
  its high amylopectin content. Sticky rice, on the other hand, is a more general
  term that refers to rice that has a sticky texture when cooked, and can include
  glutinous rice as well as other types of rice that become sticky when cooked. Therefore,
  they are related but not duplicates.
