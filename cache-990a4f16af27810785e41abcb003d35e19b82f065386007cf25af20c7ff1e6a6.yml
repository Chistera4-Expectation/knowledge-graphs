text: No, 'Chicken Liver' and 'Chicken Nuggets' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from chicken, they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional profiles and preparation methods. Chicken
  liver is an organ meat rich in iron, vitamins, and protein, while chicken nuggets
  are typically processed and breaded pieces of chicken meat that may have different
  nutritional values depending on the specific recipe or brand.
