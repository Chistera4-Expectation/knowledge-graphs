text: No, the instances 'Lassi Yogurt' and 'Low-Fat Yogurt' should not be merged together
  as they have different properties. Lassi Yogurt is a drink made from yogurt, water,
  and spices, while Low-Fat Yogurt refers to yogurt with reduced fat content. Although
  both are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics and uses.
