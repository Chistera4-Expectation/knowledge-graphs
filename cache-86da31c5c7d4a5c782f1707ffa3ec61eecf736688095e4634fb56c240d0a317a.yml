text: Yes, they should be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates,
  as they both refer to soy sauce and serve the same purpose of adding flavor and
  color to food. However, it's essential to keep the distinction between the two types
  of soy sauce in terms of their intended use (dark soy sauce for color and regular
  soy sauce for seasoning) for recipe clarity.
