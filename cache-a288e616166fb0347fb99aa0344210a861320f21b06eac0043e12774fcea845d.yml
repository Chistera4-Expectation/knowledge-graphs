text: ' Milkshake (made of Milk, Yogurt or both)


  Explanation: A milkshake is a beverage made by blending milk, ice cream, and sometimes
  other ingredients like syrups or fruits. However, in this context, since we are
  looking for alternatives to "milkshakes" that include butter, cheese, or just plain
  milk or yogurt as options, I suggest naming the classes as follows:


  1. ButterClass - For a drink made with butter and milk or water.

  2. CheeseClass - For a drink made with cheese and milk or water.

  3. MilkClass - For a simple glass of milk.

  4. YogurtClass - For a drink made with yogurt and milk or water.


  So, if you want to create a class specifically for milkshakes using any of these
  alternatives, it would make more sense to call it something descriptive based on
  the main ingredient(s), such as "ButterMilkshakeClass", "CheeseMilkshakeClass",
  etc., rather than trying to force-fit them all under one generic term like "MilkshakeClass".'
