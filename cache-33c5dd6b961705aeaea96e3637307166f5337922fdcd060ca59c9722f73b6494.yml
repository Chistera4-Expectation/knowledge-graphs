text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Kashmiri chili powder and
  onion powder are spices, they have distinct properties and uses in cooking. Kashmiri
  chili powder is a type of chili powder with a mild heat and vibrant red color, while
  onion powder is a dehydrated and ground form of onion used for flavoring dishes.
  They are not semantic or ontological duplicates, as they are different spices with
  unique characteristics.
