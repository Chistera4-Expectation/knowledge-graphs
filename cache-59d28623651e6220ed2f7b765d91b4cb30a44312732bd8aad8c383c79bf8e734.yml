text: No, Allspice and Five-spice powder should not be merged together as they are
  different seasonings with distinct compositions and flavor profiles. Allspice is
  a single spice derived from the dried berries of the Pimenta dioica plant, while
  Five-spice powder is a blend of five different spices, typically including star
  anise, cloves, cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds. They should be treated
  as separate entities in a Food Seasoning class.
