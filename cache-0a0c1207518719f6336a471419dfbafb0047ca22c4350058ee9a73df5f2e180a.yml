  While both chicken breasts and chicken nuggets are derived from chickens and can
  therefore be classified under poultry-derived foods, they cannot be considered semantic
  and ontological duplicates because they differ significantly in their nutritional
  content, culinary uses, and preparation methods. Chicken breasts are typically leaner
  and higher in protein than chicken nuggets, which often contain added breading and
  fat for flavor and texture. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate categories
  for these items to provide accurate and helpful information to consumers.'
