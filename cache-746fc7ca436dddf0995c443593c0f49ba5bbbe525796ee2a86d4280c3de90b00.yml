text: No, "Guinea Fowl Meat" and "Guinea Fowl Thighs" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from the same
  animal, they refer to different cuts of the bird, which have distinct nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses. Merging them would not accurately represent the diverse
  nature of poultry-derived food.
