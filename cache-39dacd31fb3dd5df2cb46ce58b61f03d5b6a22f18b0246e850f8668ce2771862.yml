text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from ostrich,
  they are different types of food products with distinct nutritional profiles and
  culinary uses. Ostrich broth is a liquid prepared from simmering ostrich meat and
  bones, while ostrich drumsticks are a specific cut of meat from the ostrich leg.
  These differences make them unique instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
