  While both "Optional seasonings" and "Taco Seasoning" may seem related to food seasoning,
  they do not refer to the same concept and therefore should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.


  "Optional seasonings" refers to any type of seasoning that can be added to enhance
  the flavor of a dish based on personal preference. It is a general category that
  includes many different types of spices, herbs, and other flavorings.


  On the other hand, "Taco Seasoning" is a specific blend of spices used to flavor
  tacos and other Mexican-inspired dishes. While it could technically fall under the
  broader category of "optional seasonings," it has a distinct name and purpose that
  sets it apart from other types of seasonings. Therefore, it should remain a separate
  instance.'
