text: No, they should not be merged together. "Duck Drumsticks" and "Duck Stock" are
  different types of poultry-derived food products, and they have distinct nutritional
  values, preparation methods, and uses in recipes. While they are both derived from
  ducks, they serve different purposes and should be kept as separate instances.
