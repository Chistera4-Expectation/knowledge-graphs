text: ' A suitable class to focus on, in terms of promoting health and adequacy, would
  be ''Seasonings.'' This category includes herbs, spices, and other flavor enhancers
  that can make food more enjoyable without adding excessive calories, sodium, or
  unhealthy fats. By focusing on this group, you can help individuals create delicious
  and nutritious meals while minimizing the use of less healthy options like high-calorie
  dressings, sugary sweeteners, and salty seasonings.'
