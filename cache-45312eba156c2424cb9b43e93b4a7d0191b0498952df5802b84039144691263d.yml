  While both brown rice and sushi rice are types of rice, they have different nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking. Brown rice is whole grain rice that still has its
  bran layer intact, making it more nutritious than white rice varieties. It is often
  recommended for its higher fiber and protein content compared to other types of
  rice. On the other hand, sushi rice (also known as short-grain Japanese rice) is
  typically milled to remove some or all of the bran layers, resulting in a stickier
  texture when cooked. Sushi rice is specifically used for preparing traditional sushi
  dishes due to this unique texture. Therefore, these two types of rice cannot be
  considered semantic or ontological duplicates since they serve distinct purposes
  and offer varying nutritional benefits.'
