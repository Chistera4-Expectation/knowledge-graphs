text: ' "Drinking Water" would be the most appropriate class for broth. Although broth
  is often made from simmering vegetables, meat or fish in water and can contain some
  calories, it is primarily composed of water and its main function is to hydrate.
  The other classes listed are not as suitable because they include items that are
  typically consumed for different purposes such as alcohol consumption (Alcoholic
  Drink), caffeine intake (Coffee, Energy Drink, Tea) or added sugars (Honey, Juice).'
