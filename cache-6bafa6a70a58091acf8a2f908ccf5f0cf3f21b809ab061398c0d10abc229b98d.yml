text: No, 'Pork Chop' and 'Pork Shoulder' should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both derived from pork, they are distinct cuts of
  meat with different characteristics, cooking methods, and nutritional values. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate instances within the Pork-derived Food class.
