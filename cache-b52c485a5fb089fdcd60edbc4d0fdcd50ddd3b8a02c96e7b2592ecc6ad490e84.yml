text: As a dietician, I would say that "Low-Fat Yogurt" and "Yogurt" can be considered
  semantically related but not necessarily ontologic duplicates. They are two different
  types of yogurt with different nutritional properties. However, if the classification
  is simply based on the type of yogurt without considering its nutritional content,
  they could be merged together. Ultimately, the decision would depend on the context
  and purpose of the classification.
