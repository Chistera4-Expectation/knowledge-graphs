text: No, the instances 'Black Trumpet Mushroom' and 'Velvet Pioppini Mushroom' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are two different
  species of mushrooms with distinct characteristics, appearances, and culinary uses.
  Black Trumpet Mushrooms (Craterellus cornucopioides) have a trumpet-like shape and
  a black or dark brown color, while Velvet Pioppini Mushrooms (Agrocybe aegerita)
  have a velvety cap and a brown or reddish-brown color. Although they are both edible
  mushrooms, they have unique properties that warrant separate classifications.
