text: No, "Glacier Water" and "Sparkling Water" are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  They are different types of drinking water with distinct characteristics. Glacier
  water typically refers to water sourced from glaciers, while sparkling water is
  water that has been carbonated, giving it a fizzy texture. While they can both be
  classified as drinking water, they are not the same and should not be merged.
