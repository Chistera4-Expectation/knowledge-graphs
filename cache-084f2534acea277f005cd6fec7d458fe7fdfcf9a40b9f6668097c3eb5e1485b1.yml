text: No, baking powder and seasoning cubes should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They serve different purposes in food preparation, and
  merging them would not accurately represent their distinct uses. Baking powder is
  primarily used as a leavening agent in baking, while seasoning cubes are used to
  add flavor to dishes.
