  While cumin powder and turmeric powder are both types of spices and may have some
  similar uses in cooking, they have distinct flavors, aromas, and nutritional profiles.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  It is important to maintain their separate identities to accurately capture their
  unique properties and culinary applications.'
