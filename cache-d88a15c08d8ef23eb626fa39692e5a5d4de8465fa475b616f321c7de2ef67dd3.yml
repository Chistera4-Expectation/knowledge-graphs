text: ' "BSF Larvae" or "Black Soldier Fly Larvae" would be an appropriate class name.
  Honey is a food product and not a suitable class name for BSF Larvae as they are
  not a type of honey, but rather a source of protein-rich feed that can be used in
  the production of animal feed or human food.'
