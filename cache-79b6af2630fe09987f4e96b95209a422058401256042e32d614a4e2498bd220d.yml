  While both "how often an individual is drinking water throughout the day" and "infused
  water" are related to hydration and drinking water, they refer to different concepts
  and cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates. The first instance
  refers to the frequency of water consumption, while the second instance refers to
  a type of flavored water made by infusing it with fruits, herbs, or other ingredients.'
