text: No, Raspberry Honey and Wildflower Honey should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of honey, they have different flavors
  and characteristics due to the different nectar sources used by the bees. Raspberry
  Honey comes from the nectar of raspberry blossoms, while Wildflower Honey comes
  from a variety of wildflowers, resulting in unique flavors and properties for each
  type of honey.
