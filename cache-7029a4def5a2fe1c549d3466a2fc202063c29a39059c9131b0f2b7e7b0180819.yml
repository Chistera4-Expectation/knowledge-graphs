text: ' No. Feta cheese and serving size of feta cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While feta cheese is a type of cheese, serving size refers to the amount
  of that food item consumed during a single eating occasion. Therefore, they represent
  different concepts and ought to remain separate instances within a knowledge graph
  or database schema.'
