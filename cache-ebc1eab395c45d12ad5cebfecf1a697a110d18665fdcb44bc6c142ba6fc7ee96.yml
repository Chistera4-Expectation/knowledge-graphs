  While both crayfish and ground crayfish are types of crustaceans, they do not represent
  semantic and ontological duplicates and should not be merged. Crayfish typically
  refers to freshwater crustaceans that resemble small lobsters, which can be eaten
  whole or used for making stocks and soups. On the other hand, ground crayfish is
  a processed form of crayfish, where the meat has been removed from the shell, cooked,
  and then finely ground or mashed. These two concepts serve different purposes in
  culinary applications, even though their origin is similar. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to maintain them as separate entities within the edible crustacean classification
  system.'
