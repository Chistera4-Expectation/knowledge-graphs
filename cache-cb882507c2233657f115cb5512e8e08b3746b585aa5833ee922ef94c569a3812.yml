text: ' No. While white rice is a type of rice, it is not a duplicate of rice in general
  because there are many other types of rice (e.g., brown rice, black rice, wild rice)
  that have different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Merging "rice" and "white
  rice" would result in loss of important distinctions between these categories.'
