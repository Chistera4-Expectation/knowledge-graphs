text: No, Linden Honey and Manuka Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are types of honey, they come from different floral sources
  and have distinct properties and benefits. Linden Honey is produced by bees that
  gather nectar from linden (lime) tree blossoms, while Manuka Honey comes from the
  nectar of the manuka tree, which is native to New Zealand. Merging them would not
  accurately represent their unique characteristics and uses.
