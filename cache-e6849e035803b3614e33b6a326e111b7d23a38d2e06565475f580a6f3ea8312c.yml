text: 'No, the instances ''Quail Soup'' and ''Quail'' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are different entities: ''Quail Soup''
  is a dish made from quail, while ''Quail'' refers to the bird itself. Although they
  are related, they are not the same thing and should be treated as separate instances.'
