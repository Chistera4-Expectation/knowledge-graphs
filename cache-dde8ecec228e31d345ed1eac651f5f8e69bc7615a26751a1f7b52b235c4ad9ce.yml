text: ' No. Shredded mozzarella cheese and Swiss cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, despite both being types of cheese. They have different tastes, textures,
  nutritional profiles, and typical uses in cooking. Merging them would result in
  loss of important distinctions for consumers seeking specific cheeses with particular
  properties.'
