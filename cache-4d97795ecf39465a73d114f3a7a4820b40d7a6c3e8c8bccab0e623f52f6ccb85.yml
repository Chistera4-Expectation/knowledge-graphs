text: No, these two sauces should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although they both fall under the category of hot sauces, they have distinct flavors,
  origins, and uses in cuisine. Scotch bonnet pepper sauce typically uses scotch bonnet
  peppers, which are extremely spicy, while Sriracha sauce is made with chili peppers
  and has a slightly sweet flavor.
