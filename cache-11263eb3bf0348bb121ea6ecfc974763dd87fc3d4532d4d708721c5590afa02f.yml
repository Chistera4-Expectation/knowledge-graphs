text: ' No. Arborio rice and long-grain rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They belong to different categories of rice with
  distinct characteristics. Arborio rice is a short-grain rice that is commonly used
  for making risotto due to its high starch content which gives it a creamy consistency
  when cooked. On the other hand, long-grain rice has a lower starch content, resulting
  in separate grains after cooking, making it ideal for dishes like pilafs and salads.
  Therefore, they have unique uses and properties and should not be treated as interchangeable.'
