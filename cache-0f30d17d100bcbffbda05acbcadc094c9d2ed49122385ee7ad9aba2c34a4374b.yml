text: No, Basmati Rice and Japonica Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different types of rice with distinct characteristics
  and uses. Basmati Rice is a long-grain rice variety from the Indian subcontinent,
  known for its aromatic properties and fluffy texture when cooked. Japonica Rice,
  also known as Japanese Rice or short-grain rice, is a variety with a shorter, rounder
  grain, and is typically stickier when cooked, making it suitable for sushi and other
  Japanese dishes.
