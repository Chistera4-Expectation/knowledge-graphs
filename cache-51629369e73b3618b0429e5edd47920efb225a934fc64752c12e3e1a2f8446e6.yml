text: ' No. While both "Pork Spare Ribs" and "Roasted Pork" are types of pork dishes,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to distinct cuts
  of meat that undergo different preparation methods. Merging them would obscure these
  important distinctions for individuals who require specific information about food
  choices due to health considerations, allergies, religious beliefs, or personal
  preferences.'
