  While both are related to edible plants, 'Basil leaves' refer to the leaves of the
  basil plant used as a culinary herb, while 'Lotus Leaf Rice' refers to a dish in
  which rice is cooked and served in a lotus leaf. These are distinct concepts and
  should be kept separate in an Edible Vegetable class.
