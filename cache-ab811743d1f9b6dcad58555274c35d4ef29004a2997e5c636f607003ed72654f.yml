text: ' No. Coconut oil and peanut oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of edible vegetable oils. They have distinct chemical compositions,
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and sources (coconuts vs. peanuts). Therefore,
  it is essential to maintain them as separate entries with their unique properties
  and characteristics.'
