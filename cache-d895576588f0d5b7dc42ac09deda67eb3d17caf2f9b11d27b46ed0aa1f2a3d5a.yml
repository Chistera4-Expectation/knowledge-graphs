text: No, 'Distilled Water' and 'Spring-fed Water' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of drinking water,
  they have different properties and origins. Distilled water is purified water that
  has been boiled and then condensed back into a liquid form, while spring-fed water
  comes from an underground source and is typically untreated. These differences make
  them distinct types of drinking water.
