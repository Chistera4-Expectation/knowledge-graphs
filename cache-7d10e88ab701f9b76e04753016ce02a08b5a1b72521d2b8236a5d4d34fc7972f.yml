  Grapefruit and Guava fruit are different fruits with distinct nutritional profiles
  and culinary uses. While they are both citrus fruits, they have different flavors,
  textures, and vitamins. Merging them together as semantic and ontologic duplicates
  would not accurately represent the unique characteristics and significance of each
  fruit.'
