text: ' "Insects" would be the most adequate class for scorpions, as they are arthropods
  and not related to honeybees. While some species of scorpions do consume honey in
  captivity due to their sweet tooth, it is not a natural part of their diet in the
  wild. Insect-derived food includes various types of insects that can serve as a
  source of nutrition for scorpions, making this the more suitable category for them.'
