  Chanterelle mushrooms are a specific type of wild mushroom with a distinct flavor
  and texture, while "mushrooms" is a broader term that encompasses many different
  varieties of fungi. While they share some similarities, they have different nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses, making them not identical in meaning. Therefore, it''s
  appropriate to keep them separate.'
