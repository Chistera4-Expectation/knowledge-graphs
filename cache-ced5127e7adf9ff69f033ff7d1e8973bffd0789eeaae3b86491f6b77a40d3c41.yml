text: No, Argan Oil and Grapeseed Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different
  chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking and cosmetics.
  Merging them would not accurately represent their unique characteristics and properties.
