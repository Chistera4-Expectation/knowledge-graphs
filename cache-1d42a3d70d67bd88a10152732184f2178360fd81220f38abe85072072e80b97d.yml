  While both Guinea Fowl Meat and Guinea Fowl Sausage are derived from the same animal,
  they represent different food products with distinct nutritional profiles and preparation
  methods. Guinea Fowl Meat is a whole cut of the bird, while Guinea Fowl Sausage
  is a processed product made from ground meat and other ingredients. Thus, they should
  remain separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
