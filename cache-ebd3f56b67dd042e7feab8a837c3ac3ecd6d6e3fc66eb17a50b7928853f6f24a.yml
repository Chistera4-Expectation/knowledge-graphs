text: ' No. While lemons and lemon juice are closely related, they are not identical
  and have different nutritional profiles. A lemon is a whole fruit with fiber, while
  lemon juice is just the liquid extracted from the fruit, which contains less fiber
  but potentially higher levels of vitamin C. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep
  them separate in a dietary context.'
