text: No, these two mushrooms should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both edible mushrooms, they have distinct characteristics,
  appearances, and culinary uses. Chicken of the Woods Mushroom (Laetiporus spp.)
  has a chicken-like texture and flavor, while Velvet Pioppini Mushroom (Agrocybe
  aegerita) has a velvety texture and a mild, nutty flavor. They are different species
  and should be treated as separate instances in the Edible Mushrooms class.
