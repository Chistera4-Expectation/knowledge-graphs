  While both dried red pepper flakes and habanero peppers are types of spices and
  may add heat to dishes, they have distinct differences in flavor profile, potency,
  and culinary uses. Dried red pepper flakes typically consist of crushed red chili
  peppers and provide a general pungent and slightly sweet taste, whereas habanero
  peppers possess a unique fruity and smoky flavor with significantly more heat. Therefore,
  merging them would not accurately reflect their individual characteristics and applications
  within recipes.'
