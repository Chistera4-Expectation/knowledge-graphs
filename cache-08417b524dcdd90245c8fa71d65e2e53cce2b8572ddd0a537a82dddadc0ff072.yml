text: No, 'Ostrich Broth' and 'Ostrich Wings' should not be merged as they represent
  different poultry-derived food items. Ostrich Broth is a liquid derived from cooking
  ostrich meat and bones, while Ostrich Wings are a specific cut of ostrich meat.
  Although they are both derived from ostrich, they have distinct properties and uses
  in cooking and nutrition.
