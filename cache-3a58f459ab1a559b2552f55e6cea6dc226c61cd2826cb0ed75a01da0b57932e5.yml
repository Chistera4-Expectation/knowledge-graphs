text: No, Coconut Oil and Walnut Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  properties, compositions, and uses. Coconut Oil is high in saturated fats and has
  a high smoke point, making it suitable for high-heat cooking, while Walnut Oil is
  high in polyunsaturated fats and has a lower smoke point, making it better suited
  for salad dressings and other cold uses. Merging them together would not accurately
  represent their unique characteristics and uses.
