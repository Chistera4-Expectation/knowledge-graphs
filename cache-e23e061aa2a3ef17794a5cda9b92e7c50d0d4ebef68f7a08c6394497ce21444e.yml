text: As a dietician, I would suggest that while both cottage cheese and cream cheese
  are dairy products and have some similarities, they are not semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They have distinct nutritional profiles, textures, and uses in cooking
  and recipes. Therefore, they should not be merged together in the Cheese class.
