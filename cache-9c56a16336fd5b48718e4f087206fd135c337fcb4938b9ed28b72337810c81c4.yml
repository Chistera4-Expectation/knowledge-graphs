text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both 'Duck Gravy' and 'Quail Gravy' are gravy derived from poultry, they are
  distinct in terms of their ingredients, flavors, and nutritional profiles, as they
  come from different types of birds. Therefore, they should be treated as separate
  instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
