text: ' No, chicken nuggets and chicken salad should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both may contain chicken, they are distinct food items
  with unique ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. Chicken
  nuggets typically consist of ground and formed chicken pieces that are breaded and
  fried, while chicken salads usually feature chopped chicken mixed with various vegetables,
  dressings, and sometimes grains or pasta. Therefore, they represent different culinary
  concepts and serve different purposes in a person''s diet.'
