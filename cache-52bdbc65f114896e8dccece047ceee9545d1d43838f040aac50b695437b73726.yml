text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both duck and guinea fowl are types of poultry, and gizzards are a specific
  part of the birds, they are not the same food item. They differ in terms of taste,
  texture, and nutritional content. Therefore, they should be considered separate
  instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
