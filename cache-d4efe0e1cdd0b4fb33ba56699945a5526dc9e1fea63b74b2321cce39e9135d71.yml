text: No, Buffalo Milk and Macadamia Milk should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of milk, they come from different sources - Buffalo
  Milk comes from buffalos, while Macadamia Milk is a plant-based milk alternative
  made from macadamia nuts. They have different nutritional profiles and uses, so
  it's important to keep them as distinct instances in the Milk class.
