text: 'As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspects of the
  teas, but the decision on whether to merge the instances ''Lemon Tea'' and ''White
  Tea'' as semantic and ontologic duplicates depends on the context and purpose of
  the classification system.


  However, from a dietician''s perspective, Lemon Tea and White Tea are different
  in terms of their ingredients and flavors. Lemon Tea is typically made by adding
  lemon to black or green tea, while White Tea is made from the young or minimally
  processed leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. Both teas offer potential health
  benefits, but their nutritional profiles may differ due to the presence of lemon
  in one and the absence of lemon in the other.


  So, based on the nutritional and flavor differences, I would not merge the instances
  ''Lemon Tea'' and ''White Tea'' as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
