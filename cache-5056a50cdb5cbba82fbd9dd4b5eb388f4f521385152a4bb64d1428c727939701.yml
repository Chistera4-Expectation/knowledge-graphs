text: No, they should not be merged together. Coconut water and soft water are distinct
  entities with different properties and uses. Coconut water is a natural beverage
  derived from coconuts, while soft water is a term used to describe water with low
  mineral content, often from a water softener or naturally occurring in areas with
  certain geological conditions. They serve different purposes and should not be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates.
