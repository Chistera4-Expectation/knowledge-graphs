text: No, Chili sauce and Sriracha sauce should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of sauces and may contain
  chili, they have distinct flavor profiles, ingredients, and usage. Chili sauce typically
  refers to a generic sauce made from chili peppers, vinegar, and spices, while Sriracha
  sauce specifically refers to a Thai-style hot sauce made from chili peppers, garlic,
  sugar, salt, and vinegar. Merging them would disregard their unique characteristics.
