text: ' No. Flaxseeds and kiwi seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged. While both are types of seeds, they come from different plants
  (flax and kiwi, respectively) and have distinct nutritional profiles and uses. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate within an edible seed classification system.'
