text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  Kefir Yogurt and Whole Milk Yogurt are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics
  and nutritional profiles. Kefir yogurt is a fermented milk product that contains
  probiotics and is typically thinner and more effervescent than traditional yogurt.
  Whole milk yogurt, on the other hand, is made from whole milk and contains more
  fat than lower-fat or non-fat yogurt varieties. Both can be part of a healthy diet,
  but they are not interchangeable due to their differences in taste, texture, and
  nutritional content.
