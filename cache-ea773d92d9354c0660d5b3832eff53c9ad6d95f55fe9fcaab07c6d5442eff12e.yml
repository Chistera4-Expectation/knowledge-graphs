  While both smoked turkey and turkey slices are types of poultry-derived food, they
  are not semantic nor ontological duplicates because they refer to different forms
  of processed turkey products with distinct characteristics. Smoked turkey is made
  by smoking whole or partial pieces of turkey meat, whereas turkey slices typically
  refer to thinly cut cooked turkey breast that can be served cold or reheated. Therefore,
  these two terms represent separate concepts within the poultry-derived food hierarchy.'
