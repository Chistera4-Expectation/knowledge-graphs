text: No, they should not be merged. Chai tea and Lavender tea are two different types
  of tea with distinct flavors and ingredients. Chai tea typically contains black
  tea, milk, and a blend of spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves,
  while Lavender tea is made from the lavender plant and has a floral taste. Merging
  them as duplicates would not accurately represent the differences between the two
  types of tea.
