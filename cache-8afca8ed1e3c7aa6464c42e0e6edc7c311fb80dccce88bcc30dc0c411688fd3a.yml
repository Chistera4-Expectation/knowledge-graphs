text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both Light Butter and Plant-based Butter are alternatives to regular butter, they
  have different properties. Light Butter typically contains less fat and calories
  than regular butter, while Plant-based Butter is made from plant-based ingredients,
  making it suitable for vegans and those avoiding dairy. The two types of butter
  cater to different dietary preferences and restrictions.
