text: No, Argan Oil and Pistachio Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are edible vegetal oils, they are derived from different
  plants and have distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses. Merging them would
  lose the specificity of each oil and create confusion.
