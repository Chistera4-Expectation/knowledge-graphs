text: ' No. Although Basmati rice and long grain white rice may have some similarities,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They belong to different categories:
  Basmati is a specific variety of rice with its own unique characteristics, while
  long grain white rice refers to a type of milled rice that can come from various
  varieties including but not limited to Basmati. Merging them would lead to loss
  of important distinctions between these two terms.'
