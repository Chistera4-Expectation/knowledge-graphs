text: 'As a dietician, my primary concern is to provide accurate nutritional information.
  From a nutritional perspective, plain yogurt and yogurt can be considered semantic
  and ontological duplicates since they refer to the same type of product. However,
  they may differ in flavorings, additives, or additional ingredients, which could
  have an impact on their nutritional value. To provide a comprehensive understanding
  of both types of yogurt, it would be beneficial to maintain separate instances and
  provide information on their differences, rather than merging them.


  To summarize, while plain yogurt and yogurt can be considered semantic and ontological
  duplicates, it is more useful to keep them as separate instances to highlight any
  potential differences in ingredients and nutritional value.'
