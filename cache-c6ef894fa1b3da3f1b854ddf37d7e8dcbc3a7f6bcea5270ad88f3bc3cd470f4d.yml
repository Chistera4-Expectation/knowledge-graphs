text: No, they should not be merged. While both 'Dandelion Honey' and 'Manuka Honey'
  are types of honey, they have distinct characteristics and properties that set them
  apart from one another. Dandelion honey is derived from the nectar of dandelion
  flowers, while Manuka honey is produced by bees that feed on the Manuka tree's nectar.
  These differences in the source of nectar result in unique flavors, nutritional
  profiles, and medicinal properties specific to each type of honey. Therefore, they
  should be treated as separate entities within the Honey class.
