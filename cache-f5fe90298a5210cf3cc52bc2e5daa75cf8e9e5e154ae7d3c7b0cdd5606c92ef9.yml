text: No, Canola Oil and Olive Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct differences
  in terms of their nutritional profiles, taste, and uses in cooking. Canola oil is
  lower in saturated fat and has a higher smoke point, making it suitable for high-heat
  cooking, while olive oil has a higher content of monounsaturated fat and a lower
  smoke point, making it better suited for lower-heat cooking and as a finishing oil
  for flavor.
