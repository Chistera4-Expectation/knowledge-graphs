text: ' No. French dressing and Poppy Seed dressing are two distinct types of salad
  dressings with different ingredients and flavors. While they may both be used to
  top salads, their compositions and characteristics make them unique from one another.
  Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic or ontologic duplicates.'
