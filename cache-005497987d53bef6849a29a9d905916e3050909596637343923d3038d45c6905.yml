text: No, Arborio Rice and Parboiled Rice should not be merged as they have distinct
  characteristics and uses. Arborio Rice is a short-grain Italian rice used primarily
  for risotto, while Parboiled Rice is a partially precooked rice that is softer and
  cooks faster than regular rice. Although both are types of rice, they serve different
  purposes and should be kept separate in a classification system.
