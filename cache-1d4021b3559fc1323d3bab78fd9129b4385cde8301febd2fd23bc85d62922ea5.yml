text: No, "Duck Gravy" and "Duck Thighs" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they both involve duck as the primary ingredient,
  they are different types of food items with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses. "Duck Gravy" is a sauce or liquid, while "Duck Thighs" are a specific cut
  of meat.
