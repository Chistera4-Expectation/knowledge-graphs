text: No, 'Buckwheat Honey' and 'Clover Honey' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of honey, they have different botanical
  origins, flavors, and nutritional properties. Buckwheat honey is darker and has
  a stronger flavor, while clover honey is lighter and milder. These differences are
  significant enough to warrant separate classifications.
