text: No, they should not be merged. While both are types of butter, they have distinct
  characteristics. Clarified butter is butter with the milk solids and water removed,
  making it more heat-stable and longer-lasting. Organic butter is butter made from
  organically raised dairy cows and adheres to organic farming practices. They are
  not semantic or ontologic duplicates and should remain separate instances in the
  Butter class.
