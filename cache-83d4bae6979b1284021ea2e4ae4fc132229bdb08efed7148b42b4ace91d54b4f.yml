text: No, Dandelion Honey and Wildflower Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their floral sources and taste profiles. Dandelion Honey
  comes from the nectar of dandelion flowers, while Wildflower Honey is made from
  a mixture of nectars from various wildflowers. These differences make them unique
  and distinct from each other.
