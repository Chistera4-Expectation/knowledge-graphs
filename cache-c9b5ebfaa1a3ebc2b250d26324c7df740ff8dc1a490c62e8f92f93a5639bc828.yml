text: No, the instances 'Chicken of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Maitake Mushroom' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are two different
  species of edible mushrooms with distinct characteristics, appearances, and nutritional
  profiles. Chicken of the Woods Mushroom (Laetiporus sulphureus) has a chicken-like
  texture and flavor, while Maitake Mushroom (Grifola frondosa) has a fan-like appearance
  and a rich, earthy flavor. Both are valuable for their unique nutritional properties
  and culinary uses, so they should be treated as separate entities in a dietician's
  classification.
