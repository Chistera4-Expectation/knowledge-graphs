text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of honey, they
  have distinct characteristics and come from different sources. Eucalyptus Honey
  is sourced from Eucalyptus trees, while Sourwood Honey comes from Sourwood trees.
  These differences make them separate entities in terms of semantics and ontology.
