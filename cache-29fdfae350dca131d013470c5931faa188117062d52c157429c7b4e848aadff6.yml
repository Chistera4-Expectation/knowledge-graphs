text: As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on the nutritional content of these
  vegetables, but the decision of merging them in a class or not is more of a task
  for a taxonomist or a software engineer. However, from a nutritional standpoint,
  green bell peppers are just unripe red or yellow bell peppers, and their nutritional
  content is generally similar. They are all considered "bell peppers," but the color
  difference may be useful in some cases for categorization purposes.
