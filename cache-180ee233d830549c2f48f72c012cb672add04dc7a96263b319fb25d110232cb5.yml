text: Yes, semantically and ontologically, 'Basil leaves' and 'Fresh Basil' can be
  considered duplicates, as they both refer to the fresh, edible leaves of the basil
  plant. However, in some contexts, 'Fresh Basil' may be used to refer to the plant
  as a whole, while 'Basil leaves' specifically refers to the leaves only. In a dietician
  context, merging them would still be acceptable due to their close relationship.
