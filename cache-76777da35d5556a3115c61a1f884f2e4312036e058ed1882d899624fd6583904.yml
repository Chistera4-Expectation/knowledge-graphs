text: No, Grapeseed Oil and Rice Bran Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they share some common properties as edible vegetable oils,
  they have distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking and
  food preparation. Merging them together would not accurately reflect their unique
  qualities and would lead to confusion in the classification and understanding of
  these oils.
