text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both 'Quail Drumsticks' and 'Quail Tenders' are derived from quail, they are distinct
  cuts of meat with different properties and culinary uses. Merging them would result
  in a loss of specificity and utility in a dietary context.
