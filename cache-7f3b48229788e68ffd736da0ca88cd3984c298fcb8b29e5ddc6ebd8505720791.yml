  Here''s the reasoning behind this choice:


  1. Cottage cheese, milk, and yogurt are all directly related as they originate from
  dairy sources. They share similar nutritional profiles with varying levels of proteins,
  fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.

  2. Butter is technically also a dairy product; however, it has undergone more processing
  than cottage cheese, cheese, milk, or yogurt. It contains higher amounts of fat
  compared to these other options, making its nutritional profile significantly different.
  Thus, grouping butter in the same category may not be ideal when discussing healthier
  choices.

  3. Among cottage cheese, cheese, milk, and yogurt, cottage cheese tends to have
  lower calorie content while providing an excellent source of protein. Cheese can
  vary widely depending on type but often has higher calories and saturated fat content
  compared to cottage cheese. Milk and yogurt both offer benefits like calcium and
  probiotics (in some cases), yet their sugar contents might differ based on whether
  they''re sweetened or unflavored.

  4. By naming the class "Dairy_Products," you maintain inclusivity without specifically
  highlighting any one item over another. This approach allows users to make informed
  decisions regarding which products suit their specific dietary needs best.'
