text: ' No. While both Poppy Seed Dressing and Russian Dressing contain poppy seeds,
  they are distinct salad dressings with different ingredients and flavor profiles.
  Poppy Seed Dressing is typically made from poppy seeds, sugar, vinegar, oil, and
  seasonings, while Russian Dressing contains ketchup, mayonnaise, chili sauce, Worcestershire
  sauce, and other spices. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.'
