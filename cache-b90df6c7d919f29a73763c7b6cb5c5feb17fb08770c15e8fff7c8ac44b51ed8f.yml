text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of tea with distinct
  characteristics. 'Infused Tea' typically refers to tea leaves or other plant material
  steeped in hot water, while 'Mint Tea' specifically refers to a tea made from mint
  leaves. While they both fall under the broader category of tea, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
