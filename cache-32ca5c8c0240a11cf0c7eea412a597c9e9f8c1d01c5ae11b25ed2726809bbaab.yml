  While both "Hot sauce" and "Sauce" are types of sauces, they cannot be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer to different subcategories
  within the broader category of sauces. "Hot sauce" is a specific type of sauce that
  contains chili peppers or other spicy ingredients, while "sauce" is a more general
  term used to describe various condiments with diverse flavors, textures, and uses.
  Therefore, it is essential to maintain these distinctions for accurate classification
  and communication about food items.'
