text: ' No. Fireweed honey and sage honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They come from different
  plant sources (fireweed vs. sage) which can affect their taste, color, and other
  properties. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between them.'
