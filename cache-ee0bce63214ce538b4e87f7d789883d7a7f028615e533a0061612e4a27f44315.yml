text: ' No. While nuts and peanuts are both seeds that can be eaten and have similar
  nutritional profiles, they belong to different botanical families: true nuts come
  from trees in the family Juglandaceae (such as walnuts and pistachios), while peanuts
  are legumes, belonging to the family Fabaceae. Therefore, it is important to keep
  them separate for accurate classification and understanding of their unique characteristics.'
