text: No, 'Alkaline Water' and 'Spring-fed Water' should not be merged together as
  they have distinct properties and characteristics. Alkaline water has a higher pH
  level than regular drinking water, while spring-fed water comes from underground
  springs and may have different mineral content depending on its source. These differences
  warrant separate classification.
