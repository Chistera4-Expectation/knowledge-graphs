text: ' No, raspberries and strawberries are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. While they are both red fruits that belong to the same
  order (Rosales), they are distinct species with different nutritional profiles and
  characteristics. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them as separate instances
  within the Edible Fruit class.'
