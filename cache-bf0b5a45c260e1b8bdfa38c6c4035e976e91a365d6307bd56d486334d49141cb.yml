text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Ostrich Patties" and "Turkey
  Patties" are poultry-derived foods and fall under the same class, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of poultry-derived food items,
  made from different birds (ostrich and turkey), and may have different nutritional
  profiles and preparation methods.
