text: ' No. While both caraway seeds and coriander seeds are edible and share some
  similarities in terms of their nutritional profile and culinary uses, they come
  from different plants and have distinct flavors and textures. Caraway seeds have
  a stronger, more bitter flavor and are commonly used in European and Middle Eastern
  cuisine, while coriander seeds have a warm, citrusy flavor and are commonly used
  in South Asian and Mexican cuisine. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
