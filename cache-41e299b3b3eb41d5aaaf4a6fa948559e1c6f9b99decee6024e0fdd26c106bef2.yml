  The two instances, "Browned butter" and "Butter, melted," are not identical in their
  preparation methods, taste, texture, and nutritional content. Browned butter has
  a distinct flavor and crispy texture due to the browning process, whereas melted
  butter is simply heated to a liquid state. They can be used differently in various
  recipes, making them separate entities rather than duplicates.'
