  Black rice and long-grain rice are not semantic or ontological duplicates and should
  not be merged together. They belong to different categories of rice with distinct
  characteristics and uses. Black rice is known for its high antioxidant content and
  dark color due to anthocyanins, while long-grain rice has a slender shape and is
  less sticky when cooked, making it ideal for various dishes like pilafs and stir-fries.
  Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions between these two types
  of rice.'
