text: No, the instances 'Bass' and 'Striped Bass' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they both belong to the Edible Fish class, 'Bass'
  is a more general term that can refer to several species, while 'Striped Bass' specifically
  refers to one species (Morone saxatilis).
