text: As a dietician, I would not advise merging the instances 'Naan Bread' and 'Sourdough
  Bread' as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the category
  of bread, they have different nutritional profiles, ingredients, and preparation
  methods. Merging them would not accurately represent the distinct characteristics
  of each type of bread.
