text: No, the instances 'Fresh Mozzarella Cheese' and 'Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese'
  should not be merged together as they are different types of cheese with distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and uses. Although both are cheeses, they belong to different
  categories and should be treated as separate entities in a classification system.
