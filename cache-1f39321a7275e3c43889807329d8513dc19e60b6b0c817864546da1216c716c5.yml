text: 'As a dietician, my answer is: No, they should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of seasonings,
  they are distinct ingredients with different flavor profiles and uses in cooking.
  Merging them would lead to a loss of specificity and potentially cause confusion
  when providing dietary advice or meal recommendations.'
