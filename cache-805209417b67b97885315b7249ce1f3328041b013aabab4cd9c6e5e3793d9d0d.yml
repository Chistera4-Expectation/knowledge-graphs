text: No, 'Chicken Drumsticks' and 'Chicken Stock' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of poultry-derived foods
  with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Chicken Drumsticks are a
  specific cut of meat from the leg, while Chicken Stock is a liquid made by simmering
  chicken bones, meat, and vegetables to create a flavorful base for soups, sauces,
  and other dishes.
