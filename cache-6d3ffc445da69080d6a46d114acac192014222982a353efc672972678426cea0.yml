text: No, "Duck Broth" and "Duck Thighs" should not be merged together as they are
  different poultry-derived food items. Duck Broth is a liquid made from simmering
  duck meat and bones, while Duck Thighs are a specific cut of duck meat. These items
  have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking.
