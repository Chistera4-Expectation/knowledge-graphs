text: ' No, rice paper wrappers and wild rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They are two distinct types of food that have different nutritional profiles, ingredients,
  uses, and origins. Rice paper wrappers are thin sheets made from rice flour and
  water, used for rolling and cooking various dishes such as summer rolls, while wild
  rice is an aquatic grass seed with a chewy texture and rich, nutty flavor, often
  used in salads, pilafs, and stuffing. Therefore, they should remain separate instances.'
