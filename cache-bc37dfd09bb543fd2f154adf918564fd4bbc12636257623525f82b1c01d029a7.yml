text: No, the instances 'Chanterelle Mushroom' and 'King Oyster Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct species
  of mushrooms with different characteristics, nutritional profiles, and culinary
  uses. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique properties.
