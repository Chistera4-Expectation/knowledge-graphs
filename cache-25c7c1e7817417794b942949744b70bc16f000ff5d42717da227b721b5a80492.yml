text: As a dietician, I would say that Pita Bread and Rye Bread are not semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are types of bread, they have distinct nutritional
  profiles, ingredients, and cultural significance. Merging them would not accurately
  represent their unique characteristics and could lead to misinformation.
