  While both "chicken salad" and "low-sodium chicken broth" are poultry-derived foods,
  they have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is not
  appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Chicken salad
  typically contains chicken meat, mayonnaise, vegetables, and seasonings, while low-sodium
  chicken broth consists of chicken bones, connective tissue, water, and minimal salt.
  These two food items serve distinct purposes in meal planning and preparation.'
