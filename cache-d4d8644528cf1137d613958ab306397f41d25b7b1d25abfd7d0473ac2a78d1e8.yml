  Artificial flavors and chili flakes are not semantic nor ontological duplicates.
  Artificial flavors refer to synthetic or artificial substances that mimic the taste
  of natural ingredients, while chili flakes are made from dried and crushed red chillies
  and used as a seasoning or condiment for their spicy flavor and aroma. They belong
  to different categories with distinct characteristics and uses.'
