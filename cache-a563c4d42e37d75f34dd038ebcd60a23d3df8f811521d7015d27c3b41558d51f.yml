text: Yes, it would be appropriate to merge 'Crab meat' and 'Crab' as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates in the Edible Crustaceans class, as they both refer to the
  same organism. However, it's essential to consider any distinctions between the
  terms used in specific contexts or regional variations.
