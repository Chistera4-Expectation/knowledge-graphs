text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Orange Blossom
  Honey and Raw Honey are distinct types of honey with different characteristics and
  origins. Orange Blossom Honey is made from the nectar of orange blossoms, while
  Raw Honey is unprocessed and unheated honey that retains its natural enzymes, vitamins,
  and minerals. Although both are types of honey, they are not duplicates of each
  other.
