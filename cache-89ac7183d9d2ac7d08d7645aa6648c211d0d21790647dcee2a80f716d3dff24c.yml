text: No, 'Boiling water' and 'Flavored Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of drinking water with different
  properties and characteristics. Boiling water refers to water that has been heated
  to its boiling point, typically used for sterilization or to make other beverages
  like tea. Flavored water, on the other hand, refers to water infused with natural
  or artificial flavors and may contain additional ingredients like sweeteners, herbs,
  or fruit. They are separate categories of drinking water with distinct purposes
  and uses.
