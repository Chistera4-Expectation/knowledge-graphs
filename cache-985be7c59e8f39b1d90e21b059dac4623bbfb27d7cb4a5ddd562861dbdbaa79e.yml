  While blackberries and blueberries are both types of fruit, blackberry honey and
  blueberry honey have distinct differences due to the different nectar sources from
  their respective flowers. Blackberry honey tends to have a tart, fruity flavor with
  a darker color, while blueberry honey has a mildly sweet taste and is usually lighter
  in color. Therefore, they shouldn''t be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates
  since they refer to separate products with unique characteristics.'
