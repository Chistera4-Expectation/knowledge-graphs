  While Italian dressing and Russian dressing may have some similarities in terms
  of their use as food dressings, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They have distinct ingredients, flavors, and cultural origins that make them unique
  from one another. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep these two instances separate.'
