text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  eggs are derived from poultry, they are distinct food items with different nutritional
  profiles, sizes, and uses in cooking. Eggs typically come from chickens, while quail
  eggs come from quails, and the two should be kept separate in a classification system.
