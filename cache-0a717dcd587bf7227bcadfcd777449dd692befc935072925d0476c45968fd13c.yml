text: No, the instances 'Juice' and 'Kiwi juice' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Juice' is a general term for a drink made by
  extracting the natural liquid from fruits and vegetables, while 'Kiwi juice' is
  a specific type of juice made from kiwis. Although they are related, they are not
  duplicates as they represent different concepts.
