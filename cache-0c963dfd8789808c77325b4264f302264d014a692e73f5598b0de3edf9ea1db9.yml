text: No, 'Glacier Water' and 'Purified Water' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  differences in their sources and processing methods. Glacier Water is sourced from
  melting glaciers, while Purified Water undergoes a purification process, which may
  include filtration, distillation, or reverse osmosis, to remove impurities. These
  differences in origin and processing make them distinct types of drinking water.
