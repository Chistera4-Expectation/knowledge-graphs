text: 'No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Distilled
  water and electrolyte water are different types of water with distinct properties
  and uses.


  Distilled water is water that has been purified through a process of distillation,
  which involves boiling the water and then condensing the steam into a clean container.
  This process removes impurities, minerals, and contaminants. Distilled water is
  often used in laboratories, aquariums, and for certain medical purposes.


  Electrolyte water, on the other hand, is water that contains added electrolytes,
  such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium. These electrolytes are essential for maintaining
  proper hydration and balancing the body''s fluids. Electrolyte water is often marketed
  as a sports drink or a way to replenish electrolytes after exercise or in cases
  of dehydration.


  While both types of water can be used for hydration, their composition and intended
  uses differ significantly. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic and
  ontologic duplicates.'
