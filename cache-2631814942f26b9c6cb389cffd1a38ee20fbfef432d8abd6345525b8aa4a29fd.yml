text: No, the instances 'Seasoning cubes' and 'seasoning' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are related, they are not the same
  thing. 'Seasoning' refers to the general concept of adding flavor to food, while
  'Seasoning cubes' are a specific type of seasoning, usually containing a combination
  of spices, herbs, and salt in a concentrated form.
