text: ' No. While both extra virgin olive oil and olive oil are types of vegetable
  oils derived from olives, they have different production methods and properties
  that make them distinct. Extra virgin olive oil is unrefined and has a higher concentration
  of antioxidants and monounsaturated fats compared to regular olive oil, which undergoes
  additional processing and refining steps. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
