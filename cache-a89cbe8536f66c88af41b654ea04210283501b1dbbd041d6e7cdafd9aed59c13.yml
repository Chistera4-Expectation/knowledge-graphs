text: ' No. Blackberry honey and buckwheat honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They are different types
  of honey with distinct flavors, colors, and nutritional profiles due to the nectar
  source of the honeybees. Therefore, it is important to keep them separate for accurate
  classification and information purposes.'
