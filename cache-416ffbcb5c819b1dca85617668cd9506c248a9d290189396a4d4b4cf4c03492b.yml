  While chopped and diced onions refer to cutting up an onion into small pieces, they
  differ in the size of the resulting pieces. Chopped onions typically have larger
  and more irregular pieces than diced onions, which are cut into smaller, uniformly-sized
  cubes. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
