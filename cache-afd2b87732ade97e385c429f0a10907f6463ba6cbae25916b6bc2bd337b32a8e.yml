text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of edible vegetable
  oils, they have distinct characteristics and uses. Cooking oil is a general term
  for various types of oils used in cooking, while Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a specific
  type of oil derived from olives and has its own unique properties and flavor profile.
  Merging them would result in a loss of important information and specificity.
