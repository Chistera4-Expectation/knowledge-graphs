text: No, the instances 'Crab meat' and 'Porcelain Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are edible crustaceans, they
  represent different species and have distinct nutritional and culinary properties.
  'Crab meat' typically refers to the meat from various crab species, while 'Porcelain
  Crab' is a specific type of crab (Petrolisthes spp.). Therefore, they should be
  treated as separate entities in a dietician's classification.
