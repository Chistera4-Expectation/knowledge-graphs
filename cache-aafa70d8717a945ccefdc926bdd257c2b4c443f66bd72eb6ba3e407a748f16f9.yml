  3. Bell peppers

  4. Celery

  5. Garlic

  6. Meat or seafood (such as chicken, sausage, shrimp, or crab)

  Note that there are many variations of gumbo, so the specific ingredients may vary
  depending on the recipe you follow. Some recipes call for file powder, which is
  made from ground sassafras leaves, to be added near the end of cooking. Others might
  include different types of vegetables or seasonings. It''s always best to check
  the specific recipe you plan to use for exact ingredient measurements and instructions.'
