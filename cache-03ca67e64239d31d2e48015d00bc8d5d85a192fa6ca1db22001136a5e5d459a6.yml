  While both "chicken pieces" and "chicken wings" are types of poultry-derived food,
  they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer
  to distinct cuts of chicken with different characteristics, flavors, and uses in
  cooking. Merging them would not accurately reflect their unique culinary identities
  and applications.'
