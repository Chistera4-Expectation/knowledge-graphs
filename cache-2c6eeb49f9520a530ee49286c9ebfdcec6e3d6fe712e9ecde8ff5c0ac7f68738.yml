text: ' No. Enoki mushrooms (Flammulina velutipes) and Morel mushrooms (Morchella
  spp.) are different species with distinct characteristics, flavors, and textures.
  They have different nutritional profiles and culinary uses, making them not identical
  or interchangeable. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
