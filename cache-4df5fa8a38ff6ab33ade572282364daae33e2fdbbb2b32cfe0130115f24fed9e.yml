  The two instances, "Boneless, skinless chicken breasts" and "Chicken broth," are
  not identical in terms of their composition, purpose, and nutritional content. Boneless,
  skinless chicken breasts are solid food pieces made from breast meat, while chicken
  broth is a liquid made by simmering chicken bones, meat, and vegetables. These differences
  make them distinct entities, so they shouldn''t be combined as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
