text: No, "Pheasant Broth" and "Pheasant Soup" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they both contain pheasant, they are different types
  of food. Pheasant broth is a liquid, typically used as a base for soups or sauces,
  whereas pheasant soup is a complete dish, typically containing a mix of ingredients
  in a broth or stock.
