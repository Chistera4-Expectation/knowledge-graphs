text: No, 'Duck Sausage' and 'Pheasant Sausage' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both sausages made from poultry, they are
  made from different types of poultry, which would make them distinct instances in
  the Poultry-derived Food class. They may share some similarities, but they are not
  duplicates.
