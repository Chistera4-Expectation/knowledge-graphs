text: ' No, Blueberries and Cherries should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they are both fruits, they belong to different genera
  (genetic categories) within the plant kingdom: Vaccinium (which includes blueberries,
  cranberries, and bilberries) and Prunus (which includes cherries, plums, peaches,
  and apricots), respectively. They have distinct nutritional profiles, growth habits,
  and uses, so it is important to maintain them as separate entities in the Edible
  Fruit class.'
