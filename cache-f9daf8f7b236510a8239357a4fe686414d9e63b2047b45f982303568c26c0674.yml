  While both safflower oil and sesame oil are edible vegetable oils, they have different
  nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses in cooking. Safflower oil is higher in monounsaturated
  fats and has a more neutral flavor, while sesame oil has a distinct nutty flavor
  and is higher in polyunsaturated fats. Additionally, sesame oil is often used as
  a flavor enhancer and has a shorter shelf life than safflower oil. Therefore, it
  is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
