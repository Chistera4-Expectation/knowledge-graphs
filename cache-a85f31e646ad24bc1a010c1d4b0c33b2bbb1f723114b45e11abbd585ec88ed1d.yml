text: ' ''Food Seasoning'' would be the most adequate class for sodium phosphates.
  Sodium phosphate is often used as a food additive, particularly in processed foods
  and seasonings to enhance flavor, improve texture and prolong shelf life. It can
  also be found naturally in some foods such as milk but at much lower levels compared
  to food seasonings.'
