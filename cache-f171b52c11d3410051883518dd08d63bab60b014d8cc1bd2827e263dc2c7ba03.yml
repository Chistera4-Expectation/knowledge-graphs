text: ' No. While both "Fiber per serving" and "Sodium per serving" provide information
  about nutritional content, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they refer to different nutrients with distinct roles in human health. Fiber is
  a type of carbohydrate that promotes digestive health and helps regulate blood sugar
  levels, while sodium is an electrolyte responsible for maintaining fluid balance
  and nerve function. Therefore, it is important to keep these attributes separate
  when describing cheese varieties in order to accurately convey their individual
  nutritional values.'
