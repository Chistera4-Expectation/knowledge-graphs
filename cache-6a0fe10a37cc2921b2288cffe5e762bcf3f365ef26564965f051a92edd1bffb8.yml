text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of dressings, 'Dressing'
  is a more general term and 'Russian dressing' is a specific type of dressing with
  its own unique ingredients and characteristics. Keeping them separate allows for
  more accurate categorization and distinction between different types of dressings.
