text: "As a dietician, my answer would be: No, they should not be merged together.\
  \ \n\nWhile both 'Infused Tea' and 'Peach Thyme Infusion' are types of tea, they\
  \ are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. 'Peach Thyme Infusion' is a specific\
  \ type of infused tea, and the terms are used to describe different aspects of the\
  \ tea. Merging them together would result in the loss of specific information about\
  \ the tea. It's essential to maintain the distinction between the general category\
  \ ('Infused Tea') and the specific type ('Peach Thyme Infusion') for accurate classification\
  \ and understanding of the tea."
