text: ' "Dairy" would be the most appropriate class for "Pudding," as puddings can
  be made with various dairy products such as milk, cream, or custard. The other options
  - butter, cheese, and yogurt - are also types of dairy but are less commonly used
  in making puddings compared to milk or cream. Therefore, using a broader category
  like "dairy" is more suitable.'
