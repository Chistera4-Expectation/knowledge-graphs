text: No, 'Flaxseed Milk' and 'Macadamia Milk' should not be merged together as they
  are different types of plant-based milk alternatives made from different ingredients
  (flaxseeds and macadamia nuts, respectively). Although they both fall under the
  broader category of 'Milk', they are distinct and serve different nutritional purposes
  and dietary preferences.
