text: ' No. Strawberry honey and Tupelo honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together as they refer to two distinct types of honey with
  different flavors, colors, and properties that result from their unique production
  processes and nectar sources (strawberries vs tupelo trees).'
