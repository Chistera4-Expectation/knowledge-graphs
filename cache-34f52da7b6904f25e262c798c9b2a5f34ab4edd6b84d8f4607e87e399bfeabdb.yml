text: No, 'Chicken Thighs' and 'Quail Thighs' should not be merged together as they
  are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they share the word 'thighs'
  and are both poultry-derived, they are different types of meat from different birds
  with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses.
