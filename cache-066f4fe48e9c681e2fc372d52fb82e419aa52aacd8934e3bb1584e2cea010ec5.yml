text: No, European-style Butter and Spreadable Butter should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They have distinct differences in composition, texture,
  and usage. European-style Butter typically has a higher fat content (82-86% fat)
  and is made from cultured cream, which gives it a tangy flavor. Spreadable Butter,
  on the other hand, is made with a blend of butter and a softer fat, such as canola
  or olive oil, to make it easier to spread directly from the refrigerator.
