text: No, they should not be merged together as they represent different types of
  bread preparation methods. Grilled Bread refers to bread that has been cooked on
  a grill, while Steamed Buns refer to a type of bread that is cooked by steaming.
  Although both are types of bread, their preparation methods and end results are
  distinct, making them separate classes within the broader category of bread.
