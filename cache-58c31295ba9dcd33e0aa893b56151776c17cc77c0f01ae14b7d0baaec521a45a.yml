text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from chicken, they have different preparation methods and nutritional
  profiles, making them distinct food items. Chicken gravy is a sauce made from chicken
  stock and other ingredients, while chicken meatballs are a mixture of ground chicken
  and other ingredients, shaped into balls and cooked.
