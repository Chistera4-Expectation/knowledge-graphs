  Canola oil and Olive oil are two different vegetable oils with distinct nutritional
  profiles and uses in the kitchen. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they
  have different flavors, fatty acid compositions, and health benefits. Merging them
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates would not accurately represent the
  unique characteristics and properties of each oil.'
