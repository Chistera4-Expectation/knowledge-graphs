text: ' The most adequate class for "Chinese sausage" would be "Pork-derived Food".
  Chinese sausage, also known as lap cheong, is typically made from pork and contains
  a high amount of fat. Therefore, it belongs in the same category as other foods
  derived from pork such as bacon, ham, and sausages.'
