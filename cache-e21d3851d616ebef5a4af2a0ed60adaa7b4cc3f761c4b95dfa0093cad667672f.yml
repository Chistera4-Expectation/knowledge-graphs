text: ' No. Comb honey and raspberry honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. They refer to different types of honey products with distinct
  characteristics.


  Comb honey is pure, unprocessed honey that still contains beeswax comb, whereas
  raspberry honey is honey produced by bees from the nectar of raspberries but does
  not contain any beeswax comb. Therefore, they belong to separate categories and
  do not constitute duplicates.'
