text: No, Brown Rice and Short-grain Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have distinct characteristics
  and nutritional values. Brown rice is a whole grain with the bran layer intact,
  while short-grain rice is a variety with shorter and wider grains. Merging these
  two types of rice would lead to a loss of important distinctions in their nutritional
  and culinary properties.
