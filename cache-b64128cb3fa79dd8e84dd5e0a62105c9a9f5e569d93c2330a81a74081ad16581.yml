text: No, the instances 'Pine Honey' and 'Wildflower Honey' should not be merged as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of honey, they have
  distinct characteristics based on the floral sources from which they are derived.
  Pine honey comes from the nectar of pine trees, while wildflower honey is made from
  the nectar of various wildflowers. Merging them as duplicates would disregard these
  differences and could lead to confusion or inaccurate nutritional information.
