text: No, 'Gluten-Free Bread' and 'Soda Bread' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of bread, they have different ingredients
  and properties. Gluten-Free Bread is made without gluten, while Soda Bread contains
  gluten. Therefore, they are distinct types of bread and should be treated as separate
  instances in the Bread class.
