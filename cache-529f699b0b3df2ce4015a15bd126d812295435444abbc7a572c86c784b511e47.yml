text: No, Lion's Mane Mushroom and Portobello Mushroom should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible mushrooms, they belong
  to different genera, have different characteristics, and are used differently in
  culinary applications. Lion's Mane Mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) is known for its
  unique appearance and potential health benefits, while Portobello Mushroom (Agaricus
  bisporus) is a popular culinary mushroom. Merging these two instances would lead
  to a loss of important distinctions between the two mushrooms.
