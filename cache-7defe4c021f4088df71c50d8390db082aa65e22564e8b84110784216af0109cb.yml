  While coriander powder is made from ground coriander seeds and white pepper powder
  is made from ground dried pepper berries (usually of the species Piper nigrum),
  they are not considered semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different
  flavors, uses, and chemical compositions that affect their taste and impact on health.
  They belong to distinct plant species with unique nutritional profiles, so merging
  them would not accurately represent their individual properties.'
