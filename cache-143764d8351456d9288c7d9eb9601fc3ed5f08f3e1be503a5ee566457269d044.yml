text: As a dietician, I would not merge 'Pork Loin' and 'Roast Pork' together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both involve pork, they are distinct cuts
  of meat with different nutritional profiles and cooking methods. 'Pork Loin' typically
  refers to the lean, boneless cut from the back of the animal, while 'Roast Pork'
  can refer to a variety of cuts cooked by roasting, including Pork Loin, Pork Shoulder,
  or Pork Belly. The preparation and cooking methods can significantly impact the
  nutritional content and flavor of the dishes.
