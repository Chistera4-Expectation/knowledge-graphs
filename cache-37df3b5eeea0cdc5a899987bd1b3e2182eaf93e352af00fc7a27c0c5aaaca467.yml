text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Creamy Yogurt' and 'Fruit-Flavored Yogurt' belong to the same category (yogurt),
  they are distinct types with different characteristics. Creamy Yogurt focuses on
  texture, while Fruit-Flavored Yogurt emphasizes flavor. They can be grouped together
  under yogurt, but they should not be merged as duplicates.
