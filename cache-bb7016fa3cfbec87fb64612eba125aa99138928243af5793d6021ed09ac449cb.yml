  While both Heather honey and Raw wildflower honey are types of honey, they have
  distinct characteristics that make them different from each other. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Heather honey is made primarily from the nectar of heather plants and has a distinctive
  flavor profile with a slightly medicinal taste. It also tends to have higher levels
  of antioxidants than some other honeys due to its unique composition.


  On the other hand, raw wildflower honey is made from the nectar collected by bees
  from various flowers growing in the wild. The specific floral sources can vary depending
  on the region where the honey is produced, leading to differences in flavor and
  color. As the name suggests, this type of honey is typically unprocessed and retains
  many of its natural enzymes and nutrients.


  Given these differences, it is important to maintain separate categories for Heather
  honey and Raw wildflower honey to accurately reflect their distinct properties and
  uses.'
