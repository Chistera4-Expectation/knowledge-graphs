text: No, Bell peppers and Dill pickles should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of vegetables with different nutritional profiles and properties.
  Bell peppers are a type of sweet pepper, while Dill pickles are made from cucumbers
  and have a distinct flavor from the addition of dill and vinegar.
