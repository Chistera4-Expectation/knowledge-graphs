text: ' No. Olive Oil Dressing and Thousand Island Dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of dressings, they have distinct ingredients and
  characteristics. Olive Oil Dressing is typically made from olive oil, vinegar or
  lemon juice, garlic, and herbs, while Thousand Island Dressing contains mayonnaise,
  ketchup, relish, onion, and sometimes hard-boiled eggs.'
