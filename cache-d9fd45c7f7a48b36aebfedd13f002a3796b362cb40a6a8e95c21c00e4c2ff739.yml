  While both cholesterol and vitamin A are types of nutrients found in cheese, they
  serve different purposes in the body and have different health implications. Cholesterol
  is a type of fat that can contribute to heart disease when consumed in excess, while
  vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin important for vision, immune function, and reproduction.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two properties into a single
  attribute, as they represent distinct aspects of the cheese''s nutritional profile.'
