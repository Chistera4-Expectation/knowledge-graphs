text: 'No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are related to cucumbers, they are different entities: ''Cucumber'' is a single
  vegetable, while ''Cucumber salad'' is a dish made with cucumbers and other ingredients.
  They have different properties and uses, so it is important to keep them separate
  in a classification system.'
