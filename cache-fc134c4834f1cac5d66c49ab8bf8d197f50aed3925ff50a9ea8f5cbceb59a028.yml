text: ' No. While peanuts are often referred to as groundnuts in certain regions,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) belong
  to the Fabaceae family, while true groundnuts belong to the APV family and include
  crops such as Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea). Therefore, these two terms
  refer to different things and should not be merged.'
