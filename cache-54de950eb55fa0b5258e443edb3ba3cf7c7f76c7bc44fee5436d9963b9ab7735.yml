text: No, Enoki Mushroom and Lion's Mane Mushroom should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the class of edible
  mushrooms, they have distinct characteristics, appearances, and nutritional profiles.
  Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the class.
