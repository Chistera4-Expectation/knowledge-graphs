text: ' The most adequate class for bouillon powder would be "Food Seasoning." Bouillon
  powder is a type of seasoning that is used to add flavor to various dishes, and
  it typically contains dehydrated vegetables, meat, or broth. It can be classified
  as a food seasoning because its primary function is to enhance the taste of other
  foods rather than serving as a standalone dish. Other classes such as beef or poultry-derived
  food may also apply if the bouillon powder is made from those specific ingredients.
  However, since bouillon powder has many variations beyond just beef or chicken flavors,
  "Food Seasoning" remains the broadest and most accurate classification.'
