text: No, Corned beef and beef patties should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are made from beef, they are different types of food products
  with distinct processing methods and uses. Corned beef is typically salt-cured and
  cooked, while beef patties are ground beef shaped into patties and often cooked
  on a grill or pan. Merging them would not accurately represent the distinctions
  between these two products.
