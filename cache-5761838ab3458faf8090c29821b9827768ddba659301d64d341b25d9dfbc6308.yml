  While chicken breast is a single ingredient that can be used to make dishes like
  chicken curry, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Chicken breast is
  a cut of meat with specific nutritional content, while chicken curry is a prepared
  dish made from various ingredients including (but not limited to) chicken breast,
  spices, and sauce. Therefore, these two instances represent distinct concepts within
  the context of poultry-derived foods.'
