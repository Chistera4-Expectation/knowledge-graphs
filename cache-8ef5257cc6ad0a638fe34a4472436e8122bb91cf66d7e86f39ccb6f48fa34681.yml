text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. Although both Herbal Tea and Rooibos
  Tea are types of herbal teas, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Herbal
  tea refers to any tea made from the infusion of herbs, spices, or other plant material,
  while Rooibos Tea specifically refers to a tea made from the leaves of the Aspalathus
  linearis plant, which is native to South Africa. They have different properties,
  flavors, and health benefits, so they should be kept as separate entities.
