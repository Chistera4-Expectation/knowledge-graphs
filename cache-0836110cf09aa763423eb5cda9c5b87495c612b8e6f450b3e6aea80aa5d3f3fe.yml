text: ' No. Teriyaki Dressing and Thousand Island Dressing are two distinct types
  of salad dressings with different ingredients and flavors. While they may both be
  used to top salads, they belong to different categories within the broader category
  of salad dressings. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic or ontological
  duplicates.'
