text: ' No, Apple and Pineapple should not be merged as they are distinct types of
  fruit with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. While both are fruits,
  they belong to different taxonomic categories: Apples (Malus domestica) belong to
  the Rosaceae family, while Pineapples (Ananas comosus) belong to the Bromeliaceae
  family. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological
  duplicates.'
