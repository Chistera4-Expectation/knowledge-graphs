text: No, "Pork Loin" and "Pork" should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both derived from pigs, they represent different cuts
  of meat and have distinct nutritional properties. Pork Loin is a specific cut of
  meat from the loin of the pig, while "Pork" is a more general term referring to
  meat from a pig. The two should be kept separate in a food classification system.
