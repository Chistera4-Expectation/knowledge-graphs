text: ' No. While French dressing and Ranch dressing are similar in that they can
  both be used as dressings for salads, they have distinct differences in terms of
  their ingredients and flavors. French dressing is typically made with oil, vinegar,
  mustard, sugar, and various herbs and spices, while Ranch dressing contains buttermilk,
  mayonnaise, and a variety of herbs and spices. Therefore, they should not be considered
  semantic or ontologic duplicates.'
