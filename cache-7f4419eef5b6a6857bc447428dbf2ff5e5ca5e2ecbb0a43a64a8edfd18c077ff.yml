text: ' No. Bell peppers and peppers are not semantic and ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged together. While bell peppers are a type of pepper (Capsicum
  annuum), they refer to a specific variety that is large, mild-tasting, and blocky-shaped
  with either green, red, yellow, orange, or purple skin. On the other hand, "pepper"
  is a more general term that can also include hotter varieties such as jalapenos,
  habaneros, and cayenne peppers. Therefore, it would be incorrect to merge these
  two concepts together.'
