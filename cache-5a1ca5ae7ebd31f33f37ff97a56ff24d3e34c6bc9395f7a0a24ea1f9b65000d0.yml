  While both pomegranate seeds (arils) and quinoa seeds are indeed edible seeds, they
  belong to different plant species and have distinct nutritional profiles. Pomegranate
  seeds contain high levels of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals while quinoa seeds
  are considered a complete protein with all nine essential amino acids. Therefore,
  merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates would not accurately reflect
  their unique properties and uses.'
