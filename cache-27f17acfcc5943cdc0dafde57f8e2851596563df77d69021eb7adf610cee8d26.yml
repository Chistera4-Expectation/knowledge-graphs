text: ' No. While both Asian Sesame Dressing and Teriyaki Dressing are commonly used
  in Asian cuisine and may contain sesame seeds, they have distinct flavors and ingredients.
  Asian Sesame Dressing typically consists of soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, sesame
  oil, and sesame seeds, while Teriyaki Dressing is made from soy sauce, mirin, sake,
  sugar, and sometimes ginger and garlic. Therefore, they should not be considered
  semantic or ontologic duplicates.'
