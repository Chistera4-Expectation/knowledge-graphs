  Oolong tea and Yerba mate tea are two different types of teas with distinct origins,
  flavors, and nutritional profiles. Oolong tea is partially fermented, while Yerba
  mate tea is made from the dried leaves of the South American holly tree. They have
  different antioxidant compositions and caffeine levels, so it''s not appropriate
  to merge them as duplicates.'
