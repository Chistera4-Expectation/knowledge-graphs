text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Soft Water' and 'Spring-fed
  Water' are types of drinking water, they have distinct characteristics and sources.
  'Soft Water' refers to water with low mineral content, while 'Spring-fed Water'
  comes from an underground source and may have different mineral content depending
  on the specific spring. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences
  in these types of water.
