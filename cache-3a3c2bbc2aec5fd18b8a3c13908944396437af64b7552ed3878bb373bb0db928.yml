text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  they may share similarities, "Creamy Yogurt" and "Whole Milk Yogurt" are distinct
  products. "Creamy Yogurt" may refer to a yogurt with a smooth and rich texture,
  while "Whole Milk Yogurt" refers specifically to yogurt made from whole milk. These
  are different properties and characteristics that should be kept separate.
