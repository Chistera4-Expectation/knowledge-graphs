text: ' No. Tomato paste and tomato slices are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  because they have different nutritional profiles and uses in recipes. While both
  come from tomatoes, their preparation methods significantly impact their taste,
  texture, and nutrition content. Therefore, it is important to keep them separate
  when discussing edible vegetables.'
