text: No, they should not be merged. 'Pickled vegetables' and 'Vegetables' have different
  properties and characteristics. 'Pickled vegetables' refer to vegetables that have
  undergone a pickling process, while 'Vegetables' refer to a broader category of
  edible plants. Although they are related, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
