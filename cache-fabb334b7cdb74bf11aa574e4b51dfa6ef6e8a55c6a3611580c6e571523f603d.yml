  While both "Pork fat" and "Pork spare ribs" are pork-derived foods, they are not
  semantic nor ontological duplicates. They have different nutritional profiles, textures,
  cooking methods, and uses in recipes. Merging them would result in loss of important
  distinctions between these two food items.'
