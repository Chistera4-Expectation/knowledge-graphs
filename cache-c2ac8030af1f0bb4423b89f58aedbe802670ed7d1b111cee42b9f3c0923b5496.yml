text: No, the instances 'Dried Cameroon Pepper' and 'White pepper' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of spices,
  they have distinct characteristics, flavors, and origins. Dried Cameroon Pepper
  is a specific variety of pepper from Cameroon, while White pepper is a different
  spice made from the seed of the pepper plant. Maintaining them as separate instances
  allows for accurate categorization and distinction between the two spices.
