  Although both Eucalyptus honey and Orange blossom honey are types of honey, they
  come from different plant sources (eucalyptus trees vs orange blossoms) which can
  affect their taste, color, aroma, and other properties. Therefore, they cannot be
  considered semantic or ontological duplicates and should not be merged.'
