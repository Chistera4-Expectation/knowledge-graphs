text: No, coconut water and glacier water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of "drinking
  water," they have distinct properties, origins, and nutritional values. Coconut
  water is a natural beverage derived from young coconuts and contains electrolytes,
  while glacier water is derived from melting glaciers and typically has a lower mineral
  content than other types of drinking water. These differences make them unique and
  not semantically or ontologically equivalent.
