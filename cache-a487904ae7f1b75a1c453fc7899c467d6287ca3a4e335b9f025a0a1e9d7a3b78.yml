text: ' No. While both Shaoxing wine and rice wine are types of alcohol that are made
  from fermented rice, they have distinct characteristics and uses in cooking and
  drinking. Shaoxing wine is a type of Chinese rice wine that has a rich, savory flavor
  and is often used in braising and stir-frying. Rice wine, on the other hand, can
  refer to any type of wine made from rice, including sake from Japan, mirin from
  Japan, and cheongju from Korea. These wines may have different flavors and purposes,
  so it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
