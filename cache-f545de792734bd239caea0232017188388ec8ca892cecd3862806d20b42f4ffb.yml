text: No, the instances 'Chanterelle Mushroom' and 'Lion's Mane Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, appearances, and nutritional
  profiles. Maintaining them as separate instances allows for accurate identification
  and understanding of each mushroom's unique properties.
