  The two instances, "guava paste" and "diced guava," are not identical in their preparation
  methods, textures, or uses in recipes, making them distinct culinary entities. Merging
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates would not accurately reflect their differences
  in the context of cooking and nutrition.'
