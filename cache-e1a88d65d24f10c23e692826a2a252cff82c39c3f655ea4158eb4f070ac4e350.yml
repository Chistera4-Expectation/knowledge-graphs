text: No, 'Blueberry Honey' and 'Orange Blossom Honey' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates, as they are different types of honey derived from different
  floral sources. Each type of honey has its own unique flavor profile and nutritional
  properties due to the distinct floral nectar sources.
