  Grape seeds and hemp seeds are distinct types of edible seeds that have different
  nutritional profiles and uses. Grape seeds contain antioxidants such as proanthocyanidins,
  while hemp seeds are high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Therefore, they cannot
  be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
