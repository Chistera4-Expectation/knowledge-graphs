text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  Guinea Fowl Thighs and Turkey Thighs are poultry-derived food, they are distinct
  types of meat with different flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles. Merging
  them would result in a loss of specificity and accuracy in describing these food
  items.
