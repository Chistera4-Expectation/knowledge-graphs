text: As a dietician, my answer is no. Although both Bulgarian and French yogurts
  are cultured milk products, they have distinct regional characteristics in terms
  of their production methods, bacterial cultures, and taste profiles. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
