text: As a dietician, I can provide insight into the nutritional aspects of these
  teas, but I am not an expert in ontology or semantics. However, from a nutritional
  perspective, 'Assam Tea' and 'Lavender Tea' are different types of tea with unique
  nutritional properties. Therefore, merging them as duplicates would not be accurate
  in terms of their nutritional content.
