text: ' No. Although both fresh raw fish and swordfish are types of edible fish, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to different specific
  kinds of fish with distinct characteristics and qualities. Fresh raw fish is a general
  term that refers to any type of fish that has been recently caught and prepared
  for consumption without cooking, while swordfish specifically refers to a large
  predatory fish found in warm tropical and temperate seas. Therefore, these two terms
  have unique meanings and uses in the context of discussing edible fish.'
