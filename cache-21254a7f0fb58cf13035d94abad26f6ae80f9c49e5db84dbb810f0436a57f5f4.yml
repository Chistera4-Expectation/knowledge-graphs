text: As a dietician, I would say that "Chicken Breast" and "Chicken" are not semantic
  and ontologic duplicates, as they are different parts of the chicken with different
  nutritional profiles. While both are derived from the same animal, they should not
  be merged together in a Poultry-derived Food class. So, the answer is no.
