text: No, the instances 'Non-Dairy Yogurt' and 'Whole Milk Yogurt' should not be merged
  together as they are distinct types of yogurt with different ingredients and nutritional
  profiles. Non-dairy yogurt is made from plant-based milk alternatives, while whole
  milk yogurt is made from cow's milk. They have different nutritional properties
  and cater to different dietary preferences and requirements.
