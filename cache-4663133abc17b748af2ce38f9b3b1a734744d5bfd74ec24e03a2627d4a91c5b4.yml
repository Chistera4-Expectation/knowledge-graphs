text: No, Glutinous Rice and Jasmine Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct properties
  and uses in cooking. Glutinous Rice has a higher starch content and is stickier
  when cooked, making it ideal for desserts and certain Asian dishes. Jasmine Rice,
  on the other hand, has a fragrant aroma and fluffier texture, making it suitable
  for various cuisines, including Indian, Thai, and Middle Eastern dishes.
