text: No, Rain Water and Spring Water should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of natural water sources, they
  have different origins, properties, and collection methods. Rain Water is collected
  directly from the atmosphere, while Spring Water comes from underground sources
  and emerges to the surface. These differences make them distinct types of drinking
  water.
