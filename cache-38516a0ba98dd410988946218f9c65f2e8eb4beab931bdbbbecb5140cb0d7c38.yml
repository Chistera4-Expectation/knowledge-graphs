text: No, "Duck Gizzards" and "Duck" should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are derived from ducks, they represent different parts
  of the animal and have distinct nutritional profiles. Duck Gizzards are a specific
  organ meat, while "Duck" typically refers to the meat from the muscle of the bird.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the differences in their composition
  and uses in a dietary context.
