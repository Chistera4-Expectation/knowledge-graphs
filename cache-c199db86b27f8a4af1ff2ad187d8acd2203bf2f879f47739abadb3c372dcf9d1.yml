text: ' No. Dark soy sauce and dipping sauce are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. They serve different purposes and have unique properties.
  Dark soy sauce is a type of soy sauce with a thicker consistency and richer flavor
  used mainly for coloring and seasoning dishes during cooking. In contrast, dipping
  sauce is a condiment served alongside food to add extra flavor and moisture before
  eating, which can contain various ingredients like soy sauce but also others such
  as vinegar, garlic, ginger, chili, etc., depending on the dish it accompanies.'
