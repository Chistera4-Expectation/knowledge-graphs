text: No, Butter and Buttermilk should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they both come from milk, they have different nutritional profiles,
  textures, and uses in cooking and baking. Butter is a high-fat dairy product used
  as a spread and in cooking, while buttermilk is a low-fat dairy product used in
  baking and as a drink.
