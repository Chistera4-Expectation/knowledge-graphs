  The two food items are not identical in terms of their composition, preparation
  method, and nutritional profile, making them distinct entities in the Poultry-derived
  Food class. Boneless, skinless chicken breast is a lean protein source with minimal
  fat and calories, while chicken sausages typically contain a mixture of meat and
  seasonings, possibly with added preservatives, fillers, and fats. Therefore, they
  shouldn''t be considered semantic and ontological duplicates.'
