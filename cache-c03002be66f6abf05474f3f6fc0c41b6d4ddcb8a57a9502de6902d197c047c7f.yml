  The two instances, "Roasted red bell peppers, diced" and "Scotch bonnet peppers,"
  are not duplicate entries. They refer to different types of peppers with distinct
  flavors, textures, and culinary uses. While they both belong to the same plant family
  (Solanaceae) and share some similarities in their nutritional profiles, they have
  different characteristics that make them unique and worth treating as separate entities
  in the Edible Vegetable class.'
