text: As a dietician, my answer would be no, they should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. While they both are sauces, they have distinct
  ingredients, flavors, and uses. Brown sauce and enchilada sauce serve different
  purposes in culinary applications, and merging them would not accurately represent
  their unique properties.
