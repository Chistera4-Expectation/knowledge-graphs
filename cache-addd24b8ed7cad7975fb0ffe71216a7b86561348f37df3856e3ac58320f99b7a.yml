text: 'No, Alkaline Water and Electrolyte Water should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both types of water may have some similarities
  in their properties and potential health benefits, they have distinct differences.


  Alkaline Water has a higher pH level than regular drinking water, which is thought
  to help neutralize acid in the body and promote better hydration. Electrolyte Water,
  on the other hand, contains added electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium
  to help replenish the body''s electrolyte balance, especially after exercise or
  in cases of dehydration.


  While both types of water may have some health benefits, they serve different purposes
  and should not be considered as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
