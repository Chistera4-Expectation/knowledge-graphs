text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  Quail Gravy and Quail Patties are derived from quail, they are distinct food items
  with different preparation methods and culinary uses. Quail Gravy is a sauce made
  from quail meat, while Quail Patties are formed from ground quail meat and typically
  served as a dish or patty.
