text: 'As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspects of the
  two types of butter, but it''s not within my expertise to determine whether they
  should be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. That question is more suitable
  for an expert in semantics or ontology. However, I can provide nutritional information
  for both types of butter:


  1. A2 Butter: A2 Butter is made from the milk of cows that produce only the A2 type
  of beta-casein protein. The nutritional content of A2 Butter is similar to regular
  butter, as it is made from the same ingredients - cream and milk. The main difference
  is the type of protein found in the milk. A2 Butter contains approximately 717 calories,
  81 grams of fat, 0.5 grams of carbohydrates, and 0.5 grams of protein per 100 grams.


  2. Organic Butter: Organic Butter is made from milk sourced from organically raised
  cows. The nutritional content of Organic Butter may vary slightly from regular butter,
  as it depends on the specific brand and production methods. However, in general,
  Organic Butter has a similar nutritional profile to regular butter, containing approximately
  717 calories, 81 grams of fat, 0.5 grams of carbohydrates, and 0.5 grams of protein
  per 100 grams.


  In summary, while the types of milk used in A2 Butter and Organic Butter are different,
  the nutritional content of both types of butter is quite similar. Whether they should
  be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates would depend on the context and purpose
  of the classification system.'
