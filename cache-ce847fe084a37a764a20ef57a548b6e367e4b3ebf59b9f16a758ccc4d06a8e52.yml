  The two food items are not identical in terms of their composition, preparation
  method, and nutritional profile, making them distinct entities in the Poultry-derived
  Food class. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are lean protein-rich meat, while
  chicken sausages typically contain a mixture of meat and fat, as well as added seasonings
  and preservatives. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
