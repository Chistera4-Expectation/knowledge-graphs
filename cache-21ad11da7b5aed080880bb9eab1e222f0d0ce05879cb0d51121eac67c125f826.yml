text: No, Cheddar cheese and Gouda cheese should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both types of cheese, they have distinct characteristics,
  production methods, and flavor profiles. Maintaining them as separate instances
  allows for accurate categorization and distinction in a dietary context.
