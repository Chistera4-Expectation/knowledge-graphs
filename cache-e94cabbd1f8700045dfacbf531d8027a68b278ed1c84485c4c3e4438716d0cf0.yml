  While black rice and long-grain white rice can both be classified under the general
  category of "rice," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and cultural significance. Black rice is often
  considered a healthier option due to its higher fiber and antioxidant content, while
  long-grain white rice is more commonly used in various dishes for its texture and
  taste. Therefore, it is essential to maintain these separate entities when discussing
  different types of rice in a dietary context.'
