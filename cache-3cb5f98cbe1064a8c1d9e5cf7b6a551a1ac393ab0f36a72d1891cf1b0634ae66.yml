text: No, the instances 'Cranberry juice' and 'Juice' should not be merged together
  as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Cranberry juice' is a specific
  type of juice made from cranberries, while 'Juice' is a general term for any liquid
  extracted from fruits, vegetables, or other plant materials. Although they are related,
  they represent distinct concepts and should be kept separate.
