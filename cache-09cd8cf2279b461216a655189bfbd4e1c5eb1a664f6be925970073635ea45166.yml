  While both chicken salad and chicken tacos contain chicken and can therefore be
  classified under the broader category of poultry-derived foods, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Semantically, these two dishes have distinct meanings
  and connotations. Chicken salad typically refers to a dish made with cooked chicken,
  mayonnaise, and various vegetables or seasonings, served on a bed of lettuce or
  between bread slices. On the other hand, chicken tacos refer to a Mexican dish consisting
  of cooked chicken wrapped in a tortilla with various toppings such as salsa, cheese,
  and sour cream.


  Ontologically, chicken salad and chicken tacos belong to different categories of
  food based on their preparation methods, ingredients, and cultural origins. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
