  While both Buckwheat honey and Cherry Blossom honey are types of honey, they have
  distinct differences in terms of their source, taste, color, and nutritional profile.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.
  It is important for a dietitian to understand these differences when providing advice
  on food choices and nutrition.'
