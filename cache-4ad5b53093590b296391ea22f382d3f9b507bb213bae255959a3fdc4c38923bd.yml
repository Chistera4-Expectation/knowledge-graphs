  While both kiwi seeds and mustard seeds come from edible plants and can be consumed,
  they have different nutritional profiles, uses, and culinary properties. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates
  in an "Edible Seeds" class as a dietitian. It is important to maintain accurate
  categorization of food items based on their unique characteristics and attributes.'
