text: No, Sage Honey and Tupelo Honey should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they are distinct due
  to their unique botanical origins and flavor profiles. Sage Honey is derived from
  the nectar of sage plants, while Tupelo Honey comes from the nectar of tupelo trees.
  These differences in origin contribute to variations in taste, aroma, and nutritional
  composition, making them separate entities within the Honey class.
