text: ' No. While pork loin and pork spare ribs are both cuts of pork and share some
  similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of their location on the animal,
  nutritional content, culinary uses, and cooking methods. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
