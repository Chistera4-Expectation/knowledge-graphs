text: No, "Frozen Yogurt" and "Lassi Yogurt" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of yogurt, they have distinct
  characteristics and preparation methods that differentiate them from one another.
  Frozen yogurt is typically a frozen dessert made from yogurt, while lassi yogurt
  is a yogurt-based drink commonly consumed in India and other South Asian countries.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between the two products.
