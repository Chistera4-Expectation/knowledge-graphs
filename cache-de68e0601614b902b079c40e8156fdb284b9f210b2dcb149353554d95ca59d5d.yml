text: ' No. Jasmine rice and wild rice are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They belong to different species of rice and
  have distinct nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and cultural significance.


  Jasmine rice is a type of long-grain rice that originated in Thailand and belongs
  to the Oryza sativa species. It has a soft, sticky texture when cooked and is often
  used in Asian cuisine for dishes like Thai curries and stir-fries.


  On the other hand, wild rice is not actually rice but rather a grass seed that belongs
  to the Zizania genus. It is native to North America and has a chewy texture with
  a nutty flavor. Wild rice is higher in protein, fiber, and several minerals compared
  to jasmine rice and is commonly used in soups, salads, and casseroles.


  Therefore, it would not be accurate to merge these two types of rice as they have
  unique properties and serve different purposes in cooking and nutrition.'
