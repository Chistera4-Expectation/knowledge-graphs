text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although both are sausages made from poultry, they are made from different types
  of poultry - Guinea fowl and quail, respectively. These differences can lead to
  variations in taste, nutritional content, and preparation methods. Therefore, they
  should be treated as distinct instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
