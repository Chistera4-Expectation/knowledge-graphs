text: No, Chili oil and Corn oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they are derived from different
  sources and have different flavor profiles. Chili oil is made from chili peppers
  and has a spicy flavor, while Corn oil is made from corn and has a milder, neutral
  flavor. They serve different purposes in cooking and have unique properties.
