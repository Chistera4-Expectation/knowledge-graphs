text: As a dietician, I would say that Chamomile Tea and Lemon Tea are not semantic
  and ontologic duplicates, as they have different ingredients and properties. Chamomile
  Tea is made from chamomile flowers, while Lemon Tea is typically made from black
  tea leaves and lemon. Therefore, they should not be merged together.
