text: ' No. Orange blossom honey and raspberry honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They are different types of honey with distinct flavors that come from
  nectar gathered by bees from specific flower sources: orange blossoms for orange
  blossom honey and raspberries for raspberry honey. Therefore, they should not be
  merged as duplicates but rather kept as separate categories to accurately reflect
  their unique characteristics and uses.'
