  Buckwheat flour and flour tortillas are not duplicate entries. Buckwheat flour is
  a type of flour made from ground buckwheat groats, while flour tortillas are a type
  of flatbread made from wheat flour, water, and sometimes other ingredients like
  salt and oil. They have different nutritional profiles, textures, and uses in cooking.
  Therefore, they should not be merged as duplicates.'
