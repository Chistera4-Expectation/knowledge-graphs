  While chicken breast and chicken wings are both types of poultry, they have different
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates from a dietary perspective.
  Chicken breasts tend to be leaner with more protein per serving than chicken wings,
  which can contain higher amounts of fat and calories depending on how they are prepared.
  Keeping these distinct helps provide accurate information for those considering
  their food choices based on nutrition or specific dietary needs.'
