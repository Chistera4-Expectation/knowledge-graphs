text: No, Raspberry Honey and Sunflower Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of honey, they come from different
  sources (raspberry flowers and sunflower plants, respectively) and have distinct
  flavor profiles and properties. Each type of honey has its own unique characteristics
  and should be treated as separate entities within the Honey class.
