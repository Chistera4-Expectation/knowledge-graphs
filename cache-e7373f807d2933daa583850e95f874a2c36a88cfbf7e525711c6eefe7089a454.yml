text: No, baking powder and garlic powder should not be merged together as they serve
  different purposes in cooking and have distinct chemical compositions. Baking powder
  is a leavening agent used in baking to help dough rise, while garlic powder is a
  seasoning used to add flavor to various dishes. They are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates.
