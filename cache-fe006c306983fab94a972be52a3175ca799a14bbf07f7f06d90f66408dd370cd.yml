text: No, they should not be merged as they have different ingredients and uses. Bouillon
  powder typically contains dehydrated vegetables, meat or vegetable broth, and seasonings,
  while Five-spice powder is a blend of five spices, often including star anise, cloves,
  cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds. These two seasonings serve different
  purposes and would not be considered semantic or ontologic duplicates.
