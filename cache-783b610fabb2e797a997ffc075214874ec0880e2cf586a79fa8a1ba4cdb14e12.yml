text: 'As a dietician, my answer is no. Although ''Grass-fed Butter'' and ''Organic
  Butter'' may share similarities, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.


  Grass-fed butter refers to the diet of the cows, which are fed mainly on grass,
  while organic butter refers to the production method, adhering to organic farming
  practices. Both can be grass-fed and organic, but they are not the same, as grass-fed
  does not necessarily mean organic, and organic does not necessarily mean grass-fed.
  They can coexist as distinct types of butter.'
