text: ' No. While "Name of the cheese" and "Category of cheese" may seem similar,
  they represent different concepts and serve distinct purposes in describing a cheese.
  The name refers to a specific type or brand of cheese (e.g., Cheddar), while the
  category indicates its broader classification based on factors like texture, milk
  source, aging process, etc. (e.g., hard cheese). Merging them would not accurately
  reflect their unique roles in cheese terminology.'
