text: ' The most adequate class for "Yogurt" among the given options would be simply
  calling it as a subclass of "Dairy Products" or specifically, "Fermented Dairy Products".
  However, if you are strictly limiting yourself to just these four options, then
  "Yogurt" itself is already an appropriate class name.'
