  While both "grass-fed beef" and "ground beef" are types of beef, they refer to distinctly
  different products with unique characteristics and uses. Grass-fed beef typically
  refers to beef from cattle that have been raised on grass and forage diets their
  entire lives, while ground beef is simply beef that has been finely chopped or ground
  into small pieces. Merging these two terms would not accurately reflect their differences
  and could lead to confusion regarding their nutritional profiles, culinary applications,
  and production methods.'
