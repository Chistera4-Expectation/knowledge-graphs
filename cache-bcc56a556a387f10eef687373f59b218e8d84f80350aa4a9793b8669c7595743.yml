text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from chicken, they have different nutritional values and preparation
  methods. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are a leaner option with higher protein
  content, while chicken patties may contain added fat, breading, or fillers. They
  serve different purposes in a diet and have different nutritional profiles.
