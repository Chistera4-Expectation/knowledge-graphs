text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of rice with distinct
  characteristics and nutritional profiles. Black Rice is a whole grain rice with
  a deep purple-black color, while Long-grain Rice refers to a variety of rice with
  long, slender grains that remain separate after cooking. Merging them would create
  confusion and inaccuracies in categorization.
