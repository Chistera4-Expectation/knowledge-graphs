text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  they both belong to the radish family, they have different characteristics and uses
  in culinary contexts. "Radish" typically refers to the small, round or elongated
  root vegetable, while "grated daikon radish" refers to the grated form of a specific
  variety of radish, daikon. Each has its own nutritional profile and culinary applications,
  so they should remain separate instances in the Edible Vegetable class.
