text: As a dietician, I would recommend not merging the instances 'Australian Yogurt'
  and 'French Yogurt' together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they
  are both yogurt, they have different origins, production methods, and potentially
  unique nutritional profiles. Merging them together would not accurately represent
  the distinctions between the two.
