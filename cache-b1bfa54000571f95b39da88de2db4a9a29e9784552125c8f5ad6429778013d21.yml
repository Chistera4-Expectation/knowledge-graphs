text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of poultry-derived
  food products. Pheasant Sausage refers to a processed meat product made from pheasant,
  while Pheasant Stock refers to a liquid made from simmering pheasant bones, meat,
  and vegetables, often used as a base for soups and sauces. Although both are derived
  from pheasant, they have different culinary uses and should be considered as separate
  instances.
