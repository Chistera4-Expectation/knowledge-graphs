text: ' No. Italian dressing and soy sauce dressing are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While both can be used as dressings, they have distinct ingredients
  and flavors. Italian dressing typically includes vinegar, oil, herbs, and spices,
  while soy sauce dressing is made primarily from soy sauce with various additives
  like sugar, garlic, ginger, etc.'
