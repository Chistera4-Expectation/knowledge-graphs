text: 'No, the instances ''Hedgehog Mushroom'' and ''Optional: Wood ear mushrooms''
  should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates. These are
  two different types of edible mushrooms with distinct characteristics, appearances,
  and uses in culinary contexts. Hedgehog Mushrooms are a type of wild mushroom with
  a spiny cap and a meaty texture, while Wood Ear Mushrooms have a crunchy texture
  and are often used in Asian cuisine.'
