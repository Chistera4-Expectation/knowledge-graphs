text: No, 'Chai Tea' and 'Rooibos Tea' should not be merged as they are different
  types of tea with distinct flavors, ingredients, and cultural origins. Chai tea
  is typically an Indian spiced milk tea, while Rooibos tea is a South African herbal
  tea made from the leaves of the Aspalathus linearis plant. They are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
