text: ' No. Onions and fried onions, boiled eggs, and nuts are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While onions may be one of the optional ingredients listed, they are
  different in form and preparation from fried onions, boiled eggs, and nuts. Therefore,
  they should not be merged together.'
