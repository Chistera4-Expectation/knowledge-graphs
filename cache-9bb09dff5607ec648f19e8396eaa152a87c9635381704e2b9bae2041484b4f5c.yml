  The terms "browned butter" and "unsalted butter" refer to different types of butter
  with distinct characteristics and uses in cooking. Browned butter has a richer,
  nuttier flavor and a darker color due to the browning process, while unsalted butter
  is made without salt and is often used in baking or recipes where a lower sodium
  content is desired. They are not interchangeable and should not be considered duplicates.'
