text: As a dietician, I would say that 'Infused Tea' and 'White Tea' are not semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both refer to types of tea, they have distinct
  properties and characteristics. Infused tea usually refers to any tea that is steeped
  in hot water, while white tea specifically refers to a type of tea made from young
  tea leaves and buds that are minimally processed. Therefore, the answer is no, they
  should not be merged together.
