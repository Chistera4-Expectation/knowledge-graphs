text: No, Hydrogen Water and Well Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  properties and sources. Hydrogen Water is infused with hydrogen gas, which may have
  potential health benefits, while Well Water is drawn from underground sources and
  its quality can vary based on the geology and location of the well.
