text: No, "Bang Energy" and "Monster Energy" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both energy drinks, they are produced by
  different companies and have distinct formulations and branding. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the real-world entities and their unique characteristics.
