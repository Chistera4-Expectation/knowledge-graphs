text: As a dietician, I can provide input on the nutritional aspects of the teas,
  but determining if they should be merged as duplicates is more of a domain-specific
  question. However, based on their names, they seem to be distinct types of teas,
  so they should not be merged as duplicates. The Blueberry Lavender Infusion likely
  contains blueberry and lavender ingredients, while Infused Tea could refer to any
  tea with additional ingredients. They may share some similarities, but they are
  not exact duplicates.
