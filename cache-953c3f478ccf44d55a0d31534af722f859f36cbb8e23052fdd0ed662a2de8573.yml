text: No, Catfish and Fish should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates
  in the Edible Fish class. Catfish is a specific type of fish, while Fish is a broader
  category that encompasses many different species. Merging them would result in a
  loss of specificity and clarity in the classification system.
