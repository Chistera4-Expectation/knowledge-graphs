  The two instances, "Chili peppers" and "Red bell pepper, sliced," are not exact
  duplicates. They refer to different types of peppers with distinct characteristics
  and uses in cooking, even though they belong to the same plant family. Chili peppers
  are typically smaller, have a spicy flavor, and are used for adding heat to dishes,
  while red bell peppers are larger, milder, and often used raw or roasted for their
  sweet, slightly bitter taste. From a culinary perspective, they are not interchangeable,
  so it is appropriate to keep them separate.'
