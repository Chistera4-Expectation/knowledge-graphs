text: No, Hibiscus Tea and Oolong Tea should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of tea, they have distinct properties,
  flavors, and potential health benefits. Hibiscus tea is made from the dried sepals
  of the Hibiscus sabdariffa flower and has a tart, cranberry-like flavor, while Oolong
  tea is a traditional Chinese tea that undergoes a unique fermentation process, resulting
  in a more complex flavor profile. Merging them together would not accurately represent
  their differences.
