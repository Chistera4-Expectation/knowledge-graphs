text: ' "Plant-Based Proteins" or "Vegetable Proteins" would be the most appropriate
  class names for plant-based meat alternatives. These terms encompass various options
  such as tofu, tempeh, seitan, textured vegetable protein (TVP), soy crumbles, and
  other meat substitutes derived from plants. This classification emphasizes that
  these foods are not made of animal products but still provide essential nutrients
  like protein.'
