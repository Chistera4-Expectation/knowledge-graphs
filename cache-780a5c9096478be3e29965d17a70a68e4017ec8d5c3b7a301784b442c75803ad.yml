text: As a dietician, I would suggest that 'Pork Tenderloin' and 'Pork' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived
  from pigs, they are different cuts of meat with distinct nutritional profiles and
  culinary uses. 'Pork Tenderloin' is a specific cut of meat from the loin, while
  'Pork' can refer to any part of the pig. Therefore, they should remain separate
  instances in the Pork-derived Food class.
