text: No, they should not be merged together. Forbidden Rice and Short-grain Rice
  are two distinct types of rice with different characteristics and properties. Forbidden
  Rice, also known as Black Rice, has a unique dark color and is known for its high
  nutritional value. Short-grain Rice, on the other hand, has a shorter and wider
  grain structure and is commonly used in dishes like sushi and risotto. They should
  be kept as separate instances in the Rice class.
