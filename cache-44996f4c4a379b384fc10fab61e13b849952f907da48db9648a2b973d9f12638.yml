text: No, the instances 'Pomegranate Seeds' and 'Seeds' should not be merged together.
  While both are types of seeds, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  'Pomegranate Seeds' refers specifically to the seeds found in pomegranates, which
  are a type of fruit. 'Seeds' is a more general term that encompasses a wide variety
  of plant seeds, including those found in pomegranates but also in countless other
  plants.
