text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. Although both 'Additional seasonings'
  and 'Seasoning cubes' could be used to add flavor to food, they are not exactly
  the same. Additional seasonings could refer to a wide variety of herbs, spices,
  and other flavorings, while seasoning cubes specifically refer to a concentrated
  form of flavoring, typically in the form of a cube or tablet. They may have some
  overlapping ingredients, but they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
