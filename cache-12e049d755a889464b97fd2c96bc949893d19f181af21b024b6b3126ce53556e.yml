text: No, "Pheasant Patties" and "Pheasant Thighs" should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from poultry, specifically pheasant,
  they represent different food preparations and can be classified as distinct instances
  within the Poultry-derived Food class. Pheasant Patties are typically ground and
  formed into patties, while Pheasant Thighs refer to the specific part of the pheasant.
  These differences in preparation and presentation warrant separate classifications.
