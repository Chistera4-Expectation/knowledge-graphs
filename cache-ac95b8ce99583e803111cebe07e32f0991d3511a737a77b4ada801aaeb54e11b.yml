text: No, 'Ground Pork' and 'Pork Loin' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both derived from pork, they represent
  different cuts and preparations of the meat. 'Ground Pork' is minced pork meat,
  while 'Pork Loin' is a specific cut of meat from the loin of the pig. These differences
  in cut and preparation result in distinct nutritional profiles and culinary applications.
