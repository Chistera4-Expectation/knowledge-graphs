text: ' "Beverages" could be an appropriate and concise class name for both coffee
  and tea as they are both popular hot or cold drinks consumed worldwide. Flavorings
  can refer to any added ingredients that enhance the taste of these beverages, such
  as sugar, milk, cream, lemon, honey, or spices like cinnamon or nutmeg. By categorizing
  them under the broader term "Beverages," you acknowledge their shared function while
  allowing room for further specificity regarding flavorings or other aspects of each
  drink.'
