text: No, the instances 'Hermit Crab' and 'Horseshoe Crab' should not be merged together
  as they are distinct species with different characteristics and roles in the Edible
  Crustaceans class. Hermit crabs are true crustaceans, while horseshoe crabs are
  more closely related to spiders and scorpions. They also have different diets, habitats,
  and behaviors.
