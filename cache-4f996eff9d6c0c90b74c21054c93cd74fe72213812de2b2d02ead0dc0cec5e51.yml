text: ' No. Mustard seeds and quinoa seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They belong to different plant species and have
  distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to
  maintain them as separate instances in an edible seed class.'
