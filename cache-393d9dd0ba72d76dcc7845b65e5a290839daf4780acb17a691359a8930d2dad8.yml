text: 'No, they should not be merged. Dark Soy Sauce and Five Spice Powder serve different
  purposes in cooking: Dark Soy Sauce is primarily used for color, while Five Spice
  Powder is used for flavor enhancement. Although they both contribute to the taste
  of a dish, their roles are distinct, and they should not be considered as duplicates.'
