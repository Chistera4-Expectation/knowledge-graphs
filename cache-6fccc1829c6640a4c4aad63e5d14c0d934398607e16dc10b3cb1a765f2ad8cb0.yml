  While both "vegetable broth" and "or vegetables" may involve similar ingredients
  (i.e., various kinds of edible vegetables), they represent different concepts with
  distinct roles within the context of a food-related classification system. Here''s
  why:


  1. Semantically, vegetable broth refers to a liquid preparation made by simmering
  vegetables in water, often used for cooking purposes or consumed on its own as a
  light, flavorful beverage. In contrast, "or vegetables" implies an option to include
  one or more types of vegetables in a dish or recipe, without specifying how those
  vegetables are prepared or presented.

  2. Ontologically, these two terms occupy different levels within a hierarchical
  structure. "Or vegetables" functions as an alternative choice or addition to another
  ingredient(s) in a broader category, whereas "vegetable broth" represents a specific
  type of product that can be classified under categories like soups, stocks, or cooking
  liquids.


  Therefore, merging them would not accurately reflect their unique meanings and applications.'
