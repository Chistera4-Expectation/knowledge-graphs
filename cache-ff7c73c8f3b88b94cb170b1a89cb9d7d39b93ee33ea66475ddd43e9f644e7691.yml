text: No, nuts and peanuts should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are considered edible seeds, they belong to different plant
  families and have different characteristics. Nuts are the seeds of plants in the
  family Juglandaceae, such as walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts, while peanuts are
  legumes and belong to the family Fabaceae.
