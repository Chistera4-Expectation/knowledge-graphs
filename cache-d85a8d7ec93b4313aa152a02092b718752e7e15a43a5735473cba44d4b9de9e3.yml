text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are types of butter, 'Butter Blend' and 'Organic Butter' have distinct characteristics
  and compositions. Butter Blend typically refers to a mixture of butter and other
  fats like vegetable oils, while Organic Butter is made from organic milk and follows
  organic farming practices. Merging them would lose this important distinction.
