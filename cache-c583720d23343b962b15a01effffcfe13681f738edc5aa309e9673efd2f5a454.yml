  While both instances are related to tomatoes, they are different in terms of their
  packaging and processing. 'Canned crushed tomatoes' refers specifically to tomatoes
  that have been crushed and packaged in a can, while 'crushed tomatoes' is a more
  general term that could encompass both canned and fresh crushed tomatoes. These
  are different enough to warrant separate instances in a class hierarchy.
