text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Pheasant Drumsticks" and
  "Pheasant Meat" are derived from poultry, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  Pheasant Drumsticks refer to a specific cut of poultry meat, whereas Pheasant Meat
  refers to the whole edible part of the pheasant, which can include various cuts
  such as breasts, thighs, and drumsticks. They are related, but not synonymous.
