text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food with distinct properties and uses. Turkey gravy is a sauce made from the juices
  of cooked turkey, while turkey meatballs are a dish made from ground turkey meat
  formed into balls. They serve different purposes in a meal and have different nutritional
  compositions.
