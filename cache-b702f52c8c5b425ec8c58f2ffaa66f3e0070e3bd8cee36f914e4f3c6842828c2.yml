text: No, "Pheasant Drumsticks" and "Pheasant Nuggets" should not be merged together
  as they represent different poultry-derived food products with distinct shapes,
  textures, and possibly preparation methods. While they both come from the same source
  (pheasant), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
