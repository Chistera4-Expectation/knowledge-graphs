text: No, Parboiled Rice and Short-grain Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have distinct
  differences in processing methods and characteristics. Parboiled rice undergoes
  a steaming and drying process before milling, which allows some nutrients from the
  bran layer to be absorbed into the grain. Short-grain rice, on the other hand, has
  a higher starch content and shorter, rounder grains compared to long-grain rice.
  These differences result in distinct cooking properties and culinary uses for each
  type of rice.
