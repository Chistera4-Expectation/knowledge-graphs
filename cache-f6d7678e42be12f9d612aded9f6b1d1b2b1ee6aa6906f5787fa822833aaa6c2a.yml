text: No, European-style Butter and Flavored Butter should not be merged together
  as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. European-style Butter refers
  to a specific type of butter made from cultured cream, while Flavored Butter refers
  to butter that has been mixed with additional ingredients for flavor. They are distinct
  types of butter with different characteristics and uses.
