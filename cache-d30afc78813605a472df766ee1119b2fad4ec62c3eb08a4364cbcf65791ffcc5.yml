text: No, 'Blueberry Honey' and 'Raspberry Honey' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. They are distinct types of honey derived from
  different floral sources, which can affect their taste, texture, and nutritional
  profile. Although they both belong to the Honey class, they are not identical.
