text: No, the instances 'Chicken of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Porcini Mushroom' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible
  mushrooms, they belong to different species with distinct characteristics, appearances,
  and culinary uses. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique properties
  and differences.
