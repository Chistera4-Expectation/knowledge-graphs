text: No, 'Vegetable oil' and 'vegetable stock' should not be merged together as they
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Vegetable oil is a fat extracted from
  plant sources, while vegetable stock is a liquid made by simmering vegetables in
  water, often used as a base for soups and sauces. These two items have different
  properties, uses, and nutritional compositions.
