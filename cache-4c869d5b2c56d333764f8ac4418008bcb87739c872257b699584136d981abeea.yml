text: ' No. Cocoa powder and coconut milk are not duplicates either semantically or
  ontologically. They come from different plants (cacao tree vs. coconut palm), have
  distinct tastes, textures, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking and baking.
  Therefore, they should remain separate entities within the category of edible vegetables.'
