text: As a dietician, I do not have the expertise to determine whether these two instances
  are semantic and ontologic duplicates. However, from a culinary perspective, these
  two infusions have distinct ingredients and flavors, so they would not be considered
  duplicates. They could be categorized as similar tea infusions, but they are not
  duplicates.
