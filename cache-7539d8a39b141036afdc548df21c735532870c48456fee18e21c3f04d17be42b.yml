text: ' No. While "chicken" is a general term that refers to the whole bird, "chicken
  pieces" specifically refer to parts of the chicken, such as breasts, wings, legs,
  etc. Therefore, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates and serve different
  purposes in describing poultry-derived food items.'
