text: ' No, cantaloupe seeds and hemp seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While both are types of seeds, they come from different plants (cantaloupes and
  hemp, respectively) and have distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
