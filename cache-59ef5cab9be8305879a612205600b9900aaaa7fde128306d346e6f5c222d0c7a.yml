  Chicken parmesan is a dish that typically consists of breaded and pan-fried chicken
  topped with tomato sauce and melted cheese, while low-sodium chicken broth is a
  type of broth made by simmering chicken bones and vegetables in water, with reduced
  sodium content. These two items are not semantically or ontologically equivalent,
  as they have different ingredients, preparation methods, and uses. Therefore, there
  is no need to merge them as duplicates.'
