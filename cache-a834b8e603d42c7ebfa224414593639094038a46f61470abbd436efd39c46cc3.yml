  While both Sesame Ginger Dressing and Tahini Dressing share some similarities (e.g.,
  they are both typically creamy dressings), they have distinct ingredients that make
  them unique. Sesame Ginger Dressing usually contains sesame oil, ginger, soy sauce,
  vinegar, sugar, and garlic. On the other hand, Tahini Dressing is primarily made
  from tahini (sesame paste), lemon juice, olive oil, water, salt, and sometimes garlic.
  Merging these two instances would not accurately represent their differences and
  could lead to confusion for users looking for specific dressing options.'
