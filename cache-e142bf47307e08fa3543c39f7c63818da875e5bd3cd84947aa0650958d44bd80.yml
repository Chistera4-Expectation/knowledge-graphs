text: No, Rain Water and Soft Water should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are distinct types of water with different properties and sources.
  Rain Water is water that has fallen as precipitation from the atmosphere, while
  Soft Water is water with low mineral content, often from a water softening process
  or a naturally occurring source. These two types of water have different uses, characteristics,
  and interactions with other substances, making them unique and non-duplicative.
