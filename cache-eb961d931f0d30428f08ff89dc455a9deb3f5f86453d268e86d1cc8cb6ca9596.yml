text: No, Castor Oil and Olive Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates because they are distinct types of edible vegetable oils with different
  chemical compositions, properties, and uses. Castor Oil is derived from the seeds
  of the castor plant (Ricinus communis), while Olive Oil is derived from the fruits
  of the olive tree (Olea europaea). Although they both fall under the category of
  edible vegetable oils, they are unique in their own right.
