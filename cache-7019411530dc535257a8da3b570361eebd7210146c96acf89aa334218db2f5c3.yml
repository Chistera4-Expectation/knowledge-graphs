text: ' No. While poppy seeds and pumpkin seeds are both types of edible seeds, they
  have distinct nutritional profiles, appearances, tastes, textures, and uses in cooking
  and baking. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They each deserve their own unique entries in an "Edible Seeds" class
  with information specific to that type of seed.'
