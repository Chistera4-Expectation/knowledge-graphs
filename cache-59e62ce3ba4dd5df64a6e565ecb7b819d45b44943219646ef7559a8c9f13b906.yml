text: No, the instances 'Duck Liver' and 'Duck' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are distinct food items with different nutritional
  profiles, even though they come from the same animal. Duck liver is typically high
  in fat and cholesterol, while duck meat is leaner and has a different nutrient composition.
