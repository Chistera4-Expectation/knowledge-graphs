text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are poultry-derived nuggets,
  Guinea Fowl and Ostrich are different types of birds, and their nuggets would have
  distinct nutritional profiles and potentially other differences, such as taste and
  texture. Therefore, they should remain separate instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
