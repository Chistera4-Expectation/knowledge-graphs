  While both "Chicken curry" and "Chicken salad" are poultry-derived foods that contain
  chicken, they have different ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates
  from a dietary perspective. They belong to distinct categories of dishes with unique
  characteristics and purposes in various culinary contexts.'
