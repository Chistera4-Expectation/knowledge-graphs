  While both miso paste and pepper can be used as seasonings, they serve different
  purposes and have unique flavors. Miso paste is a fermented soybean paste commonly
  used in Japanese cuisine for its rich umami flavor, while pepper is a spice that
  adds heat and enhances other flavors. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
