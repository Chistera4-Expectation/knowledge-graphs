  While horseradish dressing and ranch dressing may have some similarities (e.g.,
  both are typically creamy), they differ significantly in their ingredients and flavor
  profiles. Horseradish dressing is made with grated horseradish root, vinegar, and
  sometimes mustard, while ranch dressing usually contains buttermilk, mayonnaise,
  sour cream, herbs, and spices. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
