text: No, Chestnut Honey and Tupelo Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are types of honey, they have distinct characteristics,
  flavors, and production processes, which differentiate them from one another. Merging
  them would not accurately represent their unique properties.
