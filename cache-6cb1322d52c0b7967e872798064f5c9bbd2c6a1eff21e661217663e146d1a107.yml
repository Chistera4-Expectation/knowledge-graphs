  While both honey mustard dressing and ranch dressing are types of salad dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients and flavors, so they should not be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Honey mustard dressing typically contains honey, mustard,
  vinegar, oil, and spices, while ranch dressing is usually made with buttermilk,
  mayonnaise, herbs, and spices. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two instances.'
