  While both grapeseed oil and pumpkin seed oil are types of vegetable oils that can
  be used in cooking, they have different nutritional profiles, flavors, and extraction
  processes. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological
  duplicates. It is important to maintain separate listings for each type of oil to
  accurately reflect their unique characteristics and uses.'
