  Graham cracker crumbs and crushed crackers are different types of ingredients, even
  though they may serve similar purposes in some recipes. Graham cracker crumbs specifically
  refer to the ground-up version of graham crackers, while crushed crackers can refer
  to any type of cracker that has been crushed. They have different flavors and textures,
  so they are not exact duplicates.
