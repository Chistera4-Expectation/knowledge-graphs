text: No, 'Sunflower Honey' and 'Tupelo Honey' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they both belong to the Honey class, they are distinct
  types of honey with different properties, flavors, and origins. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the specific characteristics of each honey type.
