  While imitation crab meat is often made to resemble and have a similar texture to
  real crab meat, it is not actually composed of crab but rather fish paste (usually
  pollock) and other ingredients such as egg whites, wheat starch, and flavorings.
  Therefore, from both a semantic and an ontological standpoint, "crabs" and "imitation
  crab meat" are distinct entities that should not be merged into a single concept.'
