text: "No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of sauces, they have\
  \ distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses. B\xE9chamel sauce is a white sauce made\
  \ from a roux and milk, while Satay sauce is typically made from a combination of\
  \ peanuts, spices, and coconut milk. Merging them would not accurately represent\
  \ their differences."
