text: ' No. Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) are root vegetables that belong to the nightshade
  family, while tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) are fruit vegetables also from the
  same family but with different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore,
  they shouldn''t be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
