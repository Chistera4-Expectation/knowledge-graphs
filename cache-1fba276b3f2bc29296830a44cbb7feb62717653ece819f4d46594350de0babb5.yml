text: ' No. Swiss cheese and serving size of cheese are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While "Swiss cheese" is a specific type of cheese, "serving size of
  cheese" refers to the amount of any type of cheese that is typically consumed at
  one time for nutritional purposes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two instances.'
