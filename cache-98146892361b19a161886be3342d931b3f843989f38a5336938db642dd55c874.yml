text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are derived from turkey, they have
  different nutritional compositions and cooking methods. Turkey drumsticks are a
  cut of meat from the leg, while turkey nuggets are processed and shaped from ground
  turkey meat. Their nutritional profiles and preparation methods are different, so
  they should be kept as separate entities within the Poultry-derived Food class.
