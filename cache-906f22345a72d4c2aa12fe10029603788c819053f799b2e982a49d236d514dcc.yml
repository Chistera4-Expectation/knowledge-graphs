text: "No. \n\nAlthough \"Flora tea petals\" and \"Green tea\" are semantically similar,\
  \ they represent different ontological concepts. \n\n* **Flora tea petals** refers\
  \ to the petals of flowers that are used in tea blends. \n* **Green tea** refers\
  \ to a specific type of tea made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant.\n\
  \nTherefore, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates."
