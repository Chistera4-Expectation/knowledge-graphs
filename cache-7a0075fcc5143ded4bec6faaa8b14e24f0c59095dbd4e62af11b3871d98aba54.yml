text: No, they should not be merged together. Boiling water and mineral water have
  different characteristics and purposes, and they serve different roles in a drinking
  water classification. Boiling water is a method of purification, while mineral water
  is a type of water that naturally contains minerals. They are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
