  While both "Maggi seasoning cubes" and "Taco Seasoning" are types of food seasonings,
  they cater to different cuisines and have unique ingredients. Maggi seasoning cubes
  primarily contain salt, MSG (monosodium glutamate), and various flavor enhancers,
  while Taco Seasoning typically includes chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder,
  onion powder, and oregano. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
