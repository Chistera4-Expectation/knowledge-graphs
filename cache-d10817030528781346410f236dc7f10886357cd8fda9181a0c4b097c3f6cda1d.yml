text: No, European-style Butter and Plant-based Butter should not be merged together
  as they are distinct types of butter with different ingredients and nutritional
  profiles. European-style butter typically contains more fat and has a richer taste
  compared to regular butter, while plant-based butter is made from plant-based ingredients
  and is suitable for vegans or those with dairy allergies.
