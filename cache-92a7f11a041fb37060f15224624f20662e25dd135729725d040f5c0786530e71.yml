text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Electrolyte
  water and rainwater have distinct properties and purposes. Electrolyte water contains
  added minerals, such as sodium and potassium, to help replenish electrolytes lost
  during exercise or illness. Rainwater, on the other hand, is naturally occurring
  water that falls from the sky and is often used as a source for drinking or irrigation
  purposes. These two types of water serve different functions and are not duplicates
  in terms of their semantics or ontology.
