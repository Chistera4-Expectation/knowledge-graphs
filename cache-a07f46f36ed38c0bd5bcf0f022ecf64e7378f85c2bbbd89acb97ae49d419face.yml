  However, from a culinary perspective, cardamom pods and green cardamom refer to
  the same spice. They are both the dried fruit of the Elettaria cardamomum plant,
  which is commonly known as green cardamom. So, in terms of culinary usage, they
  can be considered semantic and ontologic duplicates.
