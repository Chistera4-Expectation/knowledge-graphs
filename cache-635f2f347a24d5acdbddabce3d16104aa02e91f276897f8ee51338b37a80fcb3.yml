text: ' No. While Parmesan cheese is a type of cheese, it has specific characteristics
  that distinguish it from other types of cheese. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. It is important to maintain
  the distinction between different types of cheese within a knowledge base or database
  for accuracy and clarity.'
