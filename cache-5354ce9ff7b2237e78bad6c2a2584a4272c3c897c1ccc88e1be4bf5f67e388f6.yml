  While both raw wildflower honey and strawberry honey are types of honey, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different characteristics
  and sources. Raw wildflower honey is made from nectar collected by bees from various
  wildflowers, while strawberry honey is made specifically from the nectar of strawberries.
  Therefore, these two honeys differ in terms of their taste, color, consistency,
  and nutritional content. Merging them as duplicates would result in loss of important
  distinctions that can affect consumer choices and preferences.'
