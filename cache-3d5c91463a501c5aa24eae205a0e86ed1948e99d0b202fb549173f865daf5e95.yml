text: No, the instances 'Juice' and 'Prune juice' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. 'Juice' is a general term for a liquid made by extracting
  the natural liquid contents of fruits and vegetables, while 'Prune juice' is a specific
  type of juice made from prunes. They are related, but not duplicates.
