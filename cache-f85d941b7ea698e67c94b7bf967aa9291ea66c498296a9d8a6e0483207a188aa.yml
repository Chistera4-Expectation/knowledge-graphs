text: ' No. Deep-fried shrimp and fried chicken are not poultry-derived foods, so
  they would not fall under this category to begin with. Moreover, even if we consider
  them within the broader context of fried seafood and fried poultry respectively,
  they still have distinct ingredients (shrimp vs chicken) and nutritional profiles,
  making them non-duplicate entities.'
