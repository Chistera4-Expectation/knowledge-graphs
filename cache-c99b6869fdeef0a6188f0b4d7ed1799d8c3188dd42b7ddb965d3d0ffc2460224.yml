text: ' "Cereal" would be the most adequate class for ''`name` - A string representing
  the name of the cereal'' among the options you provided. This is because the other
  classes, such as Bread, Pasta Types, and Rice, do not typically fall under the category
  of breakfast cereals. By choosing the class of Cereal, you can accurately represent
  the item that `name` refers to.'
