text: No, Mole sauce and Teriyaki sauce should not be merged together as they are
  distinct sauces with different ingredients, flavors, and cultural origins. Mole
  sauce is a complex sauce from Mexican cuisine, often containing chili peppers, nuts,
  seeds, and chocolate, while Teriyaki sauce is a sweet and savory sauce from Japanese
  cuisine, typically made with soy sauce, mirin, and sugar.
