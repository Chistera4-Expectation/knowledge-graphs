text: No, "Vegetable oil" and "Vegetables of your choice" should not be merged together
  as they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Vegetable oil refers to a specific
  type of oil extracted from vegetables, while "Vegetables of your choice" refers
  to a variety of vegetables that can be selected for consumption. They serve different
  purposes and are not interchangeable in the context of a dietician's classification.
