text: ' No. Salted fish and sashimi-grade fish are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They belong to different categories of edible
  fish based on their preparation and consumption methods.


  Salted fish is made by preserving fish through salting and drying, which can significantly
  alter its texture and taste. On the other hand, sashimi-grade fish refers to high-quality
  raw fish that has been properly handled and prepared for eating raw in dishes like
  sushi. Sashimi-grade fish must meet strict requirements regarding freshness, handling,
  and storage to minimize any risk of foodborne illnesses. Therefore, these two types
  of edible fish have distinct characteristics and uses.'
