text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are derived from poultry,
  specifically chicken, they serve different purposes and have different nutritional
  profiles. Chicken nuggets are a processed food item, typically deep-fried, and can
  be high in fat and sodium, whereas chicken/vegetable stock is a broth that can be
  a healthier option for flavoring dishes, and its nutritional content can vary depending
  on the ingredients used.
