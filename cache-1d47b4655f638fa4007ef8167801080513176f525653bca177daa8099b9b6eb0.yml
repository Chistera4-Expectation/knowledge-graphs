text: No, Turkey Soup and Turkey Stock should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they share the same base ingredient (turkey), they are distinct
  types of food with different characteristics and uses. Turkey Soup is a complete
  dish that can be eaten on its own, while Turkey Stock is a cooking ingredient typically
  used as a base for soups, stews, and sauces.
