text: No, Glacier Water and Hydrogen Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct types of drinking water with different
  properties and production methods. Glacier Water refers to water sourced from glaciers,
  which may be naturally filtered and free of contaminants due to the slow movement
  of glaciers. Hydrogen Water, on the other hand, is water that has been infused with
  hydrogen molecules, which can act as an antioxidant and provide potential health
  benefits. While both types of water can be consumed, they have unique characteristics
  that set them apart from each other.
