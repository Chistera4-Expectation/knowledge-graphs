text: No, Palm Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are different types of edible vegetable oils with distinct properties,
  origins, and nutritional profiles. Palm Oil is derived from the fruit of oil palms
  and has a high saturated fat content, while Wheat Germ Oil is extracted from the
  germ of wheat kernels and is rich in polyunsaturated fats, including omega-3 and
  omega-6 fatty acids.
