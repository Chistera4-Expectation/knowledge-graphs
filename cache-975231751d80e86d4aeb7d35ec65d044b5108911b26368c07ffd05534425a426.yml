text: No, 'Infused Water' and 'Rain Water' should not be merged together as they are
  not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Infused Water refers to water that has had
  fruits, herbs, or other flavorings added to it, while Rain Water is simply water
  that has fallen from the sky as precipitation. These are two distinct types of water
  with different properties and uses.
