text: ' No. While both button mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms are edible and belong
  to the kingdom Fungi, they have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional
  profiles, flavors, textures, and culinary uses. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
