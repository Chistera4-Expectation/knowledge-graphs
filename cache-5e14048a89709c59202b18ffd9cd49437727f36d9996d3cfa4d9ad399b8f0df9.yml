  While honey mustard dressing and sesame ginger dressing may have some similarities
  (e.g., both are types of salad dressings), they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Semantically, these two dressings serve different tastes and flavor
  profiles due to their distinct ingredients: honey and mustard versus sesame and
  ginger. Ontologically, they belong to separate categories based on their unique
  compositions, uses, and cultural origins. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them
  as separate instances within the food dressing class.'
