text: As a dietician, I would not recommend merging 'Apple Clove Infusion' and 'Pear
  Cinnamon Infusion' as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they share similarities
  (infusion drinks with fruit and spice combinations), they are distinct flavors and
  may have different nutritional properties based on the specific fruits and spices
  used. Merging them could lead to confusion for consumers and may not accurately
  represent the variety of options available in infusion drinks.
