text: No, 'Sage Honey' and 'Sunflower Honey' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are types of honey, they are derived from
  different plants (sage and sunflower, respectively) and may have distinct flavors,
  nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking or medicine.
