text: No, 'Camel Milk' and 'Soy Milk' should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are different types of milk with distinct nutritional
  profiles and come from different sources (camel vs. soy plant). While they can be
  classified under the broader category of "Milk," they are not duplicates of each
  other.
