  While both Eucalyptus honey and Linden honey are types of honey, they come from
  different plant sources (eucalyptus trees and linden trees, respectively) and have
  distinct flavors, properties, and potentially health benefits. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates, because
  they represent unique subcategories within the broader category of honey.'
