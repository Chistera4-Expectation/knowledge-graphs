  While canola oil and walnut oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they have
  different nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses, so they cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates. Canola oil is low in saturated fat and high
  in monounsaturated fats, making it a popular choice for cooking due to its mild
  flavor and high smoke point. Walnut oil, on the other hand, has a higher concentration
  of polyunsaturated fats (particularly omega-3 fatty acids), but it contains more
  fragile unsaturated fats that make it less suitable for high-heat applications.
  Additionally, walnut oil boasts a rich, distinctive nutty flavor that makes it ideal
  for salad dressings, dips, and drizzling over finished dishes. Therefore, these
  two oils serve unique purposes and cater to diverse culinary needs, thus warranting
  separate classification.'
