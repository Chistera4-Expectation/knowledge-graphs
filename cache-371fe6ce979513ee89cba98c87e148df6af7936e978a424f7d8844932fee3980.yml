text: No, 'Buffalo Milk' and 'Pea Milk' should not be merged together as they are
  different types of milk with distinct properties and origins. 'Buffalo Milk' is
  derived from buffalo, while 'Pea Milk' is a plant-based milk alternative made from
  yellow peas. They serve different dietary needs and preferences, so they should
  be treated as separate entities in a dietary classification system.
