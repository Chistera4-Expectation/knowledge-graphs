text: No, Pheasant Gizzards and Pheasant Meat should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from the same bird species, they
  represent different parts of the bird with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of
  each food item.
