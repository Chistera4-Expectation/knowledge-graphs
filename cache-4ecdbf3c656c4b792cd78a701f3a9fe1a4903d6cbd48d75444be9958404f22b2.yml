text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both belong to the Solanaceae family and are technically chili peppers, they differ
  in taste, heat, and culinary uses. Bell peppers are mild and sweet, while other
  chili peppers vary in heat levels and can be spicy. This distinction is important
  for dietary recommendations and meal planning.
