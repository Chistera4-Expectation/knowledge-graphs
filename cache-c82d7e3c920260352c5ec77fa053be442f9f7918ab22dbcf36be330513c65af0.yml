text: ' No. While daikon radishes and common radishes belong to the same family (Brassicaceae)
  and have similar appearances, they are different varieties of the species Raphanus
  sativus with distinct characteristics, such as size, shape, taste, and cultural
  use. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
