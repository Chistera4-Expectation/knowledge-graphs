  While flaxseed oil and sunflower oil may both fall under the category of edible
  vegetable oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct
  properties, nutritional profiles, and uses, making them separate entities within
  this classification. Flaxseed oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, while sunflower
  oil contains higher amounts of vitamin E and unsaturated fats. Therefore, it would
  be incorrect to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
