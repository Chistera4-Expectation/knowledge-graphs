  Although both 'Ostrich Meatballs' and 'Ostrich Thighs' are poultry-derived food,
  they are different dishes with distinct preparation methods and nutritional profiles.
  'Ostrich Meatballs' are made by combining ground ostrich meat with various ingredients
  to form a ball shape, while 'Ostrich Thighs' are simply the thigh meat of the ostrich,
  typically cooked whole or sliced.
