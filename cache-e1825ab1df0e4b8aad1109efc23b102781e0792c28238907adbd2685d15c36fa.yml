text: No, the instances 'Guinea Fowl Meat' and 'Guinea Fowl Stock' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from the
  same animal, they represent different food products with distinct nutritional properties
  and uses in cooking. Guinea Fowl Meat refers to the meat itself, while Guinea Fowl
  Stock refers to a liquid derived from cooking the bones and connective tissues of
  the bird, which has a different nutritional profile and is used for flavoring dishes.
