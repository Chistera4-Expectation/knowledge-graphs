  The terms "lactose-free milk" and "non-dairy milk" refer to different types of milk
  alternatives, with distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. Lactose-free
  milk is made from cow''s milk that has had the lactose removed, while non-dairy
  milk is made from plant-based sources such as soy, almonds, or oats. Merging them
  as duplicates would not accurately reflect their differences in composition, taste,
  and nutritional content.'
