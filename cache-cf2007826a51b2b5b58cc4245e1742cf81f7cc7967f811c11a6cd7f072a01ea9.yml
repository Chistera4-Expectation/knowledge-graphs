text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both types of water are drinkable and may share some similarities, they are distinct
  in their characteristics and origins. Sparkling water is artificially carbonated,
  while spring-fed water comes from natural underground sources. These differences
  make them separate entities in a water classification system.
