text: ' No. Chili oil and soybean oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they may both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils. While
  soybean oil is an oil extracted from soybeans, chili oil is actually made by infusing
  another type of oil (such as sesame or peanut oil) with crushed red chilies. Therefore,
  these two types of "oils" have different compositions, uses, and nutritional profiles,
  making them distinct entities that should not be merged as duplicates.'
