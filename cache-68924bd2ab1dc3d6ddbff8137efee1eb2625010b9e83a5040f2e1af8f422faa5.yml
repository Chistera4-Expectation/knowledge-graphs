  While "sugar per serving" and "serving size of the cheese" are related concepts,
  they do not represent semantic or ontological duplicates. They provide different
  types of information about a given cheese product: one quantifies the amount of
  sugar present in each serving, while the other specifies how much cheese constitutes
  a single serving. Merging these two properties would result in conflating distinct
  nutritional facts.'
