text: ' No. Diced onions, fried onions, boiled eggs, and nuts are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates, despite all being related to vegetables. They refer to different
  forms of preparation and consumption, each with its own unique nutritional profile
  and use case. Therefore, they should remain separate instances within the Edible
  Vegetable class.'
