text: No, they should not be merged as they have different properties and characteristics.
  Hard water contains high levels of minerals such as calcium and magnesium, while
  purified water has undergone a filtration process to remove impurities and contaminants.
  Although they both refer to drinking water, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates due to their distinct properties and compositions.
