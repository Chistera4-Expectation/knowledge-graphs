  The term "scallop" can refer to two different things:


  * The meat of the scallop shellfish (Pecten maximus), which is commonly used in
  seafood dishes.

  * A cut of veal that has been breaded and fried, also known as "veal scallops".


  While they share a similar name, these are two distinct culinary concepts with different
  ingredients, textures, and flavors. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
