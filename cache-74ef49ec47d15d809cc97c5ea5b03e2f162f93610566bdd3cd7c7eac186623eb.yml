text: No, they should not be merged. Although both turkey sausage and turkey are derived
  from the same source (turkey), they have different nutritional profiles and cooking
  properties. Turkey sausage is processed, and its nutritional content can vary depending
  on the ingredients used, while turkey is a leaner, less processed meat. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
