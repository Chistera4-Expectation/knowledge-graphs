  Cumin seeds and flax seeds are both seeds that are often consumed for their health
  benefits. They are both seeds that are rich in fiber, protein, and omega-3 fatty
  acids. As a dietician, it would be beneficial to merge the instances ''Cumin seeds''
  and ''Flax Seeds'' together as semantic and ontologic duplicates, as they are essentially
  the same food item with different names.'
