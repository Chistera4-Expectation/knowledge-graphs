text: No, 'Challah Bread' and 'Naan Bread' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of bread, they have distinct
  ingredients, cultural origins, and preparation methods. They serve different purposes
  in various cuisines and cannot be considered the same.
