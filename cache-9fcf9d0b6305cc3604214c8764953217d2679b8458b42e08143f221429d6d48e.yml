  While both "Honey" and "Orange Blossom Honey" are types of honey, they cannot be
  considered semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to distinct subcategories
  within the category of honey. "Honey" is a broad term that refers to a sweet substance
  produced by bees from the nectar of flowers while "Orange Blossom Honey" specifically
  refers to honey made primarily from the nectar of orange blossoms. Therefore, each
  instance represents unique and specific information about different kinds of honey.'
