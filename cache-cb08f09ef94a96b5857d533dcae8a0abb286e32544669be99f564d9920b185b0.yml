text: " No.\n\nExtra virgin olive oil and rice bran oil are both types of edible vegetable\
  \ oils but they have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles,\
  \ taste, smoke point, and culinary uses. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge\
  \ them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Here are some key differences between\
  \ the two:\n\n1. Nutritional profile: Extra virgin olive oil is high in monounsaturated\
  \ fats (MUFAs) and contains antioxidants such as vitamin E and K, polyphenols, and\
  \ phytosterols. Rice bran oil, on the other hand, has a more balanced fatty acid\
  \ composition with moderate amounts of MUFAs, polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs), and\
  \ saturated fats. It also contains antioxidant compounds like gamma-oryzanol, tocopherols,\
  \ and tocotrienols.\n2. Taste: Extra virgin olive oil has a strong, distinctive\
  \ flavor that can vary depending on the type of olives used. Rice bran oil has a\
  \ light, neutral flavor that does not interfere with the taste of other ingredients\
  \ in a dish.\n3. Smoke point: The smoke point refers to the temperature at which\
  \ an oil starts breaking down and producing harmful compounds. Extra virgin olive\
  \ oil has a relatively low smoke point (around 375\xB0F - 400\xB0F or 190\xB0C -\
  \ 205\xB0C), while rice bran oil has a higher smoke point (around 450\xB0F or 232\xB0\
  C). This makes rice bran oil a better choice for high-temperature cooking methods\
  \ like deep-frying or stir-frying.\n4. Culinary uses: Due to its unique flavor,\
  \ extra virgin olive oil is often used as a finishing oil, added after cooking to\
  \ enhance the taste of dishes. Its lower smoke point means it may not be suitable\
  \ for certain cooking techniques involving high heat. In contrast, rice bran oil\
  \ is versatile and can be used for various cooking applications, including saut\xE9\
  ing, baking, roasting, and frying.\n\nGiven these significant differences, it would\
  \ not be accurate or useful to consider \"extra virgin olive oil\" and \"rice bran\
  \ oil\" as semantic or ontological duplicates within the context of an Edible Vegetal\
  \ Oil class."
