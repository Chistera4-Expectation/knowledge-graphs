text: No, they should not be merged as they are different food items made from quail.
  Quail Gizzards are a specific part of the quail (the digestive organ), while Quail
  Patties are a processed or formed food item made from ground quail meat. Although
  they are both derived from quail, they serve different culinary purposes and have
  distinct nutritional profiles.
