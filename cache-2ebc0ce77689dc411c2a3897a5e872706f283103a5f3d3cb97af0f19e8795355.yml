  As a dietitian, I can explain that buckwheat honey and sage honey are different
  types of honey with distinct flavors, textures, and potential health benefits. Buckwheat
  honey is made from the nectar of buckwheat flowers and has a darker color and stronger
  flavor than sage honey, which is made from the nectar of sage flowers. Sage honey
  is lighter in color and has a more delicate flavor.


  While both types of honey may share some similarities in terms of their nutritional
  content, they have different characteristics that set them apart. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge them together as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
