text: No, Pheasant Eggs and Pheasant Thighs should not be merged together as they
  are distinct food items derived from different parts of the pheasant. Pheasant Eggs
  are eggs laid by pheasants, while Pheasant Thighs are the thigh meat from a pheasant.
  They have different nutritional profiles and cooking methods.
