  While both "chicken curry" and "chicken tacos" are poultry-derived foods, they cannot
  be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they represent distinct
  dishes with unique ingredients, preparation methods, and cultural origins. Merging
  them would not accurately reflect their differences and could lead to confusion
  for users seeking specific information about these culinary items.'
