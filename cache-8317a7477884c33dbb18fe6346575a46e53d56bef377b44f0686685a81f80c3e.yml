text: ' No. Although grass-fed and pasture-raised beef have similarities, they are
  not identical and do differ in some ways. Grass-fed beef refers specifically to
  animals that eat only grass throughout their lives, while pasture-raised beef can
  come from animals raised on pasture but may also consume grains. Therefore, it is
  important to maintain these distinctions for accurate communication about the production
  methods of beef products.'
