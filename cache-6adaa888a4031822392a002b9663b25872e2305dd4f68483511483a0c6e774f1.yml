text: ' No, Eucalyptus honey and Raspberry honey should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of honey, they come from different
  plant sources (eucalyptus plants vs raspberries) which gives them unique properties
  and flavors. Therefore, they belong to separate categories within the classification
  system for honey.'
