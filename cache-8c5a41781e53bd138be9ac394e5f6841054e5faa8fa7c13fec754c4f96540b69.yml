  While both "hot peppers" and "pepper to taste" may involve the use of pepper, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. "Hot peppers" refers specifically to
  a type of pepper that is spicy due to its capsaicin content, such as jalapenos or
  habaneros. On the other hand, "pepper to taste" is a more general instruction that
  can refer to any type of pepper, including black pepper or bell peppers, depending
  on the individual''s preference. Therefore, these two concepts have different meanings
  and uses in the context of food seasoning.'
