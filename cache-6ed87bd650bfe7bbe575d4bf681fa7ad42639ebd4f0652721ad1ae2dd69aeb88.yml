text: No, "Chicken Gizzards" and "Chicken Patties" should not be merged together as
  they are different parts of the chicken and prepared differently. Chicken Gizzards
  are a muscle found in the digestive tract of the chicken, while Chicken Patties
  are typically made from ground chicken meat and can be formed into various shapes
  and sizes. These two food items have distinct nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses.
