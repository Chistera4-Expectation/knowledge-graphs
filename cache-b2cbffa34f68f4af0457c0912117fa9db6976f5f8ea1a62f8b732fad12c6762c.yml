  While cayenne pepper and white pepper powder are both types of spices, they have
  different flavors, uses, and properties. Cayenne pepper is made from ground dried
  red chili peppers and has a hot, pungent flavor due to its high capsaicin content.
  It is commonly used in various cuisines for added heat and flavor. On the other
  hand, white pepper powder comes from fully ripened berries of Piper nigrum that
  undergo decortication (removal of outer skin) before drying and grinding. White
  pepper has a milder taste compared to cayenne pepper and is often preferred in lighter-colored
  dishes where the color of black pepper would be undesirable. Since these two ingredients
  possess distinct characteristics, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
