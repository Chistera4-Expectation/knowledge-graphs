text: ' No. White pepper powder and habanero peppers are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They belong to the same category (spices), but they have different flavors,
  appearances, uses, and heat levels. Therefore, it is important to maintain them
  as separate entities with distinct attributes.'
