text: ' No, pork fat and pork tenderloin should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from pigs, they have different
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Pork fat is high in calories and saturated
  fats, while pork tenderloin is a leaner cut of meat that contains protein, B vitamins,
  and minerals such as zinc and iron. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate
  categories for these two food items.'
