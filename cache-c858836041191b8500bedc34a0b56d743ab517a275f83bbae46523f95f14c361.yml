text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from chicken, they have different nutritional profiles and preparation
  methods. Chicken broth is a liquid made from simmering chicken bones, meat, and
  vegetables, while chicken meatballs are a solid food made from ground chicken meat
  mixed with other ingredients. Therefore, they should be considered separate instances
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.
