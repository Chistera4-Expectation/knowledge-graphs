text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are derived from chicken, they
  serve different purposes and have distinct nutritional profiles. Chicken stock is
  a liquid base used in cooking, while chicken wings are a specific cut of meat that
  can be cooked and served as a meal or snack. Merging them would result in a loss
  of clarity and specificity in the classification system.
