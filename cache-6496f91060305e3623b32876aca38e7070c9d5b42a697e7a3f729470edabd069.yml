text: No, Chili oil and Pistachio oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are different types of edible vegetable oils with distinct
  flavors, properties, and uses. Chili oil is made from chili peppers and is typically
  used as a condiment for adding heat and flavor to dishes, while Pistachio oil is
  made from pistachios and is often used in salad dressings or as a finishing oil
  for enhancing the flavors of cooked dishes.
