text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are derived from ostriches,
  they are different food items with distinct nutritional profiles and cooking methods.
  Ostrich drumsticks are a cut of meat, while ostrich eggs are a whole food item.
  They should remain separate in the Poultry-derived Food class.
