text: Yes, if 'Chili bean sauce' and 'Chili sauce' have the same or very similar ingredients
  and nutritional values, they can be considered semantic and ontological duplicates
  and could be merged together. However, if there are significant differences in ingredients,
  nutritional values, or usage, it would be best to keep them as separate instances.
