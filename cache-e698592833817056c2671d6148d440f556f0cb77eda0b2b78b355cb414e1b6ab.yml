  While chili peppers and dried red pepper flakes are both forms of spicy seasoning
  that come from certain varieties of peppers, they have distinct differences in form,
  flavor profile, and usage. Chili peppers are whole fruits from various Capsicum
  species, with varying levels of heat and unique flavors based on their specific
  type (e.g., jalapeno, cayenne, habanero). Dried red pepper flakes, however, typically
  consist of crushed, de-seeded, and dried chilies, often comprising multiple types
  of peppers to create a uniformly hot, slightly sweet, and savory blend. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates since
  they represent different culinary ingredients with individual characteristics and
  applications.'
