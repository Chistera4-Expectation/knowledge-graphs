text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of onions, they
  have distinct characteristics and uses. Green onions (also known as scallions) have
  a milder flavor and are typically used in their entirety, including the green tops,
  while sliced onions (such as yellow or white onions) are larger and have a stronger
  flavor, often used for cooking. They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
