text: ' No. Catfish fillets and stock fish are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They belong to different types of edible fish
  with distinct characteristics and uses. Catfish fillets come from catfish, which
  is freshwater or saltwater fish, while stock fish is typically made from air-dried
  codfish. Therefore, they have different nutritional profiles, textures, tastes,
  and culinary applications.'
