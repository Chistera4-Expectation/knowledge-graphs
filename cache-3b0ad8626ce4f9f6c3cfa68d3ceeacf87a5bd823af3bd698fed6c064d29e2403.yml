text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both yellow bell pepper and
  habanero pepper are in the same class (edible vegetables) and both are peppers,
  they have distinct properties and uses. Yellow bell peppers are mild and sweet,
  while habanero peppers are extremely hot and spicy. They should be kept separate
  in a classification system to provide accurate information to users.
