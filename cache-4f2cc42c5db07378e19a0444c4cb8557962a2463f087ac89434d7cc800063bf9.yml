text: ' No. While "Name of the cheese" and "serving size of the cheese" may both provide
  information about a particular type of cheese, they represent different aspects
  of that cheese (its identity and the amount consumed, respectively). Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
