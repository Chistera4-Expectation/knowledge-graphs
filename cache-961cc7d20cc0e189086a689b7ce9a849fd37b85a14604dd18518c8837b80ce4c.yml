text: ' No. Although both noodles and rice vermicelli noodles may seem similar because
  they are long, thin strands of food often used in soups and stir-fries, they have
  different ingredients and nutritional profiles. Noodles are typically made from
  wheat flour, while rice vermicelli noodles are made from rice flour. As such, merging
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates would not accurately reflect their distinct
  properties.'
