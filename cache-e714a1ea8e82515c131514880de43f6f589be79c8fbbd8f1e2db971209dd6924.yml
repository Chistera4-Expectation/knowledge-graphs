text: ' No. While both "Sodium per serving" and "Total fat per serving" provide information
  about the nutritional content of cheese, they measure different aspects of it: one
  measures the amount of sodium, while the other measures the total amount of fat.
  Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates and should remain separate
  properties.'
