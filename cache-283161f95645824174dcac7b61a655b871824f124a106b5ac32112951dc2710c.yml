text: No, Turkey Gravy and Turkey Nuggets should not be merged together as they are
  two distinct food items within the Poultry-derived Food class. Turkey Gravy is a
  sauce made from turkey drippings, while Turkey Nuggets are bite-sized pieces of
  turkey meat. Although both are derived from turkey, they have different uses, preparations,
  and nutritional profiles.
