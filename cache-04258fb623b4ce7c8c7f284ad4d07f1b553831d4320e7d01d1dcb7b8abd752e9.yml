text: No, the instances 'Fish' and 'Monkfish' should not be merged together as they
  represent different types of fish within the Edible Fish class. 'Fish' is a more
  general term, while 'Monkfish' is a specific type of fish. They can coexist within
  the same class without being considered duplicates.
