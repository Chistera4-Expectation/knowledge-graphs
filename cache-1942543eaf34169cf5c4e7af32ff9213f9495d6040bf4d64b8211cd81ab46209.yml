  While sesame seeds and watermelon seeds are both types of edible seeds, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different properties and
  uses. Sesame seeds are small, flat oval seeds with a nutty flavor that can be used
  raw, roasted, or ground into paste. They are high in fiber, calcium, iron, zinc,
  and B vitamins. Watermelon seeds, on the other hand, are larger, more oblong-shaped
  seeds that are often discarded when eating watermelon. However, if they are hulled
  and dried, watermelon seeds can also be eaten as a snack or added to recipes for
  extra protein, magnesium, and healthy fats. Therefore, it is important to keep these
  two types of seeds separate in an Edible Seeds class due to their distinct characteristics
  and applications.'
