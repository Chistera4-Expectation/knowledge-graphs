text: As a dietician, my primary focus is on the nutritional aspects of food and not
  necessarily the technical details of semantic and ontologic duplicates. However,
  from a semantic and ontological perspective, 'Balsamic Vinegar' and 'Vinegar' could
  be considered as related entities rather than exact duplicates. This is because
  Balsamic Vinegar is a specific type of vinegar with its own distinct flavor and
  production process.
