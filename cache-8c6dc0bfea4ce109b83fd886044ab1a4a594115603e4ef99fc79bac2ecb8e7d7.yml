text: No, Chestnut Honey and Clover Honey should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have different characteristics,
  flavors, and sources. Chestnut Honey comes from chestnut tree nectar, while Clover
  Honey comes from clover plant nectar. These differences make them distinct types
  of honey.
