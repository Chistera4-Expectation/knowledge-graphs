text: Yes, from a semantic and ontological perspective, "Tomato" and "Tomatoes" can
  be considered duplicates since they refer to the same vegetable, just in singular
  and plural forms. However, in terms of programming and database design, it may still
  be useful to distinguish between the singular and plural forms for clarity and specificity.
