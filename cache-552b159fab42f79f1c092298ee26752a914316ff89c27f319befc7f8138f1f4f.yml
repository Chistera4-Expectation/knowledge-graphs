text: No, Avocado Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking and other
  applications. Merging them would result in loss of specific information and potentially
  misleading categorization.
