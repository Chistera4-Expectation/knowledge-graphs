text: No, Mineral Water and Rain Water should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  characteristics and origins. Mineral Water contains dissolved minerals, often originating
  from springs or underground sources, while Rain Water is fresh water that falls
  as precipitation. They each have different properties and uses, so they should not
  be merged in a classification system.
