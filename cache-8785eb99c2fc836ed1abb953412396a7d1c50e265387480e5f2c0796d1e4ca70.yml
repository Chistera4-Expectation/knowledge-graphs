text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of pasta with distinct
  characteristics. Lasagna noodles are typically made from wheat flour and are used
  in lasagna dishes, while Shirataki noodles are made from konjac yam and are low
  in calories, making them suitable for various types of dishes, including those for
  individuals on low-carb diets.
