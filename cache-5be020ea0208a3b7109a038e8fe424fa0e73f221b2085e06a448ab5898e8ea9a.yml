text: As a dietician, my focus is on nutrition and food rather than programming or
  data modeling. However, from a general perspective, if 'Marinara sauce' is a specific
  type of 'Sauce' and they share the same attributes and properties, it would be reasonable
  to merge them as semantic and ontologic duplicates to reduce redundancy and improve
  data consistency. This would depend on the specific context and requirements of
  the Sauce class in your programming environment.
