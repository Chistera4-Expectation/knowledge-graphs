text: As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on this. Merging 'Barbecue sauce'
  and 'Sauce' as semantic and ontologic duplicates in a Sauce class might not be the
  most accurate approach. 'Barbecue sauce' is a specific type of sauce, while 'Sauce'
  is a more general term that encompasses various types of sauces. Therefore, it would
  be better to keep them as separate instances within the Sauce class to maintain
  the distinction between specific and general sauce types.
