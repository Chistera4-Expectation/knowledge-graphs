text: No, Chili oil and Palm oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct characteristics,
  uses, and production methods. Chili oil is made from chili peppers and typically
  used as a condiment, while palm oil is derived from the fruit of oil palms and is
  widely used in cooking, cosmetics, and biofuel production.
