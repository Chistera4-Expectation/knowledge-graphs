text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of juices, they are distinct
  in terms of their ingredients and nutritional content. Orange juice is made from
  oranges, while vegetable juice can be made from a variety of vegetables. These differences
  in ingredients result in different nutritional profiles and health benefits. Therefore,
  they should be considered separate instances in the Juice class.
