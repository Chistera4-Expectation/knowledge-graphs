  While buttermilk is a dairy product that is related to milk, it is not a duplicate
  of regular milk. Buttermilk is the liquid left over after churning butter from cultured
  cream, making it distinct both semantically and ontologically from regular milk,
  which is an unprocessed fluid secreted by mammals for nursing their young.'
