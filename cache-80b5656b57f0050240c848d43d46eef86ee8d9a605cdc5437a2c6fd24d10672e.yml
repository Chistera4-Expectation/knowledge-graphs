text: No, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Peanut Oil should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the category of edible vegetable
  oils, they are distinct types of oils with different properties, flavors, and uses.
  Merging them would not accurately reflect their unique characteristics and could
  cause confusion for those seeking information about these specific oils.
