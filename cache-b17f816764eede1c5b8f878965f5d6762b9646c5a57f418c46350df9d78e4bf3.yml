text: No, Chanterelle Mushroom and Porcini Mushroom should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of edible mushrooms, they
  have distinct characteristics, flavors, and uses in cooking. Maintaining them as
  separate instances allows for more accurate information about each type of mushroom.
