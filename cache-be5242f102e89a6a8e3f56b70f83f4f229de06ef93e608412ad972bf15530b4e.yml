text: No, Brussels sprouts and mini spring rolls should not be merged together as
  they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Brussels sprouts are a type of cruciferous
  vegetable, while mini spring rolls are a type of appetizer that can contain various
  ingredients, including vegetables, but are not a vegetable themselves.
