text: "No, they should not be merged as they are distinct sauces with different ingredients\
  \ and uses. B\xE9chamel sauce is a white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk,\
  \ while Tartar sauce is a cold sauce made from mayonnaise, chopped pickles, and\
  \ capers. Although they may share some similarities, they are not duplicates."
