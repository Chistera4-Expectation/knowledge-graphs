text: No, the instances 'Artisanal Water' and 'Purified Water' should not be merged
  together as they have distinct characteristics. Artisanal water refers to water
  that is sourced from natural springs or wells and is often bottled without undergoing
  any purification processes. On the other hand, purified water goes through a filtration
  process to remove impurities and contaminants, resulting in a higher level of purity.
  While both are types of drinking water, their production methods and characteristics
  differ significantly.
