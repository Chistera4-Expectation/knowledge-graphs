text: 'As a dietician, I can provide insights on the nutritional aspects of these
  teas, but I am not an expert in semantic and ontologic analysis. However, from a
  nutritional standpoint, ''Lavender Tea'' and ''Lemon Tea'' have different compositions
  and properties. Lavender tea is known for its calming effects and potential benefits
  for sleep, while lemon tea is often consumed for its vitamin C content and potential
  digestive benefits. Therefore, they are not nutritionally equivalent.


  In terms of semantic and ontologic duplicates, I recommend consulting a computer
  science or data science expert for a more informed answer. However, if we consider
  the names and properties of these teas, they could be considered as distinct entities
  due to their different nutritional profiles.'
