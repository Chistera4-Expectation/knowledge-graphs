text: No, Pistachio Oil and Pumpkin Seed Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they are derived
  from different sources (pistachios and pumpkin seeds, respectively) and have distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and uses. They should be treated as separate instances
  within the Edible Vegetal Oil class.
