text: 'No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are types of olive oil, they have distinct properties and production processes.


  Extra Virgin Olive Oil is the highest quality olive oil and is made from pure, cold-pressed
  olives. It has a more robust flavor and contains higher levels of antioxidants and
  healthy fats compared to regular Olive Oil.


  Olive Oil, on the other hand, is a blend of refined and virgin olive oils. It has
  a lighter flavor and is often used for cooking due to its higher smoke point.


  Merging these two types of olive oil would not accurately represent the differences
  in their characteristics and uses.'
