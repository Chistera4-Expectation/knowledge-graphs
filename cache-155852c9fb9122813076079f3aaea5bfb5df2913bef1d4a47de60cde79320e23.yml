  While both Blueberry Honey and Raspberry Honey are types of honey, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct characteristics that
  differentiate them from one another. Specifically, Blueberry Honey is made by bees
  that collect nectar primarily from blueberry flowers, while Raspberry Honey is made
  by bees that collect nectar primarily from raspberry flowers. These differences
  can affect the flavor, color, aroma, and nutritional profile of each type of honey.
  Therefore, it is important to maintain separate categories for these unique varieties
  of honey.'
