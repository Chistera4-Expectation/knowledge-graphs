text: No, Almond milk and Whole milk should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are different types of milk with distinct nutritional
  properties, production methods, and uses. Almond milk is a plant-based milk alternative
  made from almonds, while whole milk is a dairy product derived from cows.
