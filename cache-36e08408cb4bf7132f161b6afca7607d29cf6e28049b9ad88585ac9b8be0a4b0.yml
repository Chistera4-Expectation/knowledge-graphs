text: No, Jasmine Rice and Parboiled Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are two distinct types of rice with different properties, cooking
  methods, and cultural significance. Jasmine Rice is a long-grain variety with a
  fragrant aroma and is commonly used in Southeast Asian cuisine, while Parboiled
  Rice undergoes a pre-cooking process that makes it easier to digest and helps retain
  more nutrients. Merging them as duplicates would not accurately represent the differences
  between these two rice types.
