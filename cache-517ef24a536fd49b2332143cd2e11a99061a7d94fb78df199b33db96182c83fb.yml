text: No, they should not be merged as they are different poultry-derived food items.
  Pheasant Gizzards refer to the digestive organ of the pheasant bird, while Pheasant
  Meatballs are a dish made from ground pheasant meat mixed with other ingredients
  and shaped into balls. Although both are derived from pheasant, they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional compositions and culinary uses.
