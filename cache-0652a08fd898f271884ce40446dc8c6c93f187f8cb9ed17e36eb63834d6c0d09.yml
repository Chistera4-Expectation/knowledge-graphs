text: No, the instances 'Stock' and 'vegetable stock' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are related to edible vegetable,
  they have distinct meanings. 'Stock' is a more general term referring to a liquid
  in which meat or vegetables have been simmered to extract their flavor, while 'vegetable
  stock' specifically refers to a stock made from simmering vegetables. They are not
  duplicates but rather different concepts within the same domain.
