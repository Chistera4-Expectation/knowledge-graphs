text: No, 'Grapefruit juice' and 'Tomato juice' are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Although both are juices, they are distinct types of juice made from different fruits,
  each with unique nutritional properties and characteristics. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the variety of juices available and would not be helpful
  for dietary advice or recommendations.
