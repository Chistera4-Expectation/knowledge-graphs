  While chicken breast is a poultry product that can be used to make chicken tacos,
  they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. Chicken breast refers specifically
  to the lean muscle found on the underside of a chicken, while chicken tacos refer
  to a dish made with various ingredients including chicken breast, tortillas, salsa,
  cheese, etc. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts
  as they represent different food items.'
