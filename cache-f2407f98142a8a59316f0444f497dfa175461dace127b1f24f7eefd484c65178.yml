text: No, Argan oil and Canola oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different chemical
  compositions, nutritional profiles, and uses. Argan oil comes from the argan tree,
  primarily found in Morocco, and is rich in vitamin E and antioxidants, making it
  popular in cosmetics and culinary applications. Canola oil, on the other hand, comes
  from the rapeseed plant and is lower in saturated fat, making it a popular choice
  for cooking and baking.
