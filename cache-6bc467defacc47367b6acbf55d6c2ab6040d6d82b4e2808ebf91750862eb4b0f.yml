text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct spices with different flavors,
  uses, and appearances. Coriander powder is made from ground coriander seeds, while
  Kashmiri chili powder is made from ground Kashmiri chilies, which are known for
  their vibrant red color and mild heat. Although they may both be considered as spices
  in the 'Spice' class, they serve different purposes in cooking and have unique characteristics.
