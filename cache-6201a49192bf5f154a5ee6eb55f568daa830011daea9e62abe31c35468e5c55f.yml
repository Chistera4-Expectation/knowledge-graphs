  Chai tea and Rooibos tea are two different types of teas with distinct ingredients,
  flavors, and nutritional profiles. Chai tea is a spiced tea that typically includes
  black tea, milk, sugar, and spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger, while
  Rooibos tea is a caffeine-free herbal tea made from the leaves of the Rooibos plant,
  which is native to South Africa.


  Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
