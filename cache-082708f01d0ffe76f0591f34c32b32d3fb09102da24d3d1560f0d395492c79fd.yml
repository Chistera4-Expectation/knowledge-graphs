  While both "chicken breast" and "grilled chicken" are related to poultry, they do
  not refer to the same thing. Chicken breast is a specific cut of meat from a chicken,
  while grilled chicken refers to a cooking method that can be applied to various
  cuts of chicken (including chicken breast). Therefore, these two instances should
  not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
