  While cholesterol and saturated fat are related to each other in terms of their
  impact on heart health, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Cholesterol
  is a type of lipid found in animal products that plays an important role in many
  bodily functions, while saturated fat is a specific type of fatty acid found primarily
  in animal products (such as cheese) and some plant-based foods (such as coconut
  oil). Both have been linked to increased levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol and heart
  disease risk when consumed in excess, but they represent distinct nutritional components
  with different chemical structures and roles in the body. Therefore, it is appropriate
  for them to be tracked separately in a cheese class from a dietary perspective.'
