text: No, Black pepper and Red chili peppers should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are spices, they have distinct flavors,
  culinary uses, and nutritional profiles. Black pepper is a dried fruit of the Piper
  nigrum plant, while Red chili peppers are the fruits of plants from the genus Capsicum.
  Keeping them separate allows for more accurate nutritional and culinary information.
