text: ' No. Fireweed honey and Linden honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They come from different
  flower sources (fireweed vs linden), which gives them unique flavors, colors, and
  properties. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between these two types of
  honey rather than merging them.'
