  While both "chicken tacos" and "fried chicken" are poultry-derived foods that contain
  chicken, they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they
  differ significantly in their ingredients, preparation methods, nutritional profiles,
  cultural associations, and consumption contexts. Merging them would result in loss
  of essential distinctions between these two dishes.'
