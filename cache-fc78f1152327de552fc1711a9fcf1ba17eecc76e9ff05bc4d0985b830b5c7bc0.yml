  While chicken breasts can be an ingredient in chicken parmesan, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they refer to different things. Chicken breasts
  specifically refer to the breast meat of a chicken, while chicken parmesan is a
  dish that typically includes breaded chicken breast, tomato sauce, and melted cheese.'
