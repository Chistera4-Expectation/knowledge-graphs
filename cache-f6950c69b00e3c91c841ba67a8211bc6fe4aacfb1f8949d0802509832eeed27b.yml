text: No, the instances 'Mantis Shrimp' and 'Shrimp' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are crustaceans, they belong to
  different families and have distinct characteristics. Mantis shrimp (Order Stomatopoda)
  are predatory and typically have large, powerful claws for capturing prey, while
  shrimp (Order Decapoda, suborder Dendrobranchiata or Pleocyemata) are primarily
  filter feeders or scavengers and have smaller, less specialized claws. Merging them
  together would be inaccurate and misleading.
