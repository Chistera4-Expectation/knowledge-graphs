text: No, Argan Oil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible vegetal oils, they have distinct
  properties, origins, and uses. Argan Oil is primarily produced from the kernels
  of the argan tree, which is native to Morocco, while Extra Virgin Olive Oil comes
  from the fruit of the olive tree, cultivated in various regions around the Mediterranean.
  These differences in origin, production, and characteristics make them unique and
  distinct oils with different nutritional profiles and applications in cooking and
  other uses.
