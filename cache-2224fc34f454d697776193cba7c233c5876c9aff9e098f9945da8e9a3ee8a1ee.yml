  While brown rice and idli rice may seem similar because they are both types of rice,
  they have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Brown rice is whole
  grain rice that has been minimally processed, retaining its bran layer and germ,
  which makes it more nutritious than white rice. It contains higher amounts of fiber,
  protein, B vitamins, iron, magnesium, and other minerals. On the other hand, idli
  rice (also known as parboiled rice) is partially boiled in its husk before being
  milled, making it easier to digest and cook faster than regular raw rice. However,
  it has fewer nutrients compared to brown rice due to the milling process. Therefore,
  from a semantic and ontological perspective, brown rice and idli rice cannot be
  considered duplicates, as they refer to distinct varieties of rice with unique characteristics.'
