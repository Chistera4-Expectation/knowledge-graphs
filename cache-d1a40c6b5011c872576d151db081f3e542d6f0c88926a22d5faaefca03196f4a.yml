text: No, "Chicken Soup" and "Chicken" should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although both are poultry-derived foods, they are distinct food items
  with different nutritional values and preparation methods. Chicken is a meat, while
  Chicken Soup is a liquid dish containing chicken meat and other ingredients. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the differences between the two.
