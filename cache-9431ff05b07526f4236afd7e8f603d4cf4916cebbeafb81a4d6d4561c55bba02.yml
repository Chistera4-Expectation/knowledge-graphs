text: No, Chicken Breast and Chicken Tenders should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both derived from poultry (chicken),
  they are distinct cuts of meat with different nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses. Chicken Breast is a leaner cut with less fat and calories compared to Chicken
  Tenders. Merging them would obscure these important differences.
