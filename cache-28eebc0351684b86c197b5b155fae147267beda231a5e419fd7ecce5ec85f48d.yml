  While both "dipping sauce" and "sauces" are related to culinary applications, they
  do not represent duplicate concepts and should not be merged from a semantic or
  ontological standpoint. "Sauces" is a broader category that encompasses various
  types of liquid or semi-liquid mixtures used for flavoring or enhancing food, while
  "dipping sauces" specifically refers to a subset of sauces intended for dunking
  foods into before consumption. Therefore, it would be appropriate to maintain them
  as separate entities within your classification system.'
