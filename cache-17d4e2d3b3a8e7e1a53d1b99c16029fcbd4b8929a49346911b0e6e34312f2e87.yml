  Acacia honey and strawberry honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates. While
  they may both fall under the category of "honey," they have distinct characteristics
  that set them apart from one another. Acacia honey is made primarily from the nectar
  of acacia flowers, resulting in a light-colored, mildly flavored honey with high
  fructose content. Strawberry honey, on the other hand, is made from the nectar of
  various types of wildflowers, often including clover and alfalfa, giving it a darker
  color and stronger flavor profile compared to acacia honey. Therefore, these two
  varieties of honey should not be merged as duplicates since they possess unique
  properties and originate from different botanical sources.'
