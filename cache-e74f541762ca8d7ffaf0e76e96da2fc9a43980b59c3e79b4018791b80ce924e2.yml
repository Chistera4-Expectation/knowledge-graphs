text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are meatballs derived from poultry, they come from different species and have distinct
  characteristics, such as taste, nutritional content, and cultural associations.
  Therefore, they should be kept as separate instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
