text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are derived from chicken, they have distinct differences in terms of nutritional
  content and culinary use. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are a leaner option
  with a higher protein-to-fat ratio, while chicken tenders have more fat and are
  often coated or breaded, which can significantly change their nutritional profile.
