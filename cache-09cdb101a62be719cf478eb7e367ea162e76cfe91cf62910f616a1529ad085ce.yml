  While both "Greek Seasoning" and "Seasoning Cubes" may seem similar because they
  are used to add flavor to food, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  of one another. Greek seasoning is typically a blend of herbs such as oregano, thyme,
  rosemary, and marjoram that is commonly used in Mediterranean cuisine, while seasoning
  cubes (such as bouillon cubes) contain dehydrated vegetables, meat stock, and spices,
  often compressed into a cube form for easy use in cooking. They have different ingredients,
  uses, and cultural origins, so it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
