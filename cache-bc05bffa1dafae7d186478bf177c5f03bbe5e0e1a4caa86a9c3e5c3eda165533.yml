text: ' No. Game meats and processed meats are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They belong to different categories of poultry-derived
  food with distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles.


  Game meats refer to meat from wild animals that are hunted for food, such as venison
  (deer), boar, rabbit, and quail. These types of meat tend to have lower fat content
  compared to domesticated animal meats due to their natural habitat and physical
  activity levels.


  On the other hand, processed meats involve altering raw meat through various methods
  like salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or adding preservatives. Examples include
  bacon, sausages, hot dogs, ham, and deli meats. Processed meats often contain higher
  amounts of sodium, saturated fats, nitrites, and additives than unprocessed meats.
  Therefore, they carry additional health concerns when consumed excessively, including
  increased risks of cancer, heart disease, and high blood pressure.


  Since game meats and processed meats differ significantly in terms of origin, production
  process, nutritional values, and associated health impacts, it is essential to maintain
  them as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.'
