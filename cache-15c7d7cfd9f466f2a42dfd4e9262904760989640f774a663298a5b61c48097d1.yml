  While both pork ribs and roasted pork are types of pork dishes, they have different
  cuts of meat, preparation methods, textures, flavors, and nutritional profiles.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates
  from a dietary perspective. It is essential to maintain their distinct categorizations
  for accurate food tracking, meal planning, and nutrition analysis purposes.'
