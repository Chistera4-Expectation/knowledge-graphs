  While both Frank''s RedHot Sauce and soy sauce are types of condiments used to add
  flavor to food, they have different ingredients, flavors, and uses. Therefore, it
  would not be accurate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Frank''s RedHot Sauce is a type of hot sauce made primarily from aged cayenne red
  peppers, vinegar, water, salt, garlic powder, and natural flavors. It has a tangy
  and spicy flavor that can range from mild to very hot depending on the specific
  product variation. This sauce is often used as a finishing ingredient for dishes
  such as wings, nachos, chili, and soups.


  On the other hand, soy sauce is a liquid seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans
  with roasted grains (usually wheat) and allowing the mixture to age over several
  months. The result is a salty and umami-rich condiment commonly used in Asian cuisine.
  There are various types of soy sauces, including light, dark, and sweet varieties,
  each having unique characteristics based on their production methods and regional
  variations. Soy sauce is typically added during cooking or marinating processes
  rather than at the table as a final touch like hot sauce.'
