text: ' No. While feta and mozzarella are both types of cheese, they have distinct
  characteristics and uses that make them non-duplicative in terms of their semantics
  and ontology. Feta is a brined curd cheese typically made from sheep''s milk or
  a mixture of sheep and goat''s milk, while mozzarella is a semi-soft cheese originally
  made from Italian buffalo''s milk but now often made from cow''s milk. These differences
  in composition, texture, taste, and production methods justify keeping them separate
  as individual classes or instances within a cheese hierarchy.'
