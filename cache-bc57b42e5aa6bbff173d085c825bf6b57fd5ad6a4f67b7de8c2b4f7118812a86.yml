text: As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on the food aspect, but I'm not
  an expert in semantics or ontology. From a food perspective, "Swiss cheese" and
  "Swiss" can be considered as related but not necessarily duplicates. Swiss cheese
  refers specifically to a type of cheese originating from Switzerland, while "Swiss"
  can also refer to other cheeses from Switzerland or cheeses made in other countries
  using the Swiss cheese-making process. However, merging them as duplicates would
  not be accurate, as they have distinct differences in terms of cheese varieties
  and production methods.
