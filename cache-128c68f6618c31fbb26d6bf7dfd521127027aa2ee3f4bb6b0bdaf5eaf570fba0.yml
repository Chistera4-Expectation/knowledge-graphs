  While both "chicken salad" and "fried chicken" are poultry-derived foods that contain
  chicken, they have different preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Chicken
  salad typically consists of cooked chicken mixed with mayonnaise, vegetables, and
  seasonings, while fried chicken involves breading and deep-frying chicken pieces.
  These differences result in distinct tastes, textures, and nutritional content.'
