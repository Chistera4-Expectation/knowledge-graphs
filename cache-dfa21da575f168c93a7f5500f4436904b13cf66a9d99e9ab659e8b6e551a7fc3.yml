text: ' ''Edible Fish'' would be the most adequate class for Swordfish. This is because,
  as its name suggests, swordfish are indeed a type of fish. On the other hand, edible
  crustaceans and mollusks are groups that include animals such as shrimp, lobsters,
  clams, oysters, and scallops, which are quite different from swordfish in terms
  of their biology, anatomy, and nutritional profiles. So if we were to categorize
  swordfish based on what it is, rather than what can be eaten, then "Fish" or "Edible
  Fish" would be the most appropriate classification.'
