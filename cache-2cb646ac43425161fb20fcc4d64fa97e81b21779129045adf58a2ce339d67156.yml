text: No, 'Pheasant Wings' and 'Turkey Wings' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of poultry wings, they come
  from different bird species and have distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, and
  cooking properties. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
