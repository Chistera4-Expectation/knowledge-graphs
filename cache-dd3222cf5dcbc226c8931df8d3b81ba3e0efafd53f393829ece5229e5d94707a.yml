text: No, Cayenne Pepper and Fennel Seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates because they are two distinct spices with different flavors
  and uses in cooking. While they are both spices and used for seasoning, they have
  unique characteristics that differentiate them from each other.
