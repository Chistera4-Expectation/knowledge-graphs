text: ' No. Catfish fillets and catfish are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  because they refer to different cuts of the same fish species. While both terms
  relate to the same type of fish (Ictaluridae family), "catfish" typically refers
  to the whole animal, while "catfish fillets" specifically indicate boneless pieces
  cut from the body of the fish. Therefore, it is essential to maintain these distinctions
  for accurate labeling and communication regarding food products.'
