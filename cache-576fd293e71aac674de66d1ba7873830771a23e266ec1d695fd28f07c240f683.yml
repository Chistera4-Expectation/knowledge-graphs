text: No, Coconut Oil and Safflower Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different nutritional
  profiles, fatty acid compositions, and uses in cooking and other applications. Merging
  them together would not accurately represent their individual properties and uses.
