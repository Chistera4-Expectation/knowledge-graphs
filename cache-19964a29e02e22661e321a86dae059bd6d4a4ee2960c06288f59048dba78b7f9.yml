text: ' No. Avocado oil and walnut oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they belong to the same category of edible vegetable oils. They come
  from different plant sources (avocados vs. walnuts) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate
  entries with unique properties and characteristics.'
