text: ' No. Although both cholesterol and trans fat are related to health and nutrition,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different chemical
  structures, sources, and impacts on the body. Cholesterol is a steroid lipid that
  your liver produces naturally and is essential for various bodily functions; however,
  high levels of dietary cholesterol can contribute to heart disease. Trans fats,
  also known as trans-fatty acids, are unsaturated fats that can occur naturally in
  some animal products but are primarily produced industrially through partial hydrogenation
  of vegetable oils. Dietary trans fats have been linked to increased risks of cardiovascular
  diseases due to their effects on LDL (bad) cholesterol and HDL (good) cholesterol
  ratios. Keeping these two properties separate allows for more accurate tracking
  and understanding of each nutrient''s impact on health.'
