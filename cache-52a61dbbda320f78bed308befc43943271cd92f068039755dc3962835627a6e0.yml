  The instances "Sliced tomatoes" and "Tomato puree" are not duplicate entries. They
  represent two different forms of tomatoes with distinct textures, flavors, and uses
  in cooking. Sliced tomatoes are solid pieces of tomato that have been cut into thin
  slices, while tomato puree is a smooth, blended mixture made from cooked tomatoes.
  These differences make them distinct entities in the Edible Vegetable class, and
  they should not be merged as duplicates.'
