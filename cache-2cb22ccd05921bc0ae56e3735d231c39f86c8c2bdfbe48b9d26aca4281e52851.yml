  While both pieces of information are related to the nutritional content of the juice,
  they serve different purposes and provide distinct information for consumers. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  The amount of sugar in the juice per serving is important for individuals who need
  to monitor their sugar intake due to health conditions such as diabetes, while the
  quantity of juice in the container helps shoppers understand how much they will
  get for their purchase. Keeping these two facts separate allows users to quickly
  access and compare this relevant information across multiple products.'
