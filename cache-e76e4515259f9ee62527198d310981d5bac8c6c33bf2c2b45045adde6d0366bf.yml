  While both grilled chicken and turkey are types of poultry that can have similar
  nutritional profiles, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They refer
  to different specific food items with distinct tastes, textures, and culinary uses.
  Grilled chicken specifically refers to chicken meat that has been cooked on a grill,
  while turkey is a broader category of bird that includes multiple varieties and
  preparations, one of which may resemble chicken. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances.'
