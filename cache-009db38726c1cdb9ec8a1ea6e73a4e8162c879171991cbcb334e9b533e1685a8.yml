  While "coffee" and "strong coffee" may seem similar, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they refer to different concepts with distinct properties. "Coffee"
  is a general term that refers to a drink made from roasted coffee beans, while "strong
  coffee" has a specific meaning indicating a higher concentration of coffee solids
  or caffeine content compared to regular coffee. Therefore, it would be incorrect
  to merge them as duplicates.'
