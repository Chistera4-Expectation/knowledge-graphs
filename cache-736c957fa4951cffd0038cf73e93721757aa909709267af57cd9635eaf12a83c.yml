text: No, 'Infused Water' and 'Mineral Water' should not be merged together as they
  have distinct characteristics and properties. Infused Water typically refers to
  water that has been flavored with fruits, herbs, or other natural ingredients, while
  Mineral Water is naturally occurring water that contains various minerals and is
  bottled at the source. Although both are types of water, they serve different purposes
  and have unique compositions.
