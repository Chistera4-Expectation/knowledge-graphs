text: No, Assam Tea and Rooibos Tea should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of tea, they come from different
  plants and have distinct characteristics, flavors, and origins. Assam Tea is a black
  tea from the Assam region in India, while Rooibos Tea is a herbal tea from the Rooibos
  plant in South Africa. They should be treated as separate instances in a tea class.
