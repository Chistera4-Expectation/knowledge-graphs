text: ' The most adequate class for peppers would be "Edible Vegetables." Peppers
  are botanical fruits, but in culinary terms they are typically classified as vegetables
  due to their savory flavor and use in main dishes. They belong to the nightshade
  family (Solanaceae) and are native to Central and South America. There are many
  different varieties of peppers including bell peppers, jalapenos, and chili peppers,
  each with its own unique taste, texture, and level of spiciness.'
