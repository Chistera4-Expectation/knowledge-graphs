text: As a dietician, my answer is based on the nutritional and culinary aspects of
  these two types of mushrooms. While both 'Mushrooms' and 'Velvet Pioppini Mushroom'
  are edible mushrooms, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have
  distinct characteristics, flavors, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, they should
  not be merged together.
