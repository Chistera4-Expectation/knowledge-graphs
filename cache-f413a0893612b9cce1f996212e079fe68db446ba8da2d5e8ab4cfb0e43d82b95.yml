text: No, Sparkling Water and Spring Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of drinking water, they
  have different properties and sources. Sparkling Water is carbonated water, while
  Spring Water is naturally sourced from an underground spring. They serve different
  purposes and have distinct characteristics.
