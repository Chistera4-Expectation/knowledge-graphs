text: No, Ceylon Tea and Herbal Tea should not be merged together as they belong to
  different categories. Ceylon Tea is a type of black tea from Sri Lanka, while Herbal
  Tea is an infusion of herbs, fruits, and other plant materials, not derived from
  the tea plant. They have different characteristics, flavors, and uses.
