text: No, Forbidden Rice and Red Rice should not be merged together as they are not
  exact duplicates. Although they may share some similarities, they have distinct
  properties and differences. Forbidden Rice, also known as Black Rice, has a deep
  purple color and is rich in antioxidants. Red Rice, on the other hand, has a reddish-brown
  color and is typically higher in fiber. They also differ in their culinary uses
  and cultural significance.
