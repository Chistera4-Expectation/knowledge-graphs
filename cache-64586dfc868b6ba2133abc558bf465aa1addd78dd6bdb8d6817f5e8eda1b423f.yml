text: No, Pistachio Oil and Walnut Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates because they are derived from different types of nuts and have distinct
  nutritional profiles and flavor characteristics. Although they belong to the same
  class of edible vegetal oils, they are unique and should be treated as separate
  entities.
