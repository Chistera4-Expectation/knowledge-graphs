text: No, 'Soft Water' and 'Sparkling Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  properties and characteristics. Soft water refers to water with low mineral content,
  while sparkling water is carbonated and contains dissolved carbon dioxide gas. These
  differences in properties make them separate entities in terms of semantics and
  ontology.
