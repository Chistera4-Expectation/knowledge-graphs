text: No, the instances 'Black Trumpet Mushroom' and 'Enoki mushrooms' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct species
  of edible mushrooms with different characteristics, appearances, and culinary uses.
  Black Trumpet Mushrooms (Craterellus cornucopioides) are trumpet-shaped with a dark
  brown to black color, while Enoki mushrooms (Flammulina velutipes) are long and
  thin with a white to light brown color. They are not duplicates in terms of their
  identity or properties.
