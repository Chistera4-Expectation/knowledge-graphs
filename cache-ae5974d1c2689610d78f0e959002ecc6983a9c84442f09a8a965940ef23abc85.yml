  Peanut oil and Safflower oil are different oils with distinct nutritional profiles.
  While they are both vegetable oils, they have different fatty acid compositions,
  calorie counts, and health benefits. Merging them together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates would not accurately reflect the unique characteristics of each oil.'
