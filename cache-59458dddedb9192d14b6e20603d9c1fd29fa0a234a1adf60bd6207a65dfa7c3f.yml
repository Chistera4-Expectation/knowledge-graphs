text: ' "Juice" or "Water (enhanced with vitamins)" would be the most appropriate
  classes for Vitamin Water. However, it is essential to note that not all types of
  Vitamin Water fall under these categories as some may contain added sugars and caffeine,
  making them more similar to Energy Drinks or Alcoholic Beverages depending on their
  formulation. Always check the label to ensure you are consuming the healthiest option
  possible.'
