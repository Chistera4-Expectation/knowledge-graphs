text: No, Catfish and Redfish should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates
  in the Edible Fish class. Although they are both fish species, they have distinct
  characteristics, appearances, habitats, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, they
  should be treated as separate instances within the Edible Fish class.
