text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Pheasant Broth' and 'Pheasant
  Sausage' are derived from poultry, they are distinct types of food with different
  nutritional profiles and preparation methods. Merging them together would not accurately
  represent the differences between these two items in a food classification system.
