text: ' No. Blackberry honey and eucalyptus honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they come from different plant sources (blackberries vs eucalyptus)
  and have distinct flavor profiles, nutritional properties, and uses in cooking and
  baking. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate categories for accurate
  identification and application.'
