text: "No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both\
  \ are types of edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties, uses, and nutritional\
  \ profiles. Cooking oil is typically used for frying, saut\xE9ing, and baking, whereas\
  \ hemp seed oil is often used for salad dressings, drizzling over cooked dishes,\
  \ or as a dietary supplement due to its high nutritional value."
