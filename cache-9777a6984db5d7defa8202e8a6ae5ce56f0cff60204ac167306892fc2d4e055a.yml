text: No, they should not be merged. While they are both types of milk, they have
  distinct properties and nutritional differences due to the absence or presence of
  lactose. Lactose-free milk is suitable for individuals with lactose intolerance,
  while whole milk is higher in fat and calories. Merging them would not accurately
  reflect these differences.
