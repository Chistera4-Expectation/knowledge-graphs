text: No, they should not be merged. While both Carrot juice and Vegetable Juice are
  juices, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Carrot juice is a specific
  type of vegetable juice, but not all vegetable juices are carrot juice. Vegetable
  juice can be made from a variety of vegetables, such as beets, celery, and spinach,
  in addition to carrots. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances
  in the Juice class.
