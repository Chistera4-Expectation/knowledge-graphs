  While horseradish dressing and sesame ginger dressing may share some common properties
  as food dressings, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they
  have distinct ingredients (horseradish vs sesame and ginger) that give them unique
  flavors and characteristics. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep these two instances
  separate.'
