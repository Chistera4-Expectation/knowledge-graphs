text: No, the instances 'Artisanal Water' and 'Distilled Water' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are types of drinking
  water, they have distinct properties and production methods. Artisanal water is
  typically sourced from natural springs and is marketed for its unique taste and
  mineral content, while distilled water is purified through a distillation process
  that removes impurities and minerals.
