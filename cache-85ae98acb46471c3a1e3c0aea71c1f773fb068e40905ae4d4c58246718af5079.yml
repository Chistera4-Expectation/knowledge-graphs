text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although both "Chicken Wings" and "Guinea Fowl Wings" are poultry-derived foods,
  they are different species of birds, and thus have different nutritional profiles
  and culinary properties. Therefore, they should be treated as distinct instances
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.
