text: No, Cultured Butter and European-style Butter should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They have different properties, with Cultured
  Butter being fermented and having a tangy flavor, while European-style Butter has
  a higher fat content and is typically churned longer for a creamier texture.
