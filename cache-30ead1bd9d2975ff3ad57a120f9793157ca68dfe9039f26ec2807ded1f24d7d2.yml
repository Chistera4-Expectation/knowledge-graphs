text: No, Coconut water and Electrolyte water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both types of water contain electrolytes, they
  are distinct fluids with different nutritional profiles and origins. Coconut water
  is a natural liquid found in young, green coconuts, while electrolyte water is a
  man-made product that typically includes added electrolytes like sodium, potassium,
  and magnesium.
