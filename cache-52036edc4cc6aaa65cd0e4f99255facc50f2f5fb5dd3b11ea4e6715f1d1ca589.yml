text: No, Pheasant Gravy and Pheasant Stock should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they share a common ingredient (pheasant),
  they serve different purposes in cooking and have distinct nutritional profiles.
  Gravy is typically a thickened sauce used to add flavor to a dish, while stock is
  a liquid used as a base for soups, stews, and sauces. They are not the same food
  item and serve different functions in the culinary world.
