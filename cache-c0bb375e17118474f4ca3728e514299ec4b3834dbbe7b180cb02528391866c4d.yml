text: 'No, they should not be merged together as they are derived from different types
  of poultry: ''Chicken Patties'' are made from chicken, while ''Pheasant Patties''
  are made from pheasant. Although they share similarities, they are distinct types
  of poultry-derived food and should be classified separately.'
