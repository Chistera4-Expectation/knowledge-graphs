text: No, Cornbread and Flaxseed Bread should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of bread, they have distinct ingredients
  and nutritional profiles. Merging them would obscure these differences and make
  it difficult to provide accurate nutritional advice for each type of bread.
