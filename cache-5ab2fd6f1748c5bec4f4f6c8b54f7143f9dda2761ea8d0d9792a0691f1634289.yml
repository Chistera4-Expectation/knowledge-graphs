text: ' No. Flaxseeds and watermelon seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of edible seeds. They have different nutritional profiles
  and characteristics, making them distinct from one another. Therefore, they should
  remain separate instances within the context of an "Edible Seeds" class.'
