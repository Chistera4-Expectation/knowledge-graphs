text: No, Mango juice and Strawberry juice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both types of juice, they are distinct flavors and contain
  different ingredients, nutritional profiles, and properties. Therefore, they should
  remain as separate instances within the Juice class.
