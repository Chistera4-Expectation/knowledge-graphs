text: 'As a dietician, my role is not to determine the classification or ontological
  aspects of food products. However, I can provide information about the nutritional
  differences between A2 Butter and Grass-fed Butter.


  A2 Butter is a type of butter made from milk produced by cows that have a specific
  genetic trait, allowing them to produce A2 beta-casein protein. This protein is
  considered easier to digest than the A1 beta-casein protein found in most cow''s
  milk. A2 Butter might be beneficial for people who have trouble digesting regular
  milk due to lactose intolerance or other reasons.


  Grass-fed Butter is made from the milk of cows that have been raised on a grass-based
  diet, rather than a grain-based diet. This results in butter with a higher concentration
  of nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin K2, and conjugated linoleic acid
  (CLA). Grass-fed Butter is generally considered a healthier option due to its higher
  nutrient content.


  While A2 Butter and Grass-fed Butter share some similarities, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates, as they are derived from different types of milk and
  have distinct nutritional profiles. However, it is possible for a butter to be both
  A2 and grass-fed, depending on the cows'' genetics and diet.'
