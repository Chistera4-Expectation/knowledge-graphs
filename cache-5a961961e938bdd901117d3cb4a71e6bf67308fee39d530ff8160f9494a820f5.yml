text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different food items derived
  from ostrich. Ostrich Gizzards refer to the gizzard part of the ostrich, which is
  a muscular organ used for grinding food, while Ostrich Soup refers to a soup made
  from ostrich meat or other parts of the ostrich. They are distinct items within
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
