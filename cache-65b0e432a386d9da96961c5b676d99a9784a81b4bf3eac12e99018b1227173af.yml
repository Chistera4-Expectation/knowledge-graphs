text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of yogurt, they
  have distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. Plain yogurt typically refers
  to a traditional yogurt made from milk and fermented with specific bacterial cultures,
  while Skyr yogurt is a type of Icelandic yogurt that is strained to create a thicker,
  creamier consistency with higher protein content. Merging them together would not
  accurately represent their unique properties.
