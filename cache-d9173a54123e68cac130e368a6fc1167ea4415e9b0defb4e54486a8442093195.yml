text: No, Canola Oil and Pistachio Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different properties,
  nutritional values, and uses in cooking. Canola Oil is a widely used oil with a
  neutral flavor, high smoke point, and a balanced fatty acid profile. Pistachio Oil,
  on the other hand, has a distinct nutty flavor and is typically used for finishing
  dishes, dressings, or as a dip.
