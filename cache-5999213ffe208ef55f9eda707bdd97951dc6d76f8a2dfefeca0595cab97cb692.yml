text: No, Tartar sauce and sour sauce should not be merged as they have distinct ingredients
  and flavor profiles. Tartar sauce typically contains mayonnaise, capers, and pickles,
  while sour sauce is made from vinegar, sugar, and spices. Although both sauces are
  used for flavor enhancement, they are different enough to warrant separate instances.
