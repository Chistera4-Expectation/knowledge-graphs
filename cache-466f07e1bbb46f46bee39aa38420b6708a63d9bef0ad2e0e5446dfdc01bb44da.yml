text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are sauces, they have distinct
  ingredients, flavors, and uses. Pesto sauce typically contains basil, olive oil,
  pine nuts, and Parmesan cheese, while soy sauce is made from fermented soybeans
  and wheat. Merging them together would not accurately represent the differences
  between the two sauces.
