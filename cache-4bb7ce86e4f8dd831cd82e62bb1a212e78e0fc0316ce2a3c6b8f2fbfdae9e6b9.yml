text: No, Castor Oil and Cooking Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both are oils derived from plants, they serve different
  purposes and have distinct properties. Castor Oil is primarily used in industrial
  applications and as a laxative, whereas Cooking Oil is used for culinary purposes
  and is safe for human consumption.
