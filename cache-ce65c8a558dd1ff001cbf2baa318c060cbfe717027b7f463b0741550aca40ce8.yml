  While duck broth and duck stock are both derived from duck, they have different
  definitions and preparation methods. Duck broth is typically made by simmering duck
  meat and bones with vegetables and aromatics, while duck stock is made by simmering
  duck bones with mirepoix (a combination of onions, carrots, and celery) and aromatics,
  without the addition of meat. These differences in preparation and ingredients make
  them distinct entities in the Poultry-derived Food class.
