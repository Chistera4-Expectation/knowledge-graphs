text: No, 'Vegetable oil' and 'Vegetables' should not be merged as they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. While both are related to plant-based foods, 'Vegetable
  oil' refers to the fat extracted from various fruits and seeds, whereas 'Vegetables'
  are edible parts of plants, such as leaves, stems, and roots, which are consumed
  for their nutritional value. They serve different purposes and have distinct nutritional
  properties.
