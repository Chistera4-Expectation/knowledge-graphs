text: ' No. While green onions (also known as scallions) and regular onions are both
  types of vegetables in the Allium family, they have distinct differences in taste,
  appearance, and culinary uses. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as
  semantic and ontological duplicates in the context of a vegetable classification
  system.'
