  Although cantaloupe seeds and pomegranate seeds are both types of edible seeds,
  they have different nutritional profiles, textures, uses, and cultural significance.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Instead, each type of seed should be treated as distinct, with its own unique properties
  and characteristics.'
