text: No, the instances 'Red chili peppers' and 'Scotch Bonnet Pepper' should not
  be merged as they are not semantic and ontological duplicates. Red chili peppers
  refer to a broader category of peppers that includes Scotch Bonnet peppers, but
  Scotch Bonnet peppers are a specific variety within that category. They have distinct
  characteristics, such as flavor, heat level, and appearance, which differentiate
  them from other types of red chili peppers.
