text: ' No, Hot Sauce and Oyster Sauce should not be merged together as they are distinctly
  different types of sauces with unique ingredients, flavors, and uses. Hot Sauce
  is typically made from chili peppers and vinegar, while Oyster Sauce is made from
  oysters, sugar, and salt. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic or ontological
  duplicates.'
