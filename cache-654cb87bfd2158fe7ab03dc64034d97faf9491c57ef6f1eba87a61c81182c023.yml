  While Heather honey and Linden honey are both types of honey, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their taste, color, aroma, and plant sources (heather vs
  linden). Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates since they refer to different specific varieties of honey with unique
  characteristics.'
