text: No, Flavored Water and Water should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of drinking water, they have different
  characteristics and uses. Flavored Water contains added flavors, while Water is
  plain. Merging them would not accurately represent the distinct differences between
  the two types of drinking water.
