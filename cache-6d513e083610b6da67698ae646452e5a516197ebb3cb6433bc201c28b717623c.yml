text: No, Almond Oil and Corn Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates because they are distinct types of edible vegetable oils with different
  botanical origins, compositions, and uses. Almond Oil is derived from almonds (Prunus
  dulcis), while Corn Oil is extracted from corn (Zea mays). These differences lead
  to variations in their nutritional profiles, culinary applications, and health benefits.
