  Although both Blueberry Honey and Buckwheat Honey fall under the category of honey,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different properties,
  such as taste, color, and nutritional content, which result from the nectar of different
  flower sources (blueberries for Blueberry Honey and buckwheat flowers for Buckwheat
  Honey). Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate entities with distinct
  characteristics.'
