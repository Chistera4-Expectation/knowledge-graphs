text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Turkey Drumsticks" and "Turkey"
  are poultry-derived foods, they refer to different parts of the turkey. "Turkey"
  can refer to the whole bird or ground turkey, while "Turkey Drumsticks" specifically
  refer to the lower part of the leg. Although they share some similarities, they
  have distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses.
