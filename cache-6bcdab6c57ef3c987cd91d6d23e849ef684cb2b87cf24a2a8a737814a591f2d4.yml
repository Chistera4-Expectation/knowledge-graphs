text: 'No, "Duck Soup" and "Duck Wings" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from ducks, they are different
  types of food: "Duck Soup" is a liquid dish, whereas "Duck Wings" are a specific
  part of the duck prepared as a solid dish. They have distinct characteristics and
  purposes in a dietician''s classification system.'
