text: ' No. While both smoked turkey and turkey are types of poultry, they are not
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Turkeys are a type of bird that can be prepared
  and consumed in various ways, one of which is smoking. Smoked turkey specifically
  refers to turkey meat that has been cured and slow-cooked with smoke, often at low
  temperatures for an extended period of time. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances as they represent distinct food items with unique preparation
  methods.'
