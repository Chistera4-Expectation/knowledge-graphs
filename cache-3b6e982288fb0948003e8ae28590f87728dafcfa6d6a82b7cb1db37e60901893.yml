text: ' No. Rice vermicelli noodles and tortellini are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged together. They belong to different types of
  pasta - rice noodles and stuffed pasta respectively, with distinct ingredients,
  shapes, preparation methods, and culinary uses. Merging them would result in loss
  of important distinctions and confuse users about their unique characteristics.'
