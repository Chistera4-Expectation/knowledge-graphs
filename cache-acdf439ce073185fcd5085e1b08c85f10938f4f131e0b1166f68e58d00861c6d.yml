text: No, Flavored Water and Spring-fed Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of drinking water with different
  characteristics and properties. Flavored Water is typically water that has been
  infused with natural or artificial flavors, while Spring-fed Water is water that
  comes from an underground aquifer and is naturally filtered through layers of rock.
  Although both are types of drinking water, they serve different purposes and cater
  to different preferences.
