text: No, they should not be merged together. Chicken broth and chicken feet are two
  different types of poultry-derived food with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses. Chicken broth is a liquid made by simmering chicken bones, meat, and/or vegetables
  in water, while chicken feet are a part of the chicken that can be cooked and consumed.
  They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
