  While blue cheese dressing and tahini dressing may both fall under the category
  of "food dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have
  distinct ingredients (blue cheese vs. tahini), flavors, textures, and uses, making
  them unique entities within their broader category. Merging these two concepts would
  result in loss of important distinctions between them.'
