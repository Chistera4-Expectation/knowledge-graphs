text: No, the instances 'Duck Stock' and 'Duck Tenders' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from ducks, they
  are distinct food items with different properties and uses. Duck stock is a liquid
  made by simmering duck bones, meat, and vegetables, while duck tenders are pieces
  of duck meat meant for consumption. They serve different purposes in cooking and
  should be considered separate entities in a Poultry-derived Food class.
