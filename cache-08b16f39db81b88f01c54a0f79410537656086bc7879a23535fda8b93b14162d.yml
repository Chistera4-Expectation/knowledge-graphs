text: ' No. Although French dressing and Russian dressing may have similar names and
  some overlapping ingredients (such as oil and vinegar), they are distinct types
  of salad dressings with unique recipes and characteristics. Therefore, it is not
  appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
