  While both grass-fed beef and lean beef can be sources of protein and other nutrients,
  they refer to different aspects of beef production and composition. Grass-fed beef
  refers to cattle that have been raised primarily on grass and forage, rather than
  being finished on grain in a feedlot. Lean beef, on the other hand, refers to cuts
  of beef that are lower in fat content compared to other cuts. Therefore, these two
  terms cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
