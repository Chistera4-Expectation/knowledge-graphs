text: No, while both Non-Dairy Yogurt and Vegan Yogurt might have overlapping characteristics,
  they are not necessarily semantic or ontologic duplicates. Non-Dairy Yogurt can
  include plant-based alternatives like soy, almond, or coconut yogurts, while Vegan
  Yogurt specifically refers to yogurts made without any animal products, including
  dairy. Some vegan yogurts may be made from non-dairy sources, but not all non-dairy
  yogurts are necessarily vegan (e.g., yogurts made from animal-derived gelatin).
  Thus, they are not exact duplicates and should be kept separate in a Yogurt classification.
