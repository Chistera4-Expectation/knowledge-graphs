text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Ostrich Drumsticks' and
  'Ostrich' are derived from the same animal, they represent different parts of the
  ostrich and therefore serve different nutritional purposes. 'Ostrich Drumsticks'
  specifically refers to the leg meat, while 'Ostrich' refers to the animal as a whole.
  This distinction is important in understanding the nutritional content and serving
  sizes of each food item.
