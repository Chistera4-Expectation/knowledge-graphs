  The two instances, "Zucchini, sliced" and "bacon bits, diced vegetables," are not
  identical in their composition or nutritional content, even though they may share
  some similarities in terms of being vegetables. Zucchini is a type of summer squash
  that is typically low in calories and rich in water content, while bacon bits are
  small pieces of cooked bacon that are high in fat and sodium. Therefore, it is not
  appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
