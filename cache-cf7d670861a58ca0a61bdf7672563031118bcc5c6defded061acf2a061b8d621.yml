text: No, the instances 'Electrolyte Water' and 'Soft Water' should not be merged
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are different types of water with distinct
  properties and purposes. Electrolyte water contains minerals and electrolytes to
  aid in hydration and sports performance, while soft water typically refers to water
  that has had its mineral content reduced, making it more suitable for household
  use and preventing scale buildup in appliances.
