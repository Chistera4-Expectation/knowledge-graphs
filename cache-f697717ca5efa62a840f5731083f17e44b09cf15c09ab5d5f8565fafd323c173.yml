text: ' The most adequate class for "Corn tortillas" would be "Edible Vegetable."
  While it may seem unusual to categorize corn tortillas as a vegetable, in the context
  of food classification, grains such as corn are often grouped with vegetables due
  to their similar nutritional profiles. Corn is considered a whole grain and provides
  fiber and other essential nutrients found in vegetables. Therefore, within this
  given list, the best fit category for corn tortillas would be "Edible Vegetable."'
