text: No, Grapeseed Oil and Soybean Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of edible vegetable
  oils, they have distinct nutritional profiles, uses, and origins. Grapeseed Oil
  is derived from the seeds of grapes, while Soybean Oil comes from soybeans. They
  have different fatty acid compositions, flavors, and smoke points, which make them
  suitable for different culinary applications. Therefore, they should be kept as
  separate instances in a classification system.
