text: As a dietician, I would not consider "Lassi Yogurt" and "Plain Yogurt" as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates, as they differ in their ingredients and preparation methods.
  Lassi Yogurt is a traditional Indian drink made by blending yogurt with water, spices,
  and sometimes fruit, while Plain Yogurt is a dairy product made by fermenting milk
  with specific bacterial cultures. Therefore, my answer is no.
