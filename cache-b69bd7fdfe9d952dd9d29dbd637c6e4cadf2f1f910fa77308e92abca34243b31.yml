text: ' No. Sashimi-grade fish and dry fish are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They refer to different types of fish products
  with distinct characteristics and uses. Sashimi-grade fish refers to high-quality
  fish that is safe for raw consumption, while dry fish is any type of fish that has
  been preserved through drying.'
