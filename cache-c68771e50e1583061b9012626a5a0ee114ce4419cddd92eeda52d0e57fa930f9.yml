text: No, they should not be merged. While both Ceylon Tea and Lemon Tea are types
  of tea, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Ceylon Tea is a specific
  type of black tea grown in Sri Lanka, while Lemon Tea is a type of tea flavored
  with lemon. They have different characteristics, origins, and ingredients, making
  them distinct types of tea.
