  While crab meat is a general term for the edible flesh from any species of crab,
  stone crab refers specifically to the meat from a stone crab, which is a particular
  species of crab. Although they are both edible crustaceans, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates because they represent different specific types of crabs.
