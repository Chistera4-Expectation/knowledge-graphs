text: 'No, Chicken Broth and Chicken Stock are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While they share similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of preparation
  and culinary usage.


  Chicken Broth is typically made by simmering chicken meat, bones, and vegetables
  in water. It is usually lighter and clearer in appearance. Chicken Broth is often
  used as a base for soups, stews, and sauces, and is also suitable for drinking on
  its own.


  On the other hand, Chicken Stock is made by simmering chicken bones, trimmings,
  and aromatic vegetables in water for a longer period of time. This results in a
  richer, more flavorful, and opaque liquid. Chicken Stock is commonly used as a base
  for sauces, gravies, and risottos, and is less suitable for drinking on its own.


  Although both Chicken Broth and Chicken Stock are derived from chicken, their preparation
  methods and culinary uses are distinct, warranting separate classifications.'
