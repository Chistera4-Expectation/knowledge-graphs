text: No, Earl Grey Tea and Herbal Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates, as they are different types of tea with distinct properties and flavors.
  Earl Grey Tea is a black tea flavored with bergamot oil, while Herbal Tea refers
  to a variety of teas made from herbs, fruits, or other plants, and does not contain
  any actual tea leaves.
