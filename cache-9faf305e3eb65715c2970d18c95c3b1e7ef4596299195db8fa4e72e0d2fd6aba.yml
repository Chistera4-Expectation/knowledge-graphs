  While both Chai tea and Kombucha tea are types of tea, they have distinct differences
  in terms of their ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. Chai
  tea is a spiced tea that typically includes black tea, milk, sugar, and spices such
  as cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger, while Kombucha tea is a fermented tea drink made
  from sweetened black tea and a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY).
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
