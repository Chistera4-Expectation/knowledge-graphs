text: ' No. Honey mustard dressing and horseradish dressing are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they may both fall under the category of "food dressings," they
  have distinct ingredients and flavors that make them unique from one another. Merging
  these two instances would result in loss of important distinctions between the two
  types of dressings.'
