text: No, the instances 'Fried Taro Dumplings' and 'Taro Cake' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both contain taro,
  they are prepared differently and have distinct textures and flavors. Fried Taro
  Dumplings are typically deep-fried and have a crispy outer layer, while Taro Cake
  is often steamed or pan-fried and has a softer, denser texture.
