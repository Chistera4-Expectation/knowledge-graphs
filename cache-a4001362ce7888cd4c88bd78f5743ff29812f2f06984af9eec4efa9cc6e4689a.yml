text: ' No. While Scotch bonnet peppers and habanero peppers are similar in terms
  of heat level (both are very spicy) and appearance, they are not the same thing.
  They are different varieties of chili pepper that originate from slightly different
  regions and can have subtle differences in flavor. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
