text: No, Chili Powder and Five-spice powder should not be merged together as they
  have distinct flavors and compositions. Chili Powder primarily consists of chili
  peppers, while Five-spice powder is a blend of five spices, typically including
  star anise, cloves, Chinese cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds. Although
  they are both used as seasonings, they serve different purposes and cater to different
  culinary preferences.
