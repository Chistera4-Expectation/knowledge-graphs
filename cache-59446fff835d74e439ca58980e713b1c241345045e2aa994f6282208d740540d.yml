text: ' No. Game meats and mechanically separated meat are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged together. They refer to distinct types of poultry-derived
  food products with different nutritional profiles and production methods.


  Game meats typically refer to the meat of wild animals that are hunted for food,
  such as venison (deer), bison, rabbit, and quail. These meats tend to have lower
  fat content compared to domesticated farmed poultry like chicken and turkey, and
  can vary in taste, texture, and nutrient composition depending on the specific animal
  and its habitat.


  On the other hand, mechanically separated meat (MSM) is a highly processed form
  of poultry meat produced by forcing bones and remaining flesh through a sieve under
  high pressure. This results in a paste-like substance that is then mixed with binders
  and flavorings before being formed into various poultry products, including hot
  dogs, nuggets, and sausages. MSM has higher fat content than many game meats due
  to its manufacturing process and often contains added salt, sugar, and artificial
  flavors. As such, it''s essential to maintain these categories separate when discussing
  poultry-derived foods from a dietary standpoint.'
