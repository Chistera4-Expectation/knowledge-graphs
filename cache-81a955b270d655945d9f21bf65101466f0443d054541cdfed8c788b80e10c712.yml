  Although both Acacia honey and Raw Wildflower honey are types of honey, they have
  distinct characteristics that make them different from each other. Acacia honey
  is known for its mild flavor, light color, low sucrose content, and high fructose
  content, while raw wildflower honey has a more robust flavor profile, varies in
  color depending on the flowers visited by the bees, contains small amounts of pollen
  and propolis, and may have higher antioxidant properties due to its floral sources.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two classes as semantic and
  ontological duplicates since they refer to separate and unique kinds of honey with
  specific attributes and uses.'
