text: ' No. While both "The base ingredient of the sauce" and "Dark soy sauce" are
  related to sauces and may even refer to the same thing in some contexts, they do
  not represent semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different meanings and
  can be used in distinct ways depending on the specific situation. Merging them would
  result in loss of meaning and precision.'
