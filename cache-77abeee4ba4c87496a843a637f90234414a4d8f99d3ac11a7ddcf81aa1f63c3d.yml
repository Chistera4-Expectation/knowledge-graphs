text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  Chili Powder and Red Chili Peppers contain chili, they are different in terms of
  their form, processing, and usage in cooking. Chili Powder is a ground spice mixture
  made from dried chili peppers and other spices, while Red Chili Peppers are whole
  or chopped dried peppers. Their nutritional values and intensity of heat may vary
  as well.
