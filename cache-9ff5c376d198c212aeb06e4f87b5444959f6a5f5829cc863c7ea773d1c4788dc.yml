text: No, Lettuce and Romaine lettuce should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of lettuce, they have distinct
  characteristics and properties that differentiate them from each other. Romaine
  lettuce, for example, has a more elongated shape and is generally more robust than
  regular lettuce. These differences justify their separate representation in a dietician's
  Edible Vegetable class.
