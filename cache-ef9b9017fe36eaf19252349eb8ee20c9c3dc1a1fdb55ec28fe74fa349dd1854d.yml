  The two instances, "Boneless, skinless chicken breasts" and "Chicken soup," are
  not identical in terms of their composition, preparation method, and nutritional
  content. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are a whole food item that contains
  lean protein, while chicken soup is a dish made from chicken broth, vegetables,
  and sometimes noodles or rice, which provides a mix of protein, carbohydrates, and
  fats. Although both may contain chicken, they have different textures, tastes, and
  purposes when consumed. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate rather
  than merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
