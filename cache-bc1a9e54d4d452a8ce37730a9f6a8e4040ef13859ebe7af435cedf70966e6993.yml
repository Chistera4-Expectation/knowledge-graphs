text: No, Assam Tea and English Breakfast Tea should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they both belong to the category of black tea, they
  have distinct characteristics, origins, and flavor profiles. Assam Tea comes from
  the Assam region in India and is known for its strong, malty flavor, while English
  Breakfast Tea is a blend of different black teas, often including Assam tea, and
  is known for its full-bodied, robust flavor. They may have similarities, but they
  are distinct varieties of tea with unique properties.
