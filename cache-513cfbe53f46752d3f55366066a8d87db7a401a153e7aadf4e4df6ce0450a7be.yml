text: No, Castor Oil and Chili Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties,
  uses, and origins. Castor oil is derived from the castor bean, while chili oil is
  made from chili peppers. They are not interchangeable in terms of their culinary
  applications or nutritional profiles.
