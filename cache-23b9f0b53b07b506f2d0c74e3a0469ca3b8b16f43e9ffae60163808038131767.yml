  While horseradish dressing and poppy seed dressing may belong to the same category
  of food (i.e., salad dressings), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they have different ingredients, flavors, textures, and uses. Horseradish
  dressing is typically made with grated horseradish root, vinegar, cream or mayo,
  and seasonings, while poppy seed dressing usually consists of vegetable oil, red
  wine vinegar or lemon juice, sugar or honey, mustard, onion, salt, poppy seeds,
  and sometimes other herbs and spices. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge them as duplicates.'
