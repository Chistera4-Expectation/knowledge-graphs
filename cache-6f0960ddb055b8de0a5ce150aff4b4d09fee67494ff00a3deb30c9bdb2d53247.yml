text: No, they should not be merged together. 'Creamy Yogurt' and 'Savory Yogurt'
  are two distinct types of yogurt based on their taste and texture. Although they
  may share some common characteristics, they represent different subcategories within
  the broader category of yogurt. Merging them would not accurately reflect the variety
  of yogurt options available.
