text: No, Canola Oil and Flaxseed Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have different
  properties, nutritional profiles, and uses. Canola oil is derived from the seeds
  of the canola plant (a variety of rapeseed) and is high in monounsaturated fat and
  low in saturated fat. Flaxseed oil, on the other hand, is derived from the seeds
  of the flax plant and is high in polyunsaturated fat, particularly omega-3 fatty
  acids. These differences make them distinct oils with unique benefits and applications
  in cooking and nutrition.
