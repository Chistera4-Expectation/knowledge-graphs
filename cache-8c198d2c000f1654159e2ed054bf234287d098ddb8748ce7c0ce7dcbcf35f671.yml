text: ' No. French dressing and yogurt dressing are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  While they can both be used as dressings for salads or other dishes, they have distinct
  ingredients and characteristics. French dressing is typically made with oil, vinegar,
  sugar, and various spices, while yogurt dressing usually contains yogurt, oil, vinegar
  or lemon juice, herbs, and seasonings. Therefore, they belong to different categories
  of dressings.'
