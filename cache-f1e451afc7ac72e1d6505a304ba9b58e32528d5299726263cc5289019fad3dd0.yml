text: No, Goat's Milk and Hemp Milk should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are different types of milk with distinct nutritional profiles
  and properties. Goat's Milk is an animal milk, while Hemp Milk is a plant-based
  milk alternative. Merging them would be incorrect in terms of categorization and
  could lead to confusion.
