text: No, 'Guinea Fowl Stock' and 'Pheasant Stock' should not be merged together as
  they are two distinct types of poultry-derived stocks, each with unique nutritional
  and flavor profiles. Although they both fall under the Poultry-derived Food class,
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
