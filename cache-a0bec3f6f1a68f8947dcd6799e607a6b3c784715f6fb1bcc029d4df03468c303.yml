text: No, they should not be merged together. While they are both types of edible
  vegetable oils, sunflower oil and walnut oil have distinct properties, nutritional
  profiles, and uses. Sunflower oil is derived from sunflower seeds and is typically
  high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, while walnut oil is derived from
  walnuts and has a higher content of omega-3 fatty acids. These differences make
  them unique and valuable as separate entities in the edible vegetable oil class.
