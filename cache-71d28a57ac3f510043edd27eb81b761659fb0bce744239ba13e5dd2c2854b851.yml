text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of tea with unique
  flavors, origins, and processing methods. Ceylon Tea is a black tea from Sri Lanka,
  while Jasmine Tea is a green tea scented with jasmine flowers. Although they are
  both types of tea, they have distinct characteristics and should be treated as separate
  entities in a classification system.
