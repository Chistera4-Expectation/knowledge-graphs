  Although brown rice and jasmine rice are both types of rice, they have different
  nutritional profiles and characteristics that make them distinct from one another.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.


  Brown rice is a whole grain rice that has been minimally processed, retaining its
  bran layer and germ. It contains more fiber, protein, and essential minerals than
  white rice varieties, making it a healthier option for many individuals. Brown rice
  also has a nuttier flavor and chewier texture compared to other types of rice.


  On the other hand, Jasmine rice is a type of long-grain white rice that originated
  in Thailand. It has a distinctive aroma and soft, sticky texture when cooked, which
  makes it popular in Southeast Asian cuisine. While Jasmine rice may contain some
  vitamins and minerals, it generally has fewer nutrients than brown rice due to the
  milling process that removes the bran layer and germ.


  Therefore, while both brown rice and jasmine rice belong to the same general category
  (rice), they cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates because they
  differ in terms of their nutritional content, taste, texture, and cultural significance.'
