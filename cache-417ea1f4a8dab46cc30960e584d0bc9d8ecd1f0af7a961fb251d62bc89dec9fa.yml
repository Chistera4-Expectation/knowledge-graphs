text: No, Cashew Milk and Milk should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While Cashew Milk is a type of plant-based milk, it is not a duplicate of traditional
  Milk (dairy milk) as they have different nutritional profiles, production methods,
  and sources. They should be treated as distinct entities within the same class.
