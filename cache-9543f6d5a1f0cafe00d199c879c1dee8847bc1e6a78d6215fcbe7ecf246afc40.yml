text: 'No, they should not be merged together. Electrolyte Water and Infused Water
  are distinct types of drinking water, each with different properties and purposes.


  Electrolyte Water contains electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium, which
  help maintain fluid balance and support muscle and nerve function. It is typically
  marketed as a sports drink or recovery beverage to replenish lost electrolytes during
  exercise or physical activity.


  Infused Water, on the other hand, is plain water that has been flavored with fruits,
  vegetables, or herbs. It is typically used for adding flavor and variety to plain
  water, without adding significant calories or sugar.


  While both types of water can be consumed for hydration purposes, they serve different
  needs and have unique characteristics. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
