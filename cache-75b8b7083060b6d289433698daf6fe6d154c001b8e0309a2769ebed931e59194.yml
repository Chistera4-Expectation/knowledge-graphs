text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Amaranth Seeds" and "Seeds"
  are related, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. "Amaranth Seeds" is
  a specific type of seed, while "Seeds" is a broader category that includes many
  different types of seeds. Merging them would lose the specificity of "Amaranth Seeds."
