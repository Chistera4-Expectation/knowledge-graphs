text: No, Basmati Rice and Glutinous Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics, uses,
  and nutritional profiles. Basmati Rice is a long-grain aromatic rice commonly used
  in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine, while Glutinous Rice is a short-grain, sticky
  rice used in Asian dishes, such as sushi and rice pudding.
