text: As a dietician, my answer is no. While bouillon cubes and bouillon powders are
  similar in that they are both concentrated forms of stock used for flavoring, they
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. They have distinct differences in form,
  usage, and preparation, which makes them unique instances in the Food Seasoning
  class.
