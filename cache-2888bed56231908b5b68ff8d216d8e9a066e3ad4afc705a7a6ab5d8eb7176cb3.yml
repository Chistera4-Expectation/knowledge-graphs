text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Pork Sausage' and 'Salt Pork' are derived from pork, they are different types of
  pork-based food products. 'Pork Sausage' typically refers to ground pork mixed with
  seasonings and stuffed into a casing, while 'Salt Pork' refers to pork belly that
  has been cured in salt, usually used as a flavoring or cooking ingredient. They
  have distinct culinary uses and preparation methods, so they should remain separate
  instances in a food classification system.
