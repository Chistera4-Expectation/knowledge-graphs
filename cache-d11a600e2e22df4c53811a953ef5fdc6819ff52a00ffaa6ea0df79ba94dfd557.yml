text: No, Glutinous Rice and Parboiled Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have different properties
  and uses. Glutinous Rice is characterized by its sticky texture and is often used
  in desserts and sweet dishes, while Parboiled Rice is partially boiled in the husk,
  which results in a more nutritious and firmer grain that retains its shape during
  cooking.
