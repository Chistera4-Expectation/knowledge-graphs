text: ' No. Cottonseed oil and soybean oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they are both types of edible vegetable oils. They come from different
  plant sources (cottonseeds vs. soybeans) and have distinct nutritional profiles,
  production processes, and uses in cooking and food manufacturing. Therefore, it
  is important to maintain them as separate instances within the Edible Vegetal Oil
  class.'
