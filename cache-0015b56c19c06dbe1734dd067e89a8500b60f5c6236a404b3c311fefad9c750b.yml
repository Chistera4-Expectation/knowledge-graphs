text: ' No, they are not semantic and ontological duplicates. Green onions (also known
  as scallions) and optional ingredients such as fried onions, boiled eggs, and nuts
  have different meanings and uses in recipes. While green onions are a type of vegetable
  that can be used as an ingredient, fried onions, boiled eggs, and nuts are examples
  of ways to prepare or enhance other dishes. Therefore, they do not represent duplicate
  concepts in this context.'
