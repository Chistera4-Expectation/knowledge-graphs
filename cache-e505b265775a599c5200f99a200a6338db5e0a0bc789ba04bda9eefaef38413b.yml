text: No, the instances "Chicken Soup" and "chicken/vegetable stock" should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived
  from poultry (chicken) and contain a similar base ingredient, they are different
  types of food with distinct characteristics and uses. Chicken soup typically includes
  additional ingredients, such as vegetables and noodles, and is served as a complete
  dish. On the other hand, chicken/vegetable stock is a liquid base for various recipes
  and is not consumed on its own. Therefore, they are not duplicates in terms of their
  semantics and ontology.
