text: No, the instances 'Cooking thermometer' and 'Seasoning cubes' should not be
  merged together as they serve different purposes. A cooking thermometer is a tool
  used to measure temperature, while seasoning cubes are a type of seasoning used
  to enhance flavor in dishes. They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
