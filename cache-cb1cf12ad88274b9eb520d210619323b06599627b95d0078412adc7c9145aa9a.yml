text: No, Beet juice and Blueberry juice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of juice, they are derived
  from different fruits and have distinct nutritional profiles. Merging them would
  lead to a loss of specific information and potentially misleading nutritional advice.
