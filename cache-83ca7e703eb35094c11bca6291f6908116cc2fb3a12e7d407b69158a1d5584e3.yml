  While chili oil and olive oil are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their ingredients, flavors, uses, and nutritional profiles.
  Chili oil is made by infusing oil (usually sesame or peanut) with dried chili flakes
  or powder, resulting in a spicy and flavorful condiment used primarily for seasoning
  dishes. Olive oil, on the other hand, is obtained from pressing whole olives without
  heat or chemicals, producing an unrefined oil that retains its natural antioxidants
  and anti-inflammatory properties; it is widely used in cooking and salad dressings
  due to its mild yet fruity taste and high smoke point. Therefore, these two types
  of oils should not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
