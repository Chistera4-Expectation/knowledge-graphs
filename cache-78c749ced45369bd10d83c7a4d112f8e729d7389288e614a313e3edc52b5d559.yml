text: No, 'Chicken Feet' and 'Chicken Wings' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from chickens, they differ
  in their nutritional content and culinary uses. Chicken feet are rich in collagen
  and are often used in Asian cuisine, while chicken wings are a popular food item
  and are often fried or grilled.
