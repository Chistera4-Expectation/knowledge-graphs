text: No, Sesame Oil and Soybean Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct chemical compositions, flavors, and uses in cooking and food preparation.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent the differences between these
  oils.
