  Fish and Swordfish are two different species of fish, with distinct ontological
  categories and semantic properties. While they may be related taxonomically, they
  have different nutritional profiles, ecological roles, and culinary uses. Merging
  them would lose the crucial distinctions between these two species, which could
  lead to inaccuracies and misconceptions about their respective characteristics.'
