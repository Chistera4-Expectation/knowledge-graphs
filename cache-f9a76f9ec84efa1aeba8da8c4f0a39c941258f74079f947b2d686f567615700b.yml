  While both "cooked rice" and "jasmine rice" refer to types of rice, they are not
  semantic nor ontological duplicates. Cooked rice is any type of rice that has been
  prepared by boiling, steaming, or baking it until it becomes soft and edible. Jasmine
  rice, on the other hand, is a specific variety of long-grain rice that is known
  for its fragrant aroma and slightly sticky texture when cooked. Therefore, while
  jasmine rice can certainly be served as cooked rice, there are many other varieties
  of rice (such as basmati, brown, or sushi rice) that could also fit under the category
  of cooked rice.'
