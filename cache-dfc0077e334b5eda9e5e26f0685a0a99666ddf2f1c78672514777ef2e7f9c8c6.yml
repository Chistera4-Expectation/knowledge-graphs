text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both Cow's Milk and Pea Milk belong to the Milk class, they are different types
  of milk with distinct properties and nutritional profiles. Cow's Milk is an animal-based
  product, while Pea Milk is plant-based and derived from peas. They should be treated
  as separate instances within the Milk class.
