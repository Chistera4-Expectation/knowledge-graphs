text: No, Pheasant Broth and Turkey Broth should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they both fall under the Poultry-derived Food
  class, they are distinct types of broth made from different types of poultry. They
  have different nutritional profiles and flavors, making them unique entities in
  the context of food.
