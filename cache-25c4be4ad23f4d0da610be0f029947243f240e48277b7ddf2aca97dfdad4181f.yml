text: "As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on the nutritional content of these\
  \ sauces. However, in terms of semantics and ontology, I recommend consulting with\
  \ a subject matter expert in those fields.\n\nFrom a nutritional standpoint, B\xE9\
  chamel sauce and Hollandaise sauce are distinct in their ingredients and nutritional\
  \ composition. B\xE9chamel sauce is typically made with butter, flour, and milk,\
  \ while Hollandaise sauce is made with butter, egg yolks, and lemon juice. They\
  \ have different calorie, fat, and cholesterol levels, and thus should not be merged\
  \ as nutritional duplicates.\n\nIn the context of semantics and ontology, I would\
  \ suggest seeking the opinion of someone with expertise in those fields, as they\
  \ can provide a more informed answer regarding whether these sauces should be merged\
  \ as duplicates in that context."
