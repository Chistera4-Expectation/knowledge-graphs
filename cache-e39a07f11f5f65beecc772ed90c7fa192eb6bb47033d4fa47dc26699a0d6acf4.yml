text: No, Flaxseed Oil and Hemp Seed Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they share some similarities, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles, benefits, and uses. Flaxseed Oil is rich in Omega-3 fatty
  acids (alpha-linolenic acid), while Hemp Seed Oil contains more balanced Omega-3
  and Omega-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid). Additionally, they are derived from different
  plants and have different flavor profiles.
