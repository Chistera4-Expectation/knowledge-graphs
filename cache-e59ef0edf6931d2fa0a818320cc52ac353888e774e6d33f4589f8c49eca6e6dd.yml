  While chili paste and ginger paste are both food seasonings with similar properties
  (i.e., they are pastes made from ingredients used to add flavor), they serve different
  purposes in cooking due to their distinct flavors and uses. Chili paste is typically
  spicy and savory, while ginger paste adds warmth and pungency to dishes. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates
  since they have unique culinary applications.'
