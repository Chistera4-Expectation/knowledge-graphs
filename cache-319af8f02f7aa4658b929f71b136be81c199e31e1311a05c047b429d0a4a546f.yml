text: ' No. Catfish and sashimi-grade fish are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They belong to different categories of edible
  fish with distinct characteristics, uses, and preparation methods. Catfish is a
  type of freshwater or saltwater fish that has a broadhead, whisker-like barbels,
  and a slimy skin. It can be prepared in various ways such as grilling, frying, or
  stewing. On the other hand, sashimi-grade fish refers to any fish species that meets
  the high standards for sushi-grade raw consumption, meaning it is fresh, safe, and
  free from parasites. Sashimi-grade fish includes tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and others,
  which may differ from catfish in terms of taste, texture, and culinary use. Therefore,
  they are separate concepts and should not be merged.'
