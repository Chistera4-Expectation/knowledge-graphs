  Although both fresh basil leaves and fresh cilantro leaves are types of herbs and
  can be used in similar ways in cooking (such as garnishing or adding flavor to dishes),
  they have distinct tastes, appearances, textures, and nutritional profiles. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  are two separate ingredients with unique properties that contribute differently
  to various recipes.'
