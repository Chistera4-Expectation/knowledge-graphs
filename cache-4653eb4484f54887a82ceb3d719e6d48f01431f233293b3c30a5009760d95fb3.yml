text: No, "Chicken Wings" and "Turkey Wings" should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of poultry wings, they come from
  different species of birds and have different nutritional profiles. Therefore, they
  should be treated as separate entities in a dietician's classification system.
