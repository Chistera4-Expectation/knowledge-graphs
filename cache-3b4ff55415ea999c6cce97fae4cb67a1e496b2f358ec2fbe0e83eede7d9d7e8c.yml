text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. While both Hibiscus Tea and Pu-erh Tea
  are types of tea, they have distinct properties, flavors, and health benefits. Therefore,
  they should not be considered semantic or ontologic duplicates. It is essential
  to differentiate between them in a dietary context.
