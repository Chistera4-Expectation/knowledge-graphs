text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from quail,
  they have different nutritional profiles and uses. Quail Broth is a liquid food
  preparation made from simmering quail in water, whereas Quail refers to the bird
  itself, which can be consumed in various forms such as roasted, grilled, or used
  in soups and stews. Merging them together would not accurately represent their distinct
  properties and uses in the Poultry-derived Food class.
