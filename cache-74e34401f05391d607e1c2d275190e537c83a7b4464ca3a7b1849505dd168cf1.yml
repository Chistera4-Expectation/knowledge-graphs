  While both "Juice" and "Lime Juice" are related to each other (with Lime Juice being
  a type of Juice), they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates
  because they refer to different concepts with distinct properties and usage.


  In this context:


  * "Juice" is a general term for any liquid extracted from fruits or vegetables.
  It can include various flavors depending on what fruit or vegetable it was derived
  from.

  * "Lime Juice," specifically, refers to the liquid obtained by squeezing limes.
  This constitutes a more specific category within the broader domain covered by "Juice."


  Therefore, merging them would not accurately represent their real-world relationships
  and meanings.'
