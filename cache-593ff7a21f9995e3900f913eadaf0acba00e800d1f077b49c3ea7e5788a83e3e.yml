  While both chicken pot pie and chicken salad contain chicken and are therefore similar
  in some respects, they have distinct ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional
  profiles. Chicken pot pie typically includes a crust, vegetables such as peas and
  carrots, and is baked in an oven, while chicken salad usually consists of diced
  cooked chicken mixed with mayonnaise or another dressing and often includes additional
  ingredients like celery, grapes, or nuts. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
