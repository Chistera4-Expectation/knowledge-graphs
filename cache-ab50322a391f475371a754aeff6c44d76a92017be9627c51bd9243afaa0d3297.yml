text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Energy drink' and 'XS Energy'
  are related to energy drinks, they are not the same entity. 'Energy drink' is a
  general term for a beverage category, while 'XS Energy' is a specific brand within
  that category. Merging them would be a loss of information and would not accurately
  represent the relationships between the classes and instances in the ontology.
