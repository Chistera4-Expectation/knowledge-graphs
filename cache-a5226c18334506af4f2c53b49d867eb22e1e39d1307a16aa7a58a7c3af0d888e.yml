text: No, the instances 'Maitake Mushroom' and 'Oyster Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible mushrooms,
  they are different species with distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles,
  and culinary uses. Maitake mushrooms (Grifola frondosa) are also known as hen-of-the-woods,
  while oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) are known for their delicate, oyster-like
  flavor. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique features of each
  mushroom.
