text: ' The most adequate class name for "Glucose Drip: A solution containing glucose"
  would be "GlucoseInfusion". This name clearly conveys the nature of the substance
  and its purpose as an infusion or intravenous solution. Neither Coffee nor Tea fit
  this description, as they are not solutions containing glucose.'
