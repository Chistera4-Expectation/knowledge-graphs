text: No, Macadamia Nut Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  different sources (nuts and grains, respectively) and unique nutritional profiles.
  Merging them would not accurately represent their distinct characteristics and uses.
