  While both miso paste and chili bean paste can be used for seasoning food, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different ingredients,
  flavors, textures, origins, and uses in cooking. Miso paste is made from fermented
  soybeans and grains, has a rich umami flavor, and a smooth texture that varies depending
  on the type of miso. It is commonly used in Japanese cuisine to make soups, sauces,
  marinades, and dressings. Chili bean paste, also known as doubanjiang or toban djan,
  is made from fermented beans (usually broad or fava beans), spices, and chilies,
  resulting in a pungent, salty, and spicy taste with a thick consistency. It is widely
  used in Chinese and some Southeast Asian dishes like stir-fries, hot pot, braises,
  stews, and dipping sauces.'
