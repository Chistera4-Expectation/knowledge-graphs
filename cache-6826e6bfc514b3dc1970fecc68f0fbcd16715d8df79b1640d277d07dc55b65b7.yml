  Although long grain white rice and sushi rice may appear similar at first glance,
  they have distinct differences in terms of their properties and uses, which make
  them non-duplicate entities. Here are some key factors that distinguish these two
  types of rice:


  1. Texture: Long grain white rice has a firm texture when cooked due to its lower
  starch content compared to sushi rice. Sushi rice is sticky because it contains
  more amylopectin starch, allowing for easier manipulation during sushi preparation.

  2. Preparation method: Both rices require different cooking techniques to bring
  out optimal textures and flavors. For example, sushi rice typically involves washing,
  soaking, draining, and then cooking with slightly less water than directed on packaging.
  In contrast, long grain white rice usually just requires simple boiling and steaming
  without any additional steps.

  3. Taste: Due to varying cultivars and processing methods, each type of rice exhibits
  unique flavor profiles. Sushi rice tends to have a subtle sweetness from added sugar
  or vinegar mixtures used in traditional recipes, whereas long grain white rice is
  relatively plain tasting.

  4. Uses: As suggested by their names, these rices serve specific purposes in various
  dishes. While long grain white rice can be incorporated into many meals like stir-fries,
  casseroles, pilafs, or even enjoyed on its own, sushi rice is reserved primarily
  for making Japanese cuisine such as rolls, nigiri, and hand rolls.

  5. Nutritional value: Although both options provide carbohydrates, proteins, and
  small amounts of vitamins & minerals, there might still be slight variations between
  nutrient compositions depending on farming practices, milling procedures, etc. These
  discrepancies further support keeping them separate entities within the context
  of nutrition and food science.'
