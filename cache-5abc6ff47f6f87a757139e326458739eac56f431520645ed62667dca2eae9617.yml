text: ' The most adequate class for ''Enzymes'' would be ''Spice''. While enzymes
  are not spices themselves, they can sometimes be found in spices and have similar
  functions as spices in terms of enhancing the digestion and absorption of food.
  Spices such as ginger, papaya, pineapple, and mango contain enzymes that aid in
  breaking down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates during digestion. Therefore, using
  these spices as seasonings or dressings can enhance the body''s ability to absorb
  nutrients from food, making them an appropriate category for enzymes.'
