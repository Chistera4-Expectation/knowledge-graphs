text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although both are types of water, they serve different purposes and have distinct
  properties. Alkaline water has a higher pH level and is marketed for its potential
  health benefits, while water for egg wash is used in cooking to help egg-based coatings
  adhere to food items. These differences in purpose and properties make them distinct
  entities within the Drinking Water class.
