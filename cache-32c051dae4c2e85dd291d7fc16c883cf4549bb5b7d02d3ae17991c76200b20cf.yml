text: No, Grapeseed Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  different sources (grape seeds and wheat germ, respectively) and therefore have
  distinct properties, nutritional values, and uses.
