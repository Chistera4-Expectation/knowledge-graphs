  While both flaxseed oil and safflower oil are types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct nutritional profiles and uses, so they should not be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Flaxseed oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids, making it
  beneficial for heart health and inflammation reduction. Safflower oil, on the other
  hand, contains primarily unsaturated fats and has a higher smoke point than flaxseed
  oil, making it suitable for cooking at high temperatures. Therefore, these two oils
  serve different purposes and offer unique benefits to consumers.'
