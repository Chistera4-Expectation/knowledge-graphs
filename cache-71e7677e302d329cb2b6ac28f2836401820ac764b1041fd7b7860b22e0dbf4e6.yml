text: No, Agave nectar and Humectants should not be merged together as they are different
  types of sweeteners with distinct properties and uses. Agave nectar is a specific
  type of sweetener derived from the agave plant, while humectants are a class of
  ingredients that help retain moisture in food products, which may or may not be
  sweeteners. They serve different purposes and should remain as separate instances
  in the Sweetener class.
