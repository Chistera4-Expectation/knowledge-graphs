  Fish sauce and tomato sauce are not semantic or ontological duplicates, as they
  refer to two distinctly different condiments with unique ingredients and uses. Fish
  sauce is made from fermented fish or fish paste, while tomato sauce is typically
  made from cooked and pureed tomatoes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge these instances together.'
