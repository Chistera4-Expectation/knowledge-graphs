  Although both chicken and turkey are types of poultry, they have different nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses. Chicken broth is made specifically from chicken, while
  turkey can be prepared in various ways that may not resemble chicken (e.g., ground
  turkey, smoked turkey). Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two
  instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
