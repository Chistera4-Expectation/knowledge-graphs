text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both instances are derived from the same bird, they are distinct food products with
  different forms and preparations. Guinea Fowl Sausage refers to a processed and
  seasoned meat product, while Guinea Fowl Thighs refer to a specific cut of meat.
  These differences in form and preparation make them distinct instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
