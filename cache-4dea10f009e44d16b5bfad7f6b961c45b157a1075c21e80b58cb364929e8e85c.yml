text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  they both represent onions, 'Red onion' refers to a specific type of onion, while
  'Sliced onions' refers to a preparation method that can be applied to various types
  of onions, including red onions. They should be considered as separate instances
  with different properties.
