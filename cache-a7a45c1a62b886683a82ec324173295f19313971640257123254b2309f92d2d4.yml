  While garlic paste and pepper to taste may both be considered food seasonings, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct flavors, uses, and
  properties that make them unique from one another. Garlic paste is made by blending
  garlic cloves with oil or water into a smooth paste, while "pepper to taste" refers
  to adding ground black pepper according to personal preference for flavor. Therefore,
  these two instances represent different concepts within the context of a Food Seasoning
  class.'
