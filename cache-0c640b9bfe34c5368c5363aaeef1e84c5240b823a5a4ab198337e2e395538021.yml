text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of yogurt with distinct
  characteristics. Drinkable Yogurt is a liquid or semi-liquid yogurt form, while
  Icelandic Yogurt, also known as Skyr, is a thick, creamy yogurt with a high protein
  content. These differences in texture and nutritional content make them unique types
  of yogurt.
