text: No, they should not be merged. Pickled vegetables and vegetable oil are distinct
  food items with different nutritional properties and uses. Pickled vegetables are
  typically preserved vegetables, while vegetable oil is a fat extracted from plants.
  They belong to different categories within the broader 'edible vegetable' class.
