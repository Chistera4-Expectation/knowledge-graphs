text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are sauces, they have different
  ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. Chili bean sauce is typically made with
  chili peppers, fermented soybeans, and spices, while marinara sauce is made with
  tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. They are distinct sauces with different culinary applications.
