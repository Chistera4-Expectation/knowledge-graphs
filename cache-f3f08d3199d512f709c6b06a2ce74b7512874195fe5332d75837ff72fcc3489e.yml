text: No, the instances 'Chicken of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Reishi Mushroom' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible
  mushrooms, they have different characteristics, tastes, and uses. Chicken of the
  Woods is known for its meaty texture and is often used as a meat substitute, while
  Reishi is primarily used for its medicinal properties. Merging them together would
  not accurately represent their unique qualities.
