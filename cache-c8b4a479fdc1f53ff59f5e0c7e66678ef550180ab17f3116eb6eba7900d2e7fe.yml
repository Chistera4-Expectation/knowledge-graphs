  While Ranch Dressing and Thousand Island Dressing may have some similarities (they
  are both types of salad dressings), they differ significantly in their ingredients
  and flavor profiles. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Each dressing has its unique characteristics that make
  it distinct from other dressings. Merging these two concepts would result in loss
  of important information about each individual type of dressing.'
