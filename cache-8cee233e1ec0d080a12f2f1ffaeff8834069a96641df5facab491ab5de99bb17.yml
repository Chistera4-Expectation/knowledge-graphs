text: No, Piri Piri sauce and Soy Sauce should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates because they are distinctly different sauces with unique
  ingredients, flavors, and uses. While both are condiments, they have different cultural
  origins and serve different purposes in cooking.
