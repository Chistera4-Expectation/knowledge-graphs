text: No, the instances 'Guinea Fowl Thighs' and 'Ostrich Thighs' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the Poultry-derived
  Food class, they are different types of poultry and should be treated as distinct
  entities within the classification.
