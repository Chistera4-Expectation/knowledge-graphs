  While both corn oil and rice bran oil are types of edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, extraction processes,
  and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Corn oil is typically higher in saturated fats compared
  to rice bran oil, which has a more favorable fatty acid profile with higher levels
  of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Additionally, rice bran oil is extracted
  from the outer layer (bran) of brown rice grains through a solvent extraction process,
  while corn oil is obtained by pressing corn kernels or extracting oil using hexane.
  These differences make each type of oil unique and valuable for different purposes
  in food production and consumption.'
