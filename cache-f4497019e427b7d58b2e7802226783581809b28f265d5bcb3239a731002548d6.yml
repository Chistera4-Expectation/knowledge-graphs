text: As a dietician, I would not recommend merging 'Basil leaves' and 'Scent leaves'
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they may have some similarities,
  they are different herbs with distinct flavors, appearances, and nutritional profiles.
  Basil leaves are from the Ocimum basilicum plant, while scent leaves are from the
  Ocimum gratissimum plant. They can be used in various dishes, but their specific
  uses and flavors differ. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances
  in the Edible Vegetable class.
