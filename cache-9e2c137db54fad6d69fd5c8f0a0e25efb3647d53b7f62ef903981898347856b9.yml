text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of peppers,
  they have distinct characteristics in terms of appearance, flavor, heat level, and
  nutritional content. Green bell peppers are mild and sweet, while habanero peppers
  are spicy and hot. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances in the
  Edible Vegetable class.
