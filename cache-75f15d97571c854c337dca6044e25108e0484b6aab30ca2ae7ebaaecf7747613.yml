  The reason is that "tomato" refers to the whole fruit, while "diced tomatoes" refers
  to the fruit that has been processed into small pieces. While they are related,
  they have different meanings and uses in cooking and nutrition. Therefore, it is
  not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
