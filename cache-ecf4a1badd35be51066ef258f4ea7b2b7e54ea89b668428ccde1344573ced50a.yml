  Although both chili oil and walnut oil are edible vegetable oils, they have different
  ingredients, flavors, uses, and nutritional profiles. Chili oil is typically made
  from crushed red chilies, garlic, vinegar, sesame seeds, and soybean oil, while
  walnut oil comes from pressed walnuts. These distinct differences make them unique
  within the category of edible vegetable oils and mean that they should not be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates.'
