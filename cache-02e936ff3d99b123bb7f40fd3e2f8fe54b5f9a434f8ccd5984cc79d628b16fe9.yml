text: ' No. Feta cheese and Pecorino Romano cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, and they should not be merged together as the same instance. While both
  are types of cheeses, they have distinct characteristics that differentiate them
  from one another. Feta cheese is typically made from sheep''s milk or a mixture
  of goat''s and sheep''s milk, while Pecorino Romano cheese is always made exclusively
  from sheep''s milk. Additionally, they differ in taste, texture, production methods,
  and geographical origins, among other factors. Therefore, it is important to maintain
  separate instances for each type of cheese to accurately represent their unique
  properties and distinguish them from one another.'
