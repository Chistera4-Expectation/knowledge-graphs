text: ' The most adequate class for ''Oils'' would be ''Edible Vegetal Oil''. This
  category includes oils that are derived from plants, such as olive oil, canola oil,
  and sunflower oil. These types of oils are often used in cooking and are considered
  to be a healthier alternative to other types of fats, such as butter or lard. It
  is important to note that while these oils can be part of a healthy diet, they should
  still be consumed in moderation due to their high calorie content.'
