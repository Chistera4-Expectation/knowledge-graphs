text: No, Icelandic Yogurt and Savory Yogurt should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of yogurt, they have different
  characteristics and flavor profiles. Icelandic Yogurt, or Skyr, is a thick and creamy
  yogurt with a mild taste, while Savory Yogurt can encompass a range of flavors,
  such as garlic, herbs, or spices. Therefore, they should be considered distinct
  categories within the broader classification of yogurt.
