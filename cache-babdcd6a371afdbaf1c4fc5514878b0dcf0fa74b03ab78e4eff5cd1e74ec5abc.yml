  'Coriander powder' and 'Coriander' refer to different forms of the same plant, coriander
  (Coriandrum sativum). While they share the same origin, they have distinct culinary
  uses and properties. 'Coriander powder' is the ground form of the seeds, while 'Coriander'
  typically refers to the fresh leaves. Therefore, it is essential to distinguish
  between the two in a dietician context.
