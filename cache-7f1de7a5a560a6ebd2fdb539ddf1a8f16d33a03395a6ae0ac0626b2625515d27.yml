text: ' No. While apple seeds and kiwi seeds are both types of seed, they come from
  different fruit plants (apples and kiwis, respectively) and have different nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. It is important to maintain accurate and specific information about
  each type of food item, including its source plant and unique nutritional properties.'
