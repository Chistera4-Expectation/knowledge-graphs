text: No, the instances 'Apple juice' and 'Beet juice' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of juices derived
  from distinct fruits, and they have different nutritional profiles and properties.
  Merging them would lead to a loss of information and accuracy in the data.
