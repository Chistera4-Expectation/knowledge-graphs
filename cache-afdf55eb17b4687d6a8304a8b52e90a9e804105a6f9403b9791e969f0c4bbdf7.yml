text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Alkaline
  water and purified water have different properties and production methods, which
  make them distinct types of drinking water. Alkaline water has a higher pH level,
  while purified water has gone through a filtration process to remove impurities.
  They serve different purposes and cater to different preferences and needs of consumers.
