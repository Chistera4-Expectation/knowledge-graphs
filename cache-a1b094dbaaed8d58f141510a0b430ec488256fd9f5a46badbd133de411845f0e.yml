text: No, Pheasant Eggs and Pheasant Meatballs should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they both come from the same source (pheasant),
  they are different types of food products. Pheasant Eggs are an egg product, while
  Pheasant Meatballs are a prepared food item made with ground pheasant meat and other
  ingredients. They serve different culinary purposes and have distinct nutritional
  profiles.
