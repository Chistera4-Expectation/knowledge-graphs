  Although Arborio rice is a type of rice that can be cooked and consumed, it has
  different nutritional values and uses compared to cooked rice in general. Therefore,
  they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. It is important to keep them separate
  for accurate nutrition tracking and recipe development purposes.'
