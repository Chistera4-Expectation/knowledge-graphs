text: ' No. While "additional seasonings" and "optional seasonings" might seem similar,
  they can have different meanings depending on the context. "Additional seasonings"
  typically refers to extra seasonings that can be added on top of the basic ones
  for enhanced flavor, while "optional seasonings" may refer to seasonings that are
  not necessary but can be included according to personal preference. Therefore, it
  is beneficial to keep them separate to avoid confusion.'
