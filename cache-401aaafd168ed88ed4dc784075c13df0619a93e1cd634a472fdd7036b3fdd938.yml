text: 'No, these instances should not be merged together. While both are derived from
  the same animal, guinea fowl, they represent different food products and preparations:
  ''Guinea Fowl Patties'' are processed into a patty form, whereas ''Guinea Fowl Stock''
  is a liquid broth made from guinea fowl bones and other ingredients. They are distinct
  food items and should be kept separate in a Poultry-derived Food class.'
