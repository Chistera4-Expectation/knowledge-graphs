  While both rolled oats and oats come from the same source (the whole grain of oat),
  they are not exactly the same thing and do have differences that make them distinct
  from one another. Rolled oats are whole-grain oats that have been steamed and then
  flattened into flakes using large rollers, which gives them a softer texture and
  shorter cooking time compared to unprocessed oats. On the other hand, "oats" typically
  refer to groats, which are the hulled kernels of oats, and require longer cooking
  times than rolled oats. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two
  terms as semantic and ontological duplicates since they represent different stages
  of processing and usage in food preparation.'
