  Chicken broth and chicken pieces are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they refer to different food products with distinct nutritional profiles and uses
  in recipes. Chicken broth is a liquid made by simmering chicken bones, meat, vegetables,
  and seasonings, which provides a source of hydration, electrolytes, and some protein;
  while chicken pieces consist of actual cuts of chicken meat (e.g., breasts, thighs,
  wings) that can vary greatly in their serving size, caloric content, fat, and protein
  levels based on the cut and cooking method used. Therefore, these two instances
  should remain separate within the context of poultry-derived foods.'
