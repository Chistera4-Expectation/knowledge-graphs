text: 'As a dietician, I would not recommend merging ''Drinkable Yogurt'' and ''Probiotic
  Yogurt'' as semantic and ontologic duplicates. These are two distinct types of yogurt
  with different characteristics.


  Drinkable yogurt, also known as yogurt drink or smoothie-style yogurt, is a liquid
  or semi-liquid form of yogurt that can be consumed directly from a container without
  needing to be spooned out. It may or may not contain probiotics.


  Probiotic yogurt, on the other hand, is a type of yogurt that contains live and
  active cultures, specifically probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that can
  help maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria and support digestive health.


  While some drinkable yogurts may be probiotic, not all drinkable yogurts contain
  probiotics, and not all probiotic yogurts are drinkable. Therefore, they should
  not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
