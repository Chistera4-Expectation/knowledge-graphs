text: No, Alfalfa Honey and Orange Blossom Honey should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of honey, they have
  distinct flavors, origins, and properties based on the flowers from which the bees
  gather nectar. Alfalfa Honey comes from alfalfa flowers, while Orange Blossom Honey
  comes from orange blossoms. These differences make them unique and separate entities
  within the Honey class.
