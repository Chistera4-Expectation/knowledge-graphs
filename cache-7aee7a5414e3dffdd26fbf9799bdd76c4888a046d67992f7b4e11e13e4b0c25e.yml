text: No, 'Cooking oil' and 'Sunflower Oil' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While sunflower oil is a type of cooking oil, they are
  not the same thing. Cooking oil is a broader category that includes various types
  of oils used in cooking, such as sunflower oil, olive oil, canola oil, etc. Sunflower
  oil is a specific type of cooking oil derived from sunflower seeds.
