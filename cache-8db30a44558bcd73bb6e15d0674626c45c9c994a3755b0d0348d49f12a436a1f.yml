text: ' No. While Basmati rice is a type of long-grain rice, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they have distinct characteristics beyond their
  shape. For example, Basmati rice has a unique aroma and flavor profile that sets
  it apart from other types of long-grain rice. Therefore, preserving these separate
  labels can help consumers make informed choices about the specific qualities they
  desire in their rice.'
