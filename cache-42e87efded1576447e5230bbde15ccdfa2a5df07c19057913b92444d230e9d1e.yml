text: ' No. Orange Blossom honey and Raw Wildflower honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While they both fall under the category of "honey," they have distinct
  differences in terms of their source (the type of flowers the bees gather nectar
  from) and processing methods (raw vs. pasteurized), which impact their taste, color,
  and nutritional profile. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate
  instances.'
