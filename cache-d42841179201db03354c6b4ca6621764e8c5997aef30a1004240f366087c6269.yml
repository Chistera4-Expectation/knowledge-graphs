text: No, Grapeseed Oil and Pumpkin Seed Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct differences in their nutritional profiles, taste, and uses. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each oil.
