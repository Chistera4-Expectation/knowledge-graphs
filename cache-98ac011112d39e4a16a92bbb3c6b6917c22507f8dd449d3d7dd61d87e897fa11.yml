  While both Kashmiri chili powder and white pepper powder are types of spices, they
  have distinct properties and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Kashmiri chili powder is made from dried red chillies grown in the Kashmir region
  of India and Pakistan. It has a mild heat level with a vibrant red color, making
  it a popular choice for adding flavor and color to dishes without overwhelming them
  with heat.


  On the other hand, white pepper powder comes from the inner seed of mature peppercorns
  after their outer layer has been removed. White pepper has a more subtle and delicate
  flavor compared to black pepper, and it is often used in lighter-colored sauces,
  soups, and creamy dishes where the dark specks of black pepper might be distracting.


  Therefore, despite being both classified as "spices," these two ingredients serve
  different culinary purposes due to their unique flavors and appearances, so merging
  them as duplicates would not accurately reflect their individual roles in food preparation.'
