text: ' No. While "the type of water being consumed" is a description of what kind
  of water someone is drinking (e.g., tap water, bottled water, mineral water), "Water"
  refers to the general concept or category of H2O that exists in various forms, including
  the specific types mentioned. Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  but rather different levels of abstraction within the same domain.'
