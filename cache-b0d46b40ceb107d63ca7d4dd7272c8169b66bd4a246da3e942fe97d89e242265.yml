  While both "Honey" and "Organic Clover Honey" are types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics that make them different from each other. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  "Honey" is a broad term that refers to a sweet substance produced by bees from the
  nectar of flowers. It can come from various floral sources, including clover, alfalfa,
  buckwheat, and many others. On the other hand, "Organic Clover Honey" is a specific
  type of honey made exclusively from the nectar collected from organically grown
  clover plants. Organic certification ensures that the production process meets certain
  standards, such as avoiding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, GMOs, antibiotics,
  and irradiation.


  So, although there may be some overlap between the two concepts, merging them would
  result in loss of important information about their unique features.'
