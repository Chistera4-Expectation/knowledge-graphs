  Porcini mushrooms and Portobello mushrooms are two different species of mushrooms,
  with distinct characteristics, flavors, and textures. While they share some similarities,
  they are not interchangeable and have different culinary uses. Therefore, it is
  not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
