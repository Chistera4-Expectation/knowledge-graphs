  While Italian dressing and Thousand Island dressing may have some similarities (they
  are both types of salad dressings), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Semantically, they have different ingredients and flavors - Italian dressing is
  typically made with olive oil, vinegar, garlic, and herbs, while Thousand Island
  dressing contains mayonnaise, ketchup, sweet pickle relish, and onions. Ontologically,
  they represent distinct categories of food products that serve the same function
  but differ in their composition. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two instances together.'
