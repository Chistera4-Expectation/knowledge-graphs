text: No, 'Mint Tea' and 'White Tea' are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  are different types of tea with distinct flavors and properties. Mint Tea is made
  from mint leaves, while White Tea is made from young or minimally processed tea
  leaves. Although they may both fall under the broader category of tea, they are
  not duplicates.
