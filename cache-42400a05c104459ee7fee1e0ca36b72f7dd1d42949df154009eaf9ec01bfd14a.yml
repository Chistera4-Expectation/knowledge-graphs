text: No, the instances 'Cooking oil' and 'Cooking spray' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct products with different
  properties and uses. Cooking oil is a liquid fat derived from plants, while cooking
  spray is an aerosol can containing a mixture of oil, propellant, and sometimes other
  ingredients, designed for a quick and even coating on cooking surfaces.
