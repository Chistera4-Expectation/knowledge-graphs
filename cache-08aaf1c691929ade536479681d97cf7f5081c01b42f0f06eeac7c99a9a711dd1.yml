text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although they are both poultry-derived food items and both are thighs, they come
  from different types of birds with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses.
  Guinea fowl and quail are different species, and their thighs have unique characteristics,
  making them separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
