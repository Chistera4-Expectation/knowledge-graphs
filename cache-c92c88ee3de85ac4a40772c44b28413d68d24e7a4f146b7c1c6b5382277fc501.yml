text: ' "Energy Drink" or "Sports Drink" would be the most adequate classes for electrolyte
  beverages. These types of drinks are specifically formulated to replenish fluids
  and electrolytes, especially those lost through sweat during physical activity.
  Alcoholic drinks, coffee, drinking water, edible vegetable oil, honey, juice, milk,
  and tea do not fit this description as they do not contain significant amounts of
  electrolytes in the same way that energy drinks do.'
