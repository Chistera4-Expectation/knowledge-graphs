text: ' No. Honey Mustard Dressing and Soy Sauce Dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. While both may be used as dressings, they have distinct ingredients
  and flavors. Honey Mustard Dressing typically contains honey, mustard, vinegar,
  and oil, among other ingredients, resulting in a sweet and tangy flavor. Soy Sauce
  Dressing, on the other hand, is primarily made of soy sauce, which has a savory
  umami taste. Therefore, they represent different types of dressings with unique
  characteristics.'
