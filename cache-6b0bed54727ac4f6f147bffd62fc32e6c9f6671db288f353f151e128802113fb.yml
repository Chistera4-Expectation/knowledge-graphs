text: No, they should not be merged as they have different nutritional compositions
  and cooking methods. Duck gizzards are mainly muscle tissue and are often grilled
  or fried, while duck patties are made from ground duck meat and can be cooked in
  various ways, such as grilling or pan-frying. Therefore, they should not be considered
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
