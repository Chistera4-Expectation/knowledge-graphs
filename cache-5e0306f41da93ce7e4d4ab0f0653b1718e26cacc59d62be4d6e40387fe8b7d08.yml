text: No, they should not be merged. While both "Diced tomatoes" and "Potatoes" are
  edible vegetables, they are distinct and separate entities with unique properties,
  nutritional values, and uses in recipes. Merging them would result in a loss of
  information and could lead to confusion when providing dietary advice.
