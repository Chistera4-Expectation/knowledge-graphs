text: No, the instances 'Sea Spiders' and 'Spider Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they share similar names, they belong
  to different taxonomic groups. Sea spiders are arthropods, specifically marine chelicerates,
  while spider crabs are crustaceans, specifically belonging to the family Majidae.
  They are not duplicates in terms of their classification or characteristics.
