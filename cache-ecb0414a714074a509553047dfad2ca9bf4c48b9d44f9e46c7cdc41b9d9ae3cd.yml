text: ' No. Although rice bran oil and soybean oil are both types of edible vegetable
  oils, they have distinct properties, nutritional profiles, and production processes
  that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
