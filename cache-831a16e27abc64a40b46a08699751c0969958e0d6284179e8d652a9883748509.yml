  While both Fresh Mozzarella and Mozzarella are types of cheese, they differ in taste,
  texture, and production methods. Fresh Mozzarella is a soft, moist cheese with a
  milky flavor and is typically made from buffalo or cow's milk, while Mozzarella
  can be made from cow's, buffalo's, or sheep's milk and can vary in texture from
  soft to semi-firm. Therefore, I would not recommend merging these two instances
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates, as they have distinct characteristics.
