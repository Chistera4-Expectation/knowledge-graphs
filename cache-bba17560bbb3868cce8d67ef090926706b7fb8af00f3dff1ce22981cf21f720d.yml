  Although Adobo seasoning and Italian Seasoning may both fall under the general category
  of "food seasonings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they
  contain different ingredients and are used to flavor distinct types of dishes. Adobo
  seasoning is typically made up of garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, turmeric,
  paprika, cumin, and black pepper, and it is commonly used in Mexican and Filipino
  cuisine. On the other hand, Italian Seasoning is usually a blend of basil, oregano,
  rosemary, thyme, and marjoram, and it is often used in Italian-American cooking.
  Therefore, these two seasonings have unique properties and uses that warrant them
  being treated as separate entities.'
