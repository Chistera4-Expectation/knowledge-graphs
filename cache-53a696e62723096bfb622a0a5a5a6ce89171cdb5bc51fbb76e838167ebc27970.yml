text: ' No. Rice vinegar and white vinegar are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they can both be used for food seasoning, they have different tastes, appearances,
  and acidity levels due to their distinct production processes. Therefore, it is
  essential to maintain them as separate entities with unique properties.'
