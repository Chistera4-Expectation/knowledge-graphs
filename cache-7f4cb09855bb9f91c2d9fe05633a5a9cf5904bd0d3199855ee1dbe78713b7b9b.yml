text: No, the instances "Chicken Patties" and "Chicken Stock" should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different food products
  derived from chicken with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Chicken
  patties are formed, cooked chicken meat, while chicken stock is a liquid made by
  simmering chicken bones and/or meat.
