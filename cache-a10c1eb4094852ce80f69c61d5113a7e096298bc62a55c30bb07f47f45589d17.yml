text: No, Pork Shank and Pork Tenderloin should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from pork, they are distinct cuts
  of meat with different characteristics, culinary uses, and nutritional profiles.
  Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and detail in describing the
  food items.
