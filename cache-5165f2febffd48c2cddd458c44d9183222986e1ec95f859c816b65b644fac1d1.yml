text: No, "Duck Soup" and "Duck Stock" should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are derived from ducks, they have distinct
  culinary uses and properties. Duck soup is a liquid dish typically made with meat
  from a duck, while duck stock is a flavorful liquid used as a base for various dishes,
  made by simmering duck bones, meat, and aromatics. Therefore, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates.
