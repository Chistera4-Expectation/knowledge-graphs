text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both "Duck Drumsticks" and "Duck Tenders" are derived from ducks, they are
  different cuts of meat with distinct characteristics, cooking methods, and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, they should be considered as separate instances within the
  Poultry-derived Food class.
