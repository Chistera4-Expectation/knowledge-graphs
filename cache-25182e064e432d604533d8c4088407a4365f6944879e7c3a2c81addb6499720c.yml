  The amount of protein and the amount of sugar are distinct nutritional components
  found in juices, each with their own unique health implications. Therefore, it is
  appropriate to keep these two attributes separate rather than merging them into
  a single attribute. This allows for clearer tracking and analysis of both the protein
  and sugar content of different juices, which can support more informed decision-making
  regarding healthy choices.'
