text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of yogurt, they
  have distinct characteristics and cultural origins that differentiate them. Australian
  yogurt may have unique ingredients or flavor profiles compared to Greek yogurt,
  and vice versa. Merging them would result in loss of information about their individual
  properties.
