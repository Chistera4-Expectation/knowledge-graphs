text: No, the instances 'Horseshoe Crab' and 'King Crab' should not be merged together
  as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Horseshoe Crabs belong to the
  subphylum Chelicerata and are more closely related to spiders and scorpions than
  to crabs. On the other hand, King Crabs belong to the subphylum Crustacea and are
  true crustaceans, closely related to other crabs and lobsters. Therefore, they belong
  to different classes and should not be merged.
