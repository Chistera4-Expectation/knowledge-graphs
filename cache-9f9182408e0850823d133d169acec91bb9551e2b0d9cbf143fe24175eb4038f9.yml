text: No, 'Blueberry Honey' and 'Pine Honey' should not be merged as they are distinct
  types of honey derived from different sources (blueberry blossoms and pine tree
  blossoms, respectively). Although they are both types of honey, they maintain unique
  characteristics and properties, making them separate instances in the Honey class.
