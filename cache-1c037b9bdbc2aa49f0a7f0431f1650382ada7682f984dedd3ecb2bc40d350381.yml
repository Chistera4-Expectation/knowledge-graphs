text: As a dietician, I cannot give a definitive yes or no answer without a thorough
  understanding of the specific context and classification system you are using. However,
  if 'Lavender Honey' and 'Pine Honey' are indeed semantic and ontologic duplicates,
  they should be merged together to avoid confusion and redundancy. It is essential
  to have clear definitions and classifications to ensure accurate information and
  proper dietary guidance.
