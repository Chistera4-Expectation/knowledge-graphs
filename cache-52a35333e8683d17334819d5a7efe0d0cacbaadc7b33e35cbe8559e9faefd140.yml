  Merging the instances of 'Mustard sauce' and 'sour sauce' as semantic and ontological
  duplicates would not be accurate, as they have different ingredients and flavor
  profiles. Mustard sauce typically contains mustard, vinegar, oil, and seasonings,
  while sour sauce may have ingredients like vinegar, sugar, and various spices, resulting
  in distinct tastes and uses in cooking.
