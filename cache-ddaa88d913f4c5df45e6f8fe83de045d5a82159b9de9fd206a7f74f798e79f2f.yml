text: No, Chai Tea and Earl Grey Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of tea, they have distinct flavors, ingredients,
  and cultural associations. Chai Tea originates from India and is typically made
  with black tea, milk, and a mixture of spices, while Earl Grey Tea is a black tea
  flavored with bergamot oil and has a British origin. The differences in their composition,
  preparation, and cultural background make them unique and separate entities in the
  context of a Tea class.
