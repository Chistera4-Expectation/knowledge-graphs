text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are meatballs derived
  from poultry, chicken and quail are distinct types of poultry, and the nutritional
  content, flavor, and culinary uses may differ. Therefore, it is essential to maintain
  separate instances for 'Chicken Meatballs' and 'Quail Meatballs' in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
