text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food with distinct properties and uses. "Ostrich Nuggets" are a processed food product
  made from ostrich meat, while "Ostrich Stock" is a liquid made from simmering ostrich
  bones, meat, or vegetables, typically used as a base for soups or sauces.
