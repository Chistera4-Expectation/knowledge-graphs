text: No, Buffalo Milk and Cashew Milk should not be merged together as they are different
  types of milk. Buffalo Milk is an animal-derived milk, while Cashew Milk is a plant-based
  milk alternative. They have different nutritional profiles, and categorizing them
  together would not accurately represent their unique characteristics.
