  While chili peppers and white pepper are both types of spices, they have different
  flavors, appearances, and uses in cooking. Chili peppers come from various plants
  in the Capsicum genus and contain capsaicin, which gives them their heat. In contrast,
  white pepper comes from the inner seed of dried fruit from Piper nigrum (black pepper)
  and has a milder flavor compared to chili peppers. Therefore, they should not be
  considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
