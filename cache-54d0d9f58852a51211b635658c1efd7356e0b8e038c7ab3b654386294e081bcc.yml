text: No, Arborio Rice and Short-grain Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both short-grain rice varieties, they have
  distinct characteristics and uses in cooking. Arborio Rice is a short-grain Italian
  rice that is known for its high starch content and is typically used in risotto
  dishes. Short-grain Rice, on the other hand, is a broader category that includes
  various rice varieties from different regions, which may have different cooking
  properties and uses in recipes. Therefore, they should not be merged as duplicates.
