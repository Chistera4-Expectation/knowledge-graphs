text: As a dietician, I would say that while ostrich broth and ostrich stock may be
  similar in concept, they are not necessarily semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Broth typically refers to a liquid in which meat or vegetables have been cooked
  and then strained, while stock usually refers to a liquid that has been simmered
  with bones, vegetables, and seasonings for a longer period of time to extract more
  flavor and nutrients. Therefore, they are distinct food products with subtle differences
  in preparation and composition.
