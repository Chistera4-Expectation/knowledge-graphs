  As a dietitian, I can explain that "herb butter" and "lemon butter" are not duplicate
  concepts. They are two distinct types of butter with different flavors and uses
  in cooking. While they share some similarities as types of butter, they have different
  ingredients and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them
  separate rather than merging them as duplicates.'
