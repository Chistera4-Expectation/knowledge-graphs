text: ' No. Seafood is a general term that refers to all edible fish and shellfish,
  while seafood for frying typically refers to specific types of seafood that are
  suitable for frying (e.g., shrimp, squid, white fish). Therefore, they have different
  meanings and serve distinct purposes in classification and description, so they
  should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
