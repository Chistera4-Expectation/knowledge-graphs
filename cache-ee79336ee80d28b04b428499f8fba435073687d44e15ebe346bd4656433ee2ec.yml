text: No, they should not be merged together. While they both fall under the category
  of edible seeds, 'Flax Seeds' and 'Seeds' are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  'Flax Seeds' is a specific type of seed, while 'Seeds' is a more general term encompassing
  various types of seeds. Merging them would result in a loss of specificity and accuracy
  in classification.
