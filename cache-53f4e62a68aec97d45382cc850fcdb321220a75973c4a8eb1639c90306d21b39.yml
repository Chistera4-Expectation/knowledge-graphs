  Although both "Quail Patties" and "Quail" are derived from the same bird, they represent
  different food items. "Quail Patties" refers to a specific preparation of quail
  meat (likely ground and formed into patties), while "Quail" refers to the meat from
  the bird itself, which can be prepared in various ways. Therefore, they are distinct
  instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
