text: No, the instances 'Gluten-Free Bread' and 'Rye Bread' should not be merged together
  as they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. While both are types of bread,
  they differ in their ingredients and characteristics. Gluten-Free Bread does not
  contain gluten, which makes it suitable for people with gluten intolerance or celiac
  disease. Rye Bread, on the other hand, is made with rye flour and may contain gluten.
  Therefore, they serve different dietary needs and purposes.
