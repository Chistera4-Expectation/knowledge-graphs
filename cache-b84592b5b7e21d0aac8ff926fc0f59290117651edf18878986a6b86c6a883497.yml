  While both garlic paste and miso paste can function as food seasonings, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different ingredients,
  flavors, uses, and origins. Garlic paste is made primarily from crushed garlic cloves
  and has a pungent flavor, while miso paste consists of fermented soybeans and rice
  or barley and imparts a rich umami taste. These distinctions make them unique within
  their category and essential for various culinary applications.'
