text: No, Potatoes and Sweet potatoes should not be merged together as they belong
  to different botanical families and have distinct nutritional profiles. Potatoes
  (Solanum tuberosum) are part of the nightshade family, while Sweet potatoes (Ipomoea
  batatas) are part of the morning glory family. Although they share some common characteristics,
  they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
