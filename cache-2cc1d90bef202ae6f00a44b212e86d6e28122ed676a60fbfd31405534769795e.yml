  While red pepper flakes and white pepper powder may both be types of spices and
  contain capsaicin (which gives them their heat), they come from different parts
  of the plant and have different flavor profiles. Red pepper flakes are made from
  dried and crushed red chili peppers, while white pepper is made by removing the
  outer husk of ripe black peppercorns before drying. As a result, they differ in
  taste, appearance, and culinary uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to
  merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
