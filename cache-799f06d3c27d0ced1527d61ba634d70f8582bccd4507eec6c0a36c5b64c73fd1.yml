text: No, 'Ostrich Gizzards' and 'Ostrich Gravy' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from ostriches,
  they are different food items with distinct characteristics and uses. 'Ostrich Gizzards'
  refers to the muscle found in the digestive system of the ostrich, while 'Ostrich
  Gravy' is a sauce made from the drippings and juices of cooked ostrich meat. These
  are separate food items with unique properties, preparation methods, and nutritional
  values.
