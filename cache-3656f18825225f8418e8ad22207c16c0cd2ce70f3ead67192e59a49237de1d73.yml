text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of yogurt, they have
  distinct characteristics and production methods. Frozen yogurt is a frozen dessert
  made from yogurt, while Skyr yogurt is a traditional Icelandic dairy product with
  a thicker consistency and higher protein content. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the unique qualities of each type of yogurt.
