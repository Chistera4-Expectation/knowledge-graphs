  "Other plant-based milks such as oat milk" is a category of non-dairy beverages
  made from plants, while "pasteurization\_method" refers to a specific process used
  to treat dairy milk to kill bacteria and extend its shelf life. These two concepts
  are not duplicates and serve different purposes in describing the characteristics
  of various types of milk products.'
