text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of bread, they
  are distinct in their cultural origins, ingredients, and preparation methods. Cuban
  bread is a traditional bread from Cuba, made with lard or vegetable shortening,
  and typically baked in long, thin loaves. Naan bread, on the other hand, is a flatbread
  from South Asia, made with flour, yogurt, and ghee or oil, and typically baked in
  a tandoor oven. These differences warrant separate classifications within the Bread
  class.
