text: No, Coriander powder and Curry Powder should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are spices, they have distinct ingredients and flavor
  profiles. Coriander powder is made from ground coriander seeds, while Curry Powder
  is a blend of various spices, such as turmeric, coriander, cumin, and chili powder,
  among others.
