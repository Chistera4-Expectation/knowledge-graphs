text: ' No. Tomato paste and tomatoes are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they come from the same fruit (botanically speaking). They have different
  nutritional profiles, textures, uses, and culinary applications. Merging them would
  result in loss of important distinctions for users seeking specific information
  about these food items.'
