  While both Guinea Fowl Meatballs and Guinea Fowl Nuggets are derived from the same
  protein source (guinea fowl), they are different food products with distinct preparation
  methods and possibly different nutritional values. Therefore, they should be considered
  separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
