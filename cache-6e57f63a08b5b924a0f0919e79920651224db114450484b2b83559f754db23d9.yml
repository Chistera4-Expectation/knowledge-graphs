text: No, the instances 'Goat cheese' and 'Gouda cheese' should not be merged together
  as they are different types of cheese made from different types of milk. Goat cheese
  is made from goat's milk, while Gouda cheese is made from cow's milk. They have
  distinct characteristics, flavors, and textures, which make them unique and not
  duplicates.
