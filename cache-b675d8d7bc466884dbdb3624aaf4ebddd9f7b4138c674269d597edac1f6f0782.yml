text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from chicken,
  they are different food items with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking.
  Chicken stock is a liquid made by boiling chicken bones and vegetables, while chicken
  tenders are a cut of chicken meat typically served as a main dish or used in recipes.
