text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'Coconut sugar' and 'Sugar'
  are sweeteners, they have distinct properties, nutritional values, and sources.
  'Coconut sugar' is derived from the sap of the coconut palm, while 'Sugar' typically
  refers to refined white sugar, which is made from sugarcane or sugar beets. It's
  essential to maintain separate instances to accurately represent these differences
  in a dietary context.
