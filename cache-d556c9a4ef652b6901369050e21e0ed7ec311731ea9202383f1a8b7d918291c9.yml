text: No, 'Cumin powder' and 'Cumin seeds' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are different forms of the same spice, but they have distinct properties
  and uses in cooking and nutrition. Cumin seeds can be toasted and ground for use
  in powder form, but the two forms have different textures, flavors, and potential
  nutritional benefits.
