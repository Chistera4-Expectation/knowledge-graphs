text: No, 'Grape juice' and 'Key lime juice' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both are types of juices, they have different ingredients,
  flavors, and nutritional profiles. Merging them would result in a loss of information
  and clarity about the specific types of juice being discussed.
