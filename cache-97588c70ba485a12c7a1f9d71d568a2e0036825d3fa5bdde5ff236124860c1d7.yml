text: ' No. Fresh mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese are not semantic and
  ontological duplicates, and they should not be merged together as the same instance.
  While both are types of cheese, they have distinct characteristics, uses, and nutritional
  profiles that make them unique. Merging these two instances would result in loss
  of important information and lead to confusion.'
