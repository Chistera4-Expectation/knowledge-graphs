  Baking powder and onion powder are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they have different properties, uses, and effects on food. Baking powder is a chemical
  leavening agent used to help baked goods rise, while onion powder is a seasoning
  made from dehydrated onions that is used to add flavor to dishes. They belong to
  different categories of food ingredients and serve distinct purposes in cooking
  and baking.'
