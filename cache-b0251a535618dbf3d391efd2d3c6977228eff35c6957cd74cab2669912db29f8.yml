text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of honey, they
  are derived from different floral sources and have distinct characteristics. Sunflower
  Honey comes from bees collecting nectar from sunflower plants, while Wildflower
  Honey is produced from bees visiting a variety of wildflowers. These differences
  make them unique and not semantic or ontological duplicates.
