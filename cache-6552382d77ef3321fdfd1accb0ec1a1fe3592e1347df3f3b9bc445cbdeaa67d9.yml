text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both Australian Yogurt and
  Skyr Yogurt are types of yogurt, they have distinct properties and origins. Australian
  Yogurt is a type of yogurt produced in Australia, while Skyr Yogurt is a traditional
  Icelandic dairy product with a thicker consistency and higher protein content. Merging
  them as duplicates would ignore these unique characteristics.
