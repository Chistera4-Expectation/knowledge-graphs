  While both "additional seasonings" and "optional ingredients" may seem similar,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to different
  aspects of food preparation.


  "Additional seasonings" generally refers to flavor enhancers that can be added to
  a dish to make it taste better, such as salt, pepper, herbs, or spices. These items
  are typically used to add depth and complexity to the existing flavors in the recipe.


  On the other hand, "optional ingredients" usually refers to any ingredient listed
  in a recipe that is not essential for preparing the dish. This could include items
  like nuts, cheese, or even entire components of the recipe that some people might
  choose to omit due to personal preference or dietary restrictions.


  Therefore, while there may be some overlap between these two categories (for example,
  certain optional ingredients could also function as additional seasonings), they
  are distinct concepts with their own specific meanings.'
