text: No, "Duck Drumsticks" and "Guinea Fowl Drumsticks" should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they share the term "drumsticks" and are both
  poultry-derived, they are distinct types of poultry with unique nutritional profiles
  and culinary characteristics. Merging them would not accurately represent their
  differences.
