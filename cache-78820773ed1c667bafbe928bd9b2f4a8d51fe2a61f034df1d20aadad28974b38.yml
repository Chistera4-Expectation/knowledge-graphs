  While both "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Chicken Soup" are poultry-derived foods that
  contain chicken, they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because
  they have different ingredients, preparation methods, textures, tastes, nutritional
  profiles, and culinary uses. Merging them would not accurately represent their distinct
  identities in the food classification system.'
