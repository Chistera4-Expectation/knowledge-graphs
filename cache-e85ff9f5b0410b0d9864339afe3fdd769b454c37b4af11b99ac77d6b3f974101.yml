text: No, Hemp Milk and Rice Milk should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both plant-based milk alternatives, they have different
  nutritional profiles, flavors, and consistencies. Hemp Milk is higher in protein
  and healthy fats, while Rice Milk is lower in fat and higher in carbohydrates. Merging
  them would not accurately represent their unique characteristics and uses in various
  dietary contexts.
