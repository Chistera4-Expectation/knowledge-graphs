  Flaxseed oil and rice bran oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, but they
  have different nutritional profiles, properties, and uses, so they should not be
  merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Flaxseed oil is high in omega-3 fatty
  acids and has a low smoke point, making it suitable for salad dressings and drizzling
  over foods, while rice bran oil has a high smoke point and contains antioxidants
  like vitamin E and ferulic acid, which makes it ideal for high-heat cooking methods
  such as frying. Therefore, they are distinct from each other and serve unique purposes
  in culinary applications.'
