text: ' No, green onions and green peas are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Although they both have "green" in their names, they belong to different categories
  of vegetables and possess distinct nutritional profiles, flavors, textures, and
  uses in cooking. Green onions (also known as scallions) are members of the Allium
  family and resemble small onions with long, thin green leaves. In contrast, green
  peas are part of the legume family and come in round, green pods containing several
  individual peas inside. Merging these two instances would lead to confusion and
  incorrect assumptions about their properties and roles in diets.'
