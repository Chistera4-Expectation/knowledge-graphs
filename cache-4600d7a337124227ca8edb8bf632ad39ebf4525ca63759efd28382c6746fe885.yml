text: No, Pumpkin Seed Oil and Walnut Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have different properties,
  nutritional values, and uses. Therefore, they should be treated as separate entities
  in a dietician's classification system.
