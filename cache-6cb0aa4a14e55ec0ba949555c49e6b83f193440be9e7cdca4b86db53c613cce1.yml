text: No, the instances 'Cremini Mushroom' and 'White Button Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types
  of mushrooms, they have distinct characteristics and properties. Cremini mushrooms
  are more mature versions of white button mushrooms, with a deeper, earthier flavor
  and firmer texture. White button mushrooms, on the other hand, are younger and have
  a milder flavor. Therefore, they should be kept separate in a classification system.
