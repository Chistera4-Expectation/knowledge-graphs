text: As a dietician, I would recommend considering the nutritional and flavor differences
  between enchilada sauce and other sauces. They can have different ingredients, such
  as chili peppers and spices in enchilada sauce, which may affect their nutritional
  content and how they fit into a balanced diet. While they are both sauces, they
  have distinct properties and uses. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontologic duplicates in this context.
