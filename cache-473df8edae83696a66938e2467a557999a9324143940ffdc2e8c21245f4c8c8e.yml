text: "As a dietician, I can provide an informed perspective on this topic. From a\
  \ culinary standpoint, \"Italian seasoning\" and \"seasoning\" are not semantic\
  \ or ontologic duplicates. \n\n\"Italian seasoning\" is a specific blend of herbs\
  \ and spices commonly used in Italian cuisine, typically consisting of basil, oregano,\
  \ thyme, rosemary, and sometimes other ingredients like garlic or red pepper flakes.\
  \ \n\nOn the other hand, \"seasoning\" is a general term that encompasses a wide\
  \ variety of herbs, spices, and condiments used to enhance the flavor of food. This\
  \ could include salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, or any other spice or herb.\
  \ \n\nWhile both terms relate to the concept of flavoring food, they are not interchangeable\
  \ because \"Italian seasoning\" has a specific combination of ingredients and is\
  \ used for a specific cuisine, whereas \"seasoning\" is a broader term encompassing\
  \ various flavors and cuisines."
