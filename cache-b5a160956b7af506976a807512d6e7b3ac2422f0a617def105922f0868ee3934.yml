  The two instances, "Boneless, skinless chicken breast" and "Chicken soup," are not
  identical in terms of their composition, preparation method, and nutritional content.
  While they both contain chicken, they differ in various aspects that make them distinct
  entities in the context of a poultry-derived food classification system. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate rather than merging them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.'
