text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct ingredients and flavor profiles.
  Brown sauce typically contains tomatoes, vinegar, and spices, while Scotch bonnet
  pepper sauce is characterized by the use of Scotch bonnet peppers, which are significantly
  spicier than the ingredients in brown sauce. Although both are sauces, they have
  different properties and should be kept as separate instances.
