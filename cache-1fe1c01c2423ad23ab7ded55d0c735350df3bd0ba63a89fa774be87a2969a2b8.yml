text: ' No. Cherry Blossom Honey and Raw Wildflower Honey are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, despite both being types of honey. They come from different floral sources
  and may have distinct flavor profiles, textures, and nutritional properties. Therefore,
  they should remain separate classes representing their unique characteristics.'
