text: No, alkaline water and oxygenated water should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of drinking water, they have different
  properties and characteristics. Alkaline water has a higher pH level, which may
  affect its taste and potential health benefits, while oxygenated water has added
  oxygen molecules, which may enhance its refreshing sensation and potential health
  benefits. Merging them as duplicates would disregard their distinct properties and
  potential benefits.
