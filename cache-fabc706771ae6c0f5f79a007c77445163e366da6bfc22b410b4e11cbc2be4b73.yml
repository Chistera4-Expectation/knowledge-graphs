text: No, Goat meat and Quail Meatballs should not be merged together as they are
  different types of poultry-derived food. Goat meat is a type of red meat from goats,
  while Quail Meatballs are a specific dish made from quail meat, which is a type
  of poultry. They may both fall under the Poultry-derived Food class, but they are
  not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
