text: No, Savory Yogurt and Vegan Yogurt should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are distinct types of yogurt based on flavor and
  ingredients, respectively. Savory Yogurt refers to yogurt with savory flavors like
  garlic or herbs, while Vegan Yogurt refers to yogurt made from plant-based ingredients
  (e.g., soy, coconut, or almond milk) instead of dairy.
