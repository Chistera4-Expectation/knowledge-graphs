  While both "chicken pieces" and "rotisserie chicken" are types of poultry-derived
  food, they have distinct differences in terms of preparation, presentation, and
  nutritional content. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Here are some reasons why:


  1. Preparation method: Chicken pieces can refer to various parts of the bird (such
  as breasts, legs, wings) that may be cooked using different methods like grilling,
  frying, baking, boiling, etc. On the other hand, rotisserie chickens are typically
  seasoned, then slow-cooked on a spit over an open flame or convection heat, resulting
  in a unique flavor profile and texture.

  2. Presentation: Rotisserie chickens are often sold whole, whereas chicken pieces
  come in individual portions. This difference affects how consumers purchase, prepare,
  and consume these products.

  3. Nutritional content: The nutritional values for chicken pieces and rotisserie
  chickens will vary depending on factors such as cooking methods, ingredients used,
  and portion sizes. For instance, rotisserie chickens may contain added oils, salts,
  or sugars due to marinades or seasonings, while plain chicken pieces might not.
  As a result, their caloric intake, fat, sodium, and sugar levels could differ significantly.

  4. Contextual usage: People use these two items differently in recipes or meal planning
  because of their inherent properties. A recipe calling for shredded chicken would
  require pre-cooked chicken pieces rather than raw ones, but a rotisserie chicken
  would work perfectly fine if available. Similarly, when preparing meals for guests,
  one might opt for a visually appealing rotisserie chicken instead of simple chicken
  pieces.

  5. Consumer preferences: Some individuals prefer the convenience of buying a ready-to-eat
  rotisserie chicken, while others enjoy selecting specific cuts of meat based on
  personal preference. These varying consumer needs highlight another reason why treating
  these items as semantically equivalent does not adequately reflect reality.'
