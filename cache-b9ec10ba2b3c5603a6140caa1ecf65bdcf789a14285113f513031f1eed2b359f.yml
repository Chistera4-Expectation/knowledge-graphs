  Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and Maggi seasoning cubes are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, as they have different properties and uses in food preparation. Baking
  soda is primarily used as a leavening agent to help baked goods rise, while Maggi
  seasoning cubes serve as flavor enhancers for various dishes such as soups, stews,
  and sauces. They belong to distinct categories of ingredients with unique functionalities
  in cooking.'
