text: No, the instances 'Wonton wrappers' and 'habanero pepper' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of food
  items, one being a type of dough used in Chinese cuisine, and the other being a
  spicy pepper. They do not share the same properties or uses in a culinary context.
