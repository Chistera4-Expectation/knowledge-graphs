  Although both are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics and nutritional
  profiles. Icelandic yogurt (also known as skyr) is typically higher in protein and
  lower in sugar compared to plain yogurt, and the two have different textures and
  flavor profiles. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique qualities.
