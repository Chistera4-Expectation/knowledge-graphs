text: As a dietician, my answer is no. While both "other vegetables for variation"
  and "vegetable stock" are related to vegetables, they serve different purposes in
  a diet. "Other vegetables for variation" refers to a variety of vegetables that
  can be used in a meal to add nutrients, flavors, and textures, while "vegetable
  stock" is a liquid base made from simmering vegetables and used as a flavor enhancer
  in soups, stews, and other dishes. These are distinct concepts and should not be
  merged as semantic or ontological duplicates.
