text: ' No. While both Blue Cheese Dressing and Creamy Italian Dressing may share
  some similarities in terms of being creamy dressings, they are distinct food items
  with unique ingredients and flavors. Blue Cheese Dressing is characterized by its
  use of blue cheese, while Creamy Italian Dressing typically includes ingredients
  such as olive oil, vinegar, garlic, and herbs for an Italian flavor. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
