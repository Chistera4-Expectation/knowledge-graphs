text: As a dietician, my focus is on nutrition and dietary advice, not on classifications
  of sauces. However, from a programming perspective, if 'Chimichurri sauce' is a
  specific type of sauce and 'Sauce' is a more general category, then they should
  not be merged as they are not duplicates. They represent different levels of specificity
  in the classification of sauces.
