text: No, Cream and Sour cream should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both dairy products, they have different properties and
  uses in cooking and baking. Cream is a high-fat dairy product that is often whipped
  or used as a base for sauces and desserts, while sour cream is a fermented dairy
  product with a tangy flavor and is commonly used as a condiment or ingredient in
  dishes like dips, sauces, and baked goods.
