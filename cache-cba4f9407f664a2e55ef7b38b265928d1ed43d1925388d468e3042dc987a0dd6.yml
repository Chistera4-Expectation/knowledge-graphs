  While curry powder and five-spice powder are both types of seasonings used in cooking,
  they have different ingredients and uses in recipes. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Curry powder typically includes
  spices such as turmeric, coriander, cumin, fenugreek, and chili peppers, while five-spice
  powder usually contains star anise, cloves, Chinese cinnamon, sichuan pepper, and
  fennel seeds. These distinct differences make them unique from one another and essential
  for various dishes.'
