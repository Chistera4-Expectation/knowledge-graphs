text: As a dietician, I would advise against merging the instances 'Boneless, skinless
  chicken breasts' and 'Chicken Breast' together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While they both refer to the same part of the chicken, the terms convey different
  information. 'Boneless, skinless chicken breasts' is more specific, detailing that
  the skin has been removed and the bones have been taken out. In contrast, 'Chicken
  Breast' could refer to either boneless or bone-in chicken breast with or without
  the skin. Thus, they should not be considered as duplicates.
