text: No, Lotus Leaf and Waterleaf are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Although
  both are edible vegetable leaves, they belong to different plant species and have
  distinct characteristics. Lotus Leaf comes from the lotus plant, while Waterleaf
  is a common name for several plants with edible leaves, such as Talinum triangulare.
  Merging them as duplicates would not accurately represent the variety of edible
  vegetable leaves available.
