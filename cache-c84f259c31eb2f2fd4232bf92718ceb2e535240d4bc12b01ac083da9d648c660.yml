  Black rice and short-grain rice are not semantic or ontological duplicates and should
  not be merged. They belong to different categories of rice: black rice is known
  for its dark color and high antioxidant content, while short-grain rice has a starchy,
  sticky texture popular in dishes like sushi. Although they have distinct characteristics,
  both can still fall under the general category of "rice."'
