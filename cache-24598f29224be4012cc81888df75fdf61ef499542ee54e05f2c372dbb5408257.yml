  While rice bran oil and sesame oil may both fall under the broader category of edible
  vegetable oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct
  chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, flavors, uses, and cultural significance.
  Therefore, it is important to maintain separate instances for each type of oil in
  order to accurately represent their unique properties and characteristics.'
