  Chai tea and Yerba mate tea are two different types of teas with distinct ingredients,
  flavors, and cultural associations. Chai tea is a spiced tea that originated in
  India and typically includes black tea, milk, sugar, and spices such as cinnamon,
  cardamom, and ginger. Yerba mate tea, on the other hand, is made from the leaves
  of the South American holly tree and has a slightly bitter, earthy flavor. It is
  traditionally consumed from a shared straw in social settings in Argentina, Uruguay,
  and southern Brazil. While both teas have some similarities, they are not identical
  and can be considered separate entities. Therefore, they should not be merged as
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
