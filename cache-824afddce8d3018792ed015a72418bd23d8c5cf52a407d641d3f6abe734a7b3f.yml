text: 'No, they should not be merged together. Although they both involve cheese,
  they serve different purposes in the context of a recipe or meal. "Cheddar cheese"
  refers to a specific type of cheese used in the dish, while "Optional: additional
  cheese for topping" indicates an optional ingredient that can be added on top of
  the dish for extra flavor or texture. They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates
  as they have different meanings and purposes.'
