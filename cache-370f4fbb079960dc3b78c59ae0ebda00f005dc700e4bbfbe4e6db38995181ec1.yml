  While both cantaloupe seeds and sesame seeds fall under the broader category of
  edible seeds, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct
  characteristics such as size, shape, taste, nutritional profiles, culinary uses,
  etc., which make them unique from each other. Therefore, it is appropriate to maintain
  these two instances separately within the Edible Seeds class.'
