  The instance ": The base ingredient of the sauce" represents a single ingredient
  that is used as the foundation for creating a sauce, while "Sauce" refers to the
  finished product created by combining multiple ingredients (including the base ingredient).
  Therefore, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates.'
