text: As a dietician, I would say no, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Green tea and lavender tea are different types of tea with distinct
  properties, flavors, and potential health benefits. Although both are teas, they
  are not semantically or ontologically equivalent. Green tea is made from the leaves
  of Camellia sinensis and is known for its high antioxidant content, while lavender
  tea is made from the flowers of Lavandula angustifolia and is known for its calming
  and soothing properties.
