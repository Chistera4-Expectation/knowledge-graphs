text: No, Lobster and Squat Lobster should not be merged as they are different species
  and have distinct nutritional profiles. Lobster refers to a marine crustacean from
  the Nephropidae family, while Squat Lobster belongs to the Galatheidae family. Although
  they share some similarities, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
