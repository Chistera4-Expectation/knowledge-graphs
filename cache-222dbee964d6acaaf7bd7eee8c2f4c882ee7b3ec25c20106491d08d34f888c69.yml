text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of water with distinct
  properties. Electrolyte water typically contains added electrolytes such as sodium,
  potassium, and magnesium, while oxygenated water contains dissolved oxygen. These
  differences make them distinct types of water with separate purposes and benefits.
