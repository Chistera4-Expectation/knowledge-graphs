text: No, "Duck Sausage" and "Quail Sausage" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are sausages made from poultry, they are
  derived from different birds and may have distinct flavors, textures, and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, they should be considered separate instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
