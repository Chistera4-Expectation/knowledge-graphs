text: No, Almond Oil and Macadamia Nut Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible vegetal oils derived from nuts,
  they have distinct chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, and uses. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each oil.
