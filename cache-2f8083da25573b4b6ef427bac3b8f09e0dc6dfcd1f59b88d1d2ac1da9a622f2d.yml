  While both "rice paper wrappers" and "white rice" contain the word "rice," they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Rice paper wrappers are thin sheets
  made from rice flour and water that are typically used for rolling and cooking Vietnamese-style
  spring rolls. White rice is a type of grain that belongs to the species Oryza sativa
  and can come in various forms such as long-grain, short-grain, or jasmine rice.
  They have different nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and cultural significance.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
