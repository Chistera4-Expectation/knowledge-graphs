  While both "chicken broth" and "chicken pot pie" are poultry-derived foods that
  contain chicken as an ingredient, they have different culinary uses and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Chicken broth is typically used as a base for soups and sauces, while
  chicken pot pie is a complete dish with various ingredients such as vegetables and
  crust. These differences warrant their separate classification within the Poultry-derived
  Food category.'
