text: No, 'Ostrich Gravy' and 'Ostrich Meat' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from ostriches, they are different
  types of poultry-derived food with distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles,
  and culinary uses. 'Ostrich Meat' refers to the flesh of the ostrich, while 'Ostrich
  Gravy' is a sauce typically made from the meat's drippings or stock, often combined
  with other ingredients.
