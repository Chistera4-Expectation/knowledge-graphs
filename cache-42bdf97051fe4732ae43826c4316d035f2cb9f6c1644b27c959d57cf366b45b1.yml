text: No, Ginger Tea and Oolong Tea should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates, as they are different types of tea with distinct properties
  and flavors. Ginger Tea is made by steeping ginger root in hot water, while Oolong
  Tea is a traditional Chinese tea made from the leaves, buds, and stems of the Camellia
  sinensis plant.
