text: ' No. While both "type of water being consumed" and "infused water" are types
  of water, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. The former is a more
  general category that includes all types of drinking water (e.g., tap water, bottled
  water, sparkling water), while the latter is a specific subcategory of drinking
  water that has been infused with flavors from fruits, herbs, or other ingredients.
  Therefore, it would be incorrect to merge these two instances.'
