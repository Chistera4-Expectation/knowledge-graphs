text: No, the instances 'Morel Mushroom' and 'Porcini Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible mushrooms,
  they belong to different species with distinct characteristics, flavors, and uses
  in cooking. Merging them would create confusion and misinformation about the properties
  and uses of each type of mushroom.
