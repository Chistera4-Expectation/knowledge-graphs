text: No, Apricot Kernel Oil and Hazelnut Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetal oils, they have
  distinct properties, compositions, and uses. Merging them would not accurately represent
  the unique characteristics of each oil.
