  While both Heather honey and Organic clover honey are types of honey, they have
  distinct characteristics that make them unique and not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Heather honey is made from nectar collected by bees from heather plants, typically
  with a strong flavor and dark color. On the other hand, organic clover honey comes
  from bees that pollinate clover flowers grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers,
  resulting in a milder taste and lighter color compared to heather honey. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates since they
  refer to different varieties of honey with specific properties and origins.'
