text: As a dietician, my focus is on the nutritional content and health aspects of
  food rather than the classification of food items. However, from a semantic and
  ontologic perspective, it could be reasonable to merge 'Tortillas' and 'flour tortillas'
  as they are essentially the same food item. 'Tortillas' typically refers to flour
  tortillas, while corn tortillas are sometimes referred to as just 'tortillas' to
  distinguish them from flour tortillas. However, the final decision depends on the
  specific context and classification system being used.
