text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from poultry, they have distinct differences in terms of nutritional
  content, taste, and cooking properties. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are leaner,
  higher in protein, and lower in fat compared to chicken thighs. Chicken thighs,
  on the other hand, have a higher fat content and are often more flavorful due to
  the presence of skin and dark meat.
