text: As a dietician, I would recommend not merging 'Herbal Tea' and 'Jasmine Tea'
  into a single class. Although both are types of tea, they have distinct characteristics
  and ingredients. Herbal teas are infusions made from various herbs, spices, and
  other plants, while Jasmine Tea is a green tea scented with jasmine flowers. Therefore,
  it is best to keep them separate in the class hierarchy.
