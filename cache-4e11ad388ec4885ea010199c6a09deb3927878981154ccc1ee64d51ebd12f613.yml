text: ' No. Jamaican Jerk Seasoning is a specific type of seasoning with its own unique
  ingredients and flavor profile, while "optional seasonings" refers to any additional
  seasonings that can be added according to personal preference. Therefore, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates and should remain separate.'
