text: No, 'Artisanal Water' and 'Spring Water' should not be merged as they are not
  semantic or ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of drinking water, they
  have distinct characteristics and origins. Artisanal water typically refers to water
  sourced from smaller, local, and often hand-crafted sources, while spring water
  is sourced from natural underground springs. Therefore, they are not the same and
  should be kept separate.
