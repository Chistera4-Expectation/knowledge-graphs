text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Duck Breast" and "Duck Soup"
  are poultry-derived food, they represent different dishes with distinct ingredients
  and preparation methods. "Duck Breast" refers to the cut of meat from a duck, while
  "Duck Soup" is a soup made with duck as the main ingredient. Merging them would
  create confusion and lose valuable information about each dish.
