text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of tea. Infused tea
  refers to tea that is steeped in hot water to extract its flavor and nutrients,
  while Lemon Tea is a specific type of tea that is infused with lemon flavor or ingredients.
  While both are types of tea, they have distinct characteristics that differentiate
  them from one another.
