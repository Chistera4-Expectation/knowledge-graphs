text: No, the instances 'Grass-fed Butter' and 'Whipped Butter' should not be merged
  together as they have different nutritional and processing characteristics. Grass-fed
  butter comes from cows that are fed primarily on grass, which can affect the nutritional
  composition, such as a higher level of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin K2. On the
  other hand, whipped butter is made by incorporating air into regular butter, making
  it lighter and easier to spread. Although they are both types of butter, they have
  distinct differences in their properties and should not be considered as duplicates.
