text: " No.\n\nRice bran oil and vegetable oil are different types of edible oils\
  \ with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Rice bran oil is extracted\
  \ from the bran of rice grains and has a higher smoke point than vegetable oil,\
  \ which makes it more suitable for high-heat cooking methods like frying. On the\
  \ other hand, vegetable oil is a blend of various plant-based oils and has a lower\
  \ smoke point, making it better suited for low-heat cooking methods like saut\xE9\
  ing and roasting. Additionally, rice bran oil has a nuttier flavor compared to vegetable\
  \ oil, which may affect its usage in certain recipes. Therefore, they should not\
  \ be considered semantic and ontological duplicates."
