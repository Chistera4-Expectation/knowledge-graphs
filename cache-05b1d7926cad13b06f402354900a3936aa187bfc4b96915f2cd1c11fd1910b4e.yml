  While soybean oil and palm oil may share some similarities as types of edible vegetable
  oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come from different
  plant sources (soybeans vs. palm fruit), have distinct nutritional profiles, and
  are used differently in various culinary applications. Therefore, it is essential
  to maintain them as separate instances within the edible vegetable oil classification
  system.'
