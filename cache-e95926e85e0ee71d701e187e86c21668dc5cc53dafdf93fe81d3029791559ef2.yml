text: ' No. While both instant oatmeal and regular oatmeal are made from oats, they
  differ in their nutritional content and preparation methods, so it is appropriate
  to keep them separate in a breakfast cereal classification system. Instant oatmeal
  often has added sugars and salt, making its nutrition profile different from that
  of unflavored, regular oatmeal. Additionally, because instant oatmeal cooks more
  quickly than regular oatmeal, this may affect how people consume and digest each
  product. Therefore, for accuracy in describing these items and providing useful
  information to consumers, I would recommend keeping "instant oatmeal" and "oatmeal"
  as distinct categories within your breakfast cereal class.'
