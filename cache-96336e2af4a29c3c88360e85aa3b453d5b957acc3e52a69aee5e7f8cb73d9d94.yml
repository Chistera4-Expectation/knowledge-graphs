text: ' No. While chicken is an ingredient in chicken Caesar salad, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they refer to different food items with distinct
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Merging them would result in loss of information
  about the specific dish (chicken Caesar salad) and its unique characteristics.'
