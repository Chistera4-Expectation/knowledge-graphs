text: No, Pork Shank and Salt Pork should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are derived from pork, they are different cuts and are
  prepared differently. Pork Shank is a cut of meat from the lower part of the front
  or hind leg of a pig, while Salt Pork is pork that has been cured in salt, typically
  used as a flavoring agent in cooking. They have distinct nutritional profiles and
  culinary applications, so they should not be considered as the same entity.
