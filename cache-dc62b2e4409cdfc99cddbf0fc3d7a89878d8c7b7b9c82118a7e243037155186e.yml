text: ' "Insectivore" would be the most adequate class for grasshoppers, as they primarily
  feed on plants and other insects. Honey is not an appropriate classification for
  grasshoppers as it is a food source rather than a type of animal or diet. An insectivore
  is an organism that mainly eats insects, which describes the feeding habits of grasshoppers
  quite accurately.'
