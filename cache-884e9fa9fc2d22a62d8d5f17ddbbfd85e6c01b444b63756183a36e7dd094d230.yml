text: No, 'Ceylon Tea' and 'White Tea' should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of tea. Ceylon Tea is a type of black tea originating from Sri Lanka, while
  White Tea refers to a specific processing method for tea leaves, resulting in a
  less oxidized and more delicate flavor profile. While both are types of tea, they
  have distinct characteristics and should not be considered semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
