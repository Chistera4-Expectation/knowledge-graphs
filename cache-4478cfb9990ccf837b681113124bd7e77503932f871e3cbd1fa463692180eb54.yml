  While black rice and idli rice may both fall under the general category of "rice,"
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct nutritional
  profiles, culinary uses, and cultural significance. Black rice is known for its
  high antioxidant content, while idli rice (parboiled rice) has been processed to
  reduce cooking time and improve digestibility. Merging them would result in loss
  of specific information about each type of rice.'
