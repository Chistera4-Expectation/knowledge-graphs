  While both are spices, they have distinct properties, flavors, and uses in cooking.
  Ground black pepper is made from whole black peppercorns, while red pepper flakes
  are typically made from dried and crushed red chili peppers. They have different
  levels of heat and flavor profiles, and are used differently in recipes.
