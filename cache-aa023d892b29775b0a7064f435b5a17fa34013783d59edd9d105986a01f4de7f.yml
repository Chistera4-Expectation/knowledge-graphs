text: No, Pork Cutlet and Pork Loin should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are different cuts of pork with distinct characteristics,
  preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. While they are both derived from
  pork, they are separate instances within the Pork-derived Food class.
