text: No, Red wine and Shaoxing wine should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates because they are two different types of alcoholic drinks with distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and uses in culinary and cultural contexts. Red wine is
  a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties, while Shaoxing wine is a
  Chinese rice wine made from fermented glutinous rice. They are not interchangeable,
  and their inclusion in the Alcoholic Drink class would serve to represent the variety
  of beverages within this category.
