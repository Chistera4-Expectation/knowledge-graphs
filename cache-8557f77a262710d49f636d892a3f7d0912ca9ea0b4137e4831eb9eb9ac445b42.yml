  Although both are derived from quail, they are different dishes with distinct ingredients,
  preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. Quail Soup typically contains broth,
  vegetables, and pieces of quail meat, while Quail Wings are a specific cut of the
  bird that are often cooked and served separately.
