text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are infusion drinks, they have
  different ingredients (Apple Clove Infusion has apple and clove, while Grapefruit
  Rose Infusion has grapefruit and rose) and therefore are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. They can exist as separate instances in the class.
