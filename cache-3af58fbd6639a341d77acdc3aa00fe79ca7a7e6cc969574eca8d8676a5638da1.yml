  While "cilantro" and "fresh cilantro leaves" may refer to the same ingredient (cilantro
  leaves), they serve different purposes in classification and description. Cilantro
  refers to the plant as a whole while fresh cilantro leaves specifically denote the
  leafy part of the herb that is used for culinary purposes. Merging them would not
  accurately reflect their distinct uses and definitions within the context of edible
  vegetables.'
