text: No, 'Sparkling Water' and 'Water' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of water, sparkling water contains added carbonation,
  which gives it a distinct taste and texture compared to regular water. Therefore,
  they are not semantically or ontologically equivalent.
