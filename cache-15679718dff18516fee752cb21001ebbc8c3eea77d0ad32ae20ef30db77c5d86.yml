text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from ducks, they are different food items with distinct nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses. Duck broth is a liquid food item made by simmering duck
  bones, meat, and/or vegetables, while duck gizzards are a specific part of the bird's
  digestive system that can be cooked and consumed.
