text: No, Pea Milk and Rice Milk should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they are both milk alternatives, they are derived from different
  sources (peas and rice, respectively) and have distinct nutritional profiles. Merging
  them would result in a loss of information and potentially lead to confusion when
  considering the dietary needs and preferences of individuals.
