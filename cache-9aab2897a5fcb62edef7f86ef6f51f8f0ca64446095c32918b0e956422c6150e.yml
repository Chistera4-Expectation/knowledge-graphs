  Chanterelle mushrooms (Cantharellus cibarius) and Enoki mushrooms (Flammulina velutipes)
  are two different species of mushrooms with distinct characteristics, flavors, and
  textures. They have different nutritional profiles and culinary uses, and therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
