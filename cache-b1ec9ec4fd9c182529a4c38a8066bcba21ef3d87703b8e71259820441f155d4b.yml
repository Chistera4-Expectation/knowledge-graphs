text: No, Basmati Rice and Forbidden Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics and
  properties that differentiate them. Basmati Rice is a long-grain rice from the Indian
  subcontinent, known for its aroma and nutty flavor, while Forbidden Rice (also known
  as Black Rice) is a short-grain, high-antioxidant rice from China. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the unique qualities of each type of rice.
