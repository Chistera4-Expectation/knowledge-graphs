text: "No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While\
  \ both are derived from ducks, they are distinct types of food products. Duck liver\
  \ refers to the liver of a duck, often used in p\xE2t\xE9 or foie gras, while duck\
  \ patties are ground duck meat formed into a patty shape, commonly used in burgers\
  \ or similar dishes. They have different nutritional profiles and culinary uses."
