text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both "Glacier Water" and "Spring-fed Water" are types of drinking water, they have
  distinct origins and characteristics. Glacier water comes from melting glaciers,
  while spring-fed water originates from underground springs. These differences can
  impact taste, mineral content, and other properties of the water.
