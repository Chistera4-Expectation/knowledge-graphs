  The two instances, "sliced tomatoes" and "bacon bits, diced vegetables," are not
  identical in their composition or nutritional content. Sliced tomatoes contain only
  tomatoes, whereas bacon bits, diced vegetables may include various vegetables (such
  as onions, bell peppers, mushrooms) along with bacon bits. Therefore, they cannot
  be considered semantic and ontological duplicates.'
