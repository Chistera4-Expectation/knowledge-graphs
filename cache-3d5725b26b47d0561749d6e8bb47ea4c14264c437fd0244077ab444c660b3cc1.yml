text: No, 'Fried Egg' and 'Hard-boiled Eggs' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both derived from eggs, they have different
  preparation methods and nutritional values. They belong to different subcategories
  within the Edible Vegetable class, and should be treated as separate instances.
