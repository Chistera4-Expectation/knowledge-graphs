text: No, Cow's Milk and Hemp Milk should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are types of milk, they have different nutritional profiles,
  come from different sources, and have different properties. Merging them together
  would not accurately represent the distinct characteristics of each milk type.
