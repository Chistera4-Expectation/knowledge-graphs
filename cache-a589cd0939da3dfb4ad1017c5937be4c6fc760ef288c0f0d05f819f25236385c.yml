  While both Jamaican Jerk Seasoning and Old Bay Seasoning are types of spice blends
  used for flavoring food, they have distinct ingredients and uses. Jamaican Jerk
  Seasoning typically includes allspice, thyme, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, garlic,
  onion, chilies, black pepper, and salt, while Old Bay Seasoning consists of celery
  salt, paprika, mustard seed, black pepper, white pepper, crushed red pepper flakes,
  bay leaves, cloves, allspice, ginger, mace, cardamom, and nutmeg. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
