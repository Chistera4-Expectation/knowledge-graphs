text: No, the instances 'Hard Water' and 'Soft Water' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of drinking water, they have
  distinct properties and characteristics. Hard water contains high levels of minerals
  such as calcium and magnesium, while soft water has lower mineral content. These
  differences in composition can impact the taste, feel, and performance of water
  in various applications, such as washing or cooking. Therefore, it is important
  to maintain separate categories for Hard Water and Soft Water in the Drinking Water
  class.
