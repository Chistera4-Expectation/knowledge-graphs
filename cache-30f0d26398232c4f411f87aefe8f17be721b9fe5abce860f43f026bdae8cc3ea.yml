  While both cayenne pepper and dried red pepper flakes may have similar spicy flavors
  due to their shared ingredient of capsaicin, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They differ in several ways:


  1. Origin: Cayenne pepper is a type of chili pepper that originated from South America
  (specifically Amazonian forests), while dried red pepper flakes can come from various
  types of peppers including those from Italy, China, or other regions.

  2. Form: Fresh cayenne peppers can be used whole, sliced, powdered, or dried; meanwhile,
  dried red pepper flakes typically refer to small pieces of crushed dried peppers
  with seeds still present.

  3. Heat level: The heat intensity might vary between specific batches of cayenne
  pepper or dried red pepper flakes depending on factors such as cultivation conditions
  and ripeness at harvesting time. However, generally speaking, cayenne pepper tends
  to be hotter than most blends of dried red pepper flakes available commercially.

  4. Flavor profile: Although both share some common notes, each has distinct undertones
  derived from their unique chemical compositions influenced by species variation,
  growing location, curing process, etc. For instance, cayenne pepper often exhibits
  more bright and fruity flavors compared to the earthier taste found in many varieties
  of dried red pepper flakes.


  Therefore, it would not be accurate to merge these two terms as semantic or ontological
  duplicates since they represent different culinary ingredients with varying characteristics.'
