text: ' No, eggplants and fresh cilantro are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They belong to different vegetable categories (i.e., fruit vs herb) and have distinct
  nutritional profiles, flavors, textures, and uses in cooking. Therefore, they should
  remain separate instances within the Edible Vegetable class.'
