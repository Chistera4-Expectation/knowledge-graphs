text: No, they should not be merged together. "Chicken Thighs" and "chicken/vegetable
  stock" are two distinct poultry-derived food items with different nutritional profiles
  and uses in cooking. "Chicken Thighs" is a specific cut of meat, while "chicken/vegetable
  stock" is a liquid preparation made by simmering chicken and vegetables. They should
  remain separate in the Poultry-derived Food class.
