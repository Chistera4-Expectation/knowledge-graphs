text: ' No. While both "Optional Protein" and "Protein" may seem similar, they have
  different meanings within the context of a beef class from a dietary perspective.


  * "Protein" generally refers to the macronutrient that is essential for building
  and repairing tissues in the body. It can be found in various foods, including beef.

  * "Optional Protein," on the other hand, implies that there are alternative sources
  of protein available besides beef. This term could be used to indicate flexibility
  in meal planning or to accommodate individuals with specific dietary preferences
  or restrictions.


  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two terms as they serve distinct
  purposes in communicating nutritional information about beef.'
