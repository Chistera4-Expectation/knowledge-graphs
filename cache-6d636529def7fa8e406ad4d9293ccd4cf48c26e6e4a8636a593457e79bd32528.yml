text: No, "Ostrich Meatballs" and "Ostrich Sausage" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from ostrich
  meat, they are different food items with distinct preparation methods and textures.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived food
  options available.
