text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct food items with
  different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Chicken Feet are a specific part
  of the chicken, often used in various cuisines for their collagen-rich texture and
  gelatinous quality. On the other hand, Chicken Gravy is a sauce made from the drippings
  and juices of cooked chicken, often thickened with flour or cornstarch, and used
  to add flavor and moisture to dishes. While both are derived from poultry, they
  serve different purposes and have unique nutritional compositions.
