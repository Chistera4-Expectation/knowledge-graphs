text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. Although green onions and onions are
  both part of the Allium family and have similar nutritional properties, they are
  not exactly the same. Green onions (also called scallions) have a milder flavor
  and are harvested at an earlier stage of growth, while onions (Allium cepa) are
  harvested at a more mature stage and have a stronger flavor. They have distinct
  culinary uses and appearances, so they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates.
