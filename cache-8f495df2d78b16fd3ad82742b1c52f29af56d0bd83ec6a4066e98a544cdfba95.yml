text: ' No. Linden honey and orange blossom honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They are different types of honey with distinct flavors, properties,
  and sources. While they may both fall under the broader category of "honey," they
  retain their unique identities and characteristics. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to keep them as separate instances in a knowledge graph or database.'
