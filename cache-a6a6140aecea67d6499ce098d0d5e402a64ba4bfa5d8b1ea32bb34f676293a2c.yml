text: ' No. While both "Milk" and "Other plant-based milks such as oat milk" are types
  of beverages that can be consumed, they have distinct nutritional profiles and come
  from different sources. Cow''s milk is an animal product that contains protein,
  calcium, vitamin D, and other essential nutrients, while plant-based milks like
  oat milk are made from plants and may contain varying levels of nutrients depending
  on how they are fortified. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two concepts as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
