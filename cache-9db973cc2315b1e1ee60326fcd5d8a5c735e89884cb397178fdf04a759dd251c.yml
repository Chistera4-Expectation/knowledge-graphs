text: No, 'Red bell pepper' and 'habanero pepper' should not be merged together as
  they are different types of peppers with distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles,
  and uses in recipes. While they are both part of the Edible Vegetable class, they
  have unique properties that warrant their separation in a classification system.
