text: ' No. While chicken and turkey are both types of poultry and have some similarities,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They are distinct types of birds
  with their own unique nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to keep them as separate instances in a classification system for poultry-derived
  foods.'
