  While both "Greek Yogurt Dressing" and "Wasabi Dressing" are types of salad dressings,
  they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They have different ingredients
  (with Greek yogurt being a key ingredient in one and wasabi in the other) and flavors,
  serving different purposes in terms of taste preferences and cuisine styles. Therefore,
  it is important to keep them separate for clear communication about food products.'
