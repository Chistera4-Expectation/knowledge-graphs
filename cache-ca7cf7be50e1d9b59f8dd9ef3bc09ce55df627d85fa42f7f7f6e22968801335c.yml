text: ' No. While "habanero pepper" and "habanERO peppERS" may have the same meaning
  (a type of chili pepper), they are not exact duplicates because they differ in their
  grammatical form (singular vs plural). Merging them could lead to confusion and
  incorrect usage. It is important for a dietitian to differentiate between singular
  and plural forms when discussing food items with clients.'
