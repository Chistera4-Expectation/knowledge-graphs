  While brown sugar and white (or granulated) sugar are both sweeteners and share
  many similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of their composition
  and production process that make them separate entities from an ontological perspective.
  Brown sugar contains molasses, which gives it its characteristic color and flavor,
  while white sugar has had the molasses removed. Therefore, I would not recommend
  merging these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
