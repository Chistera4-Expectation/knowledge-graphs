text: No, 'Chicken Broth' and 'Chicken Soup' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from chicken, they have
  different properties and uses. Chicken broth is a liquid made by simmering chicken
  bones, meat, and vegetables, while chicken soup is a dish made by combining the
  broth with additional ingredients such as vegetables, pasta, or rice. They have
  distinct nutritional profiles and are used differently in recipes.
