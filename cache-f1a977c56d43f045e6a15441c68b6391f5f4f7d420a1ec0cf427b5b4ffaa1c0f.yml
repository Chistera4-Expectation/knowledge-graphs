  While both raw fish and stockfish are types of edible fish, they refer to different
  preparations and uses of fish. Raw fish typically refers to fresh fish that is consumed
  without cooking, often as sushi or ceviche. Stockfish, on the other hand, is dried
  and salted fish that has been treated specifically for long-term storage and use
  as an ingredient in various dishes such as soups and stews. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as they have distinct meanings and
  applications within the context of food and nutrition.'
