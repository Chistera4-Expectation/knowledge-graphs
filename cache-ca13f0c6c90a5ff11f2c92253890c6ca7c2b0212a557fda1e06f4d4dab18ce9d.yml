text: No, Chili Powder and Turmeric Powder should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are different spices with distinct flavors, colors,
  and health benefits. Chili Powder is made from dried chili peppers, while Turmeric
  Powder is derived from the turmeric root. Although both are used for seasoning and
  have some similar applications, they are not interchangeable in terms of their culinary
  and nutritional properties.
