text: No, Curry Powder and Turmeric Powder should not be merged together as they have
  distinct compositions, flavors, and uses in cooking. While Turmeric Powder is a
  single spice made from ground turmeric root, Curry Powder is a blend of several
  spices, often including turmeric, but also other spices like coriander, cumin, and
  chili. They may have some similarities, but they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
