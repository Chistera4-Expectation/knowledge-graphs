  While both ground beef and pasture-raised beef are types of beef, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their production methods and nutritional profiles. Ground
  beef is made by grinding lean meat from various parts of the cow, while pasture-raised
  beef refers to cattle that are raised on open pastures where they can graze freely
  and eat natural grasses. These two concepts should not be merged as they represent
  different categories within the broader classification of beef products.'
