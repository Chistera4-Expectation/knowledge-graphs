text: As a dietician, I would not merge the instances 'Flour' and 'flour tortillas'
  as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are related to flour,
  they represent different food items. Flour is a general term for a powder made from
  grinding raw grains, while flour tortillas are a specific type of tortilla made
  from wheat flour. They have different nutritional values and uses in recipes.
