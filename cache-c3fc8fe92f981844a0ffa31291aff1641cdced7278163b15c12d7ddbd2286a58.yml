  While both chicken soup and low-sodium chicken broth are poultry-derived foods that
  share some similarities, they have distinct differences in their nutritional profiles
  and uses in cooking. Chicken soup typically contains additional ingredients like
  vegetables, pasta, or rice, while low-sodium chicken broth is primarily made of
  reduced chicken stock with lower sodium content. Therefore, it is appropriate to
  keep them separate due to these distinctions.'
