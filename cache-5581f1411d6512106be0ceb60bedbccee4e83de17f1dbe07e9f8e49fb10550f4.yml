  While baking powder and baking soda are often used interchangeably in cooking because
  they have similar functions (they release carbon dioxide gas when combined with
  moisture and heat), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different
  chemical compositions: baking powder is a mixture of sodium bicarbonate, cream of
  tartar (or another acidifying agent) and cornstarch; while baking soda is pure sodium
  bicarbonate. As a result, their properties, uses and effects can differ in certain
  recipes. Therefore, it would be incorrect to merge them as duplicates.'
