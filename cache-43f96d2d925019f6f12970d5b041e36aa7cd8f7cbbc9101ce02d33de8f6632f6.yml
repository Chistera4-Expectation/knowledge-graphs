  Fat-Free Yogurt refers to yogurt with little to no fat content, while Greek Yogurt
  refers to a specific type of yogurt that has a thicker, creamier texture due to
  the straining process it undergoes. Although both types of yogurt can be fat-free,
  they are different categories of yogurt products.
