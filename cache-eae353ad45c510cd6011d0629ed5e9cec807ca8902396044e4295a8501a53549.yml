text: 'No, Hydrogen Water and Infused Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of water with distinct properties
  and methods of preparation.


  Hydrogen Water is water that has been infused with extra hydrogen molecules, which
  can be achieved through various methods, such as electrolysis. This type of water
  is believed to have antioxidant properties and may offer potential health benefits.


  Infused Water, on the other hand, refers to water that has been flavored with fruits,
  vegetables, or herbs, such as cucumber, lemon, or mint. Infused Water is often consumed
  for its refreshing taste and potential health benefits, such as increased hydration
  and providing essential vitamins and minerals.


  While both types of water may have potential health benefits, they are different
  in composition and preparation method. Therefore, they should not be considered
  as semantic or ontologic duplicates.'
