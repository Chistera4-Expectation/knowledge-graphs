  While canola oil and safflower oil share some similarities as they are both vegetable
  oils commonly used in cooking, they have distinct differences in terms of their
  nutritional profiles and chemical properties. Canola oil is rich in monounsaturated
  fats and contains a significant amount of omega-3 fatty acids, making it heart-healthy
  and beneficial for reducing inflammation. Safflower oil, on the other hand, has
  a higher concentration of polyunsaturated fats and is often recommended for its
  high smoke point and light flavor. Therefore, merging them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates would not accurately reflect these differences and could lead to confusion
  regarding their unique characteristics and uses.'
