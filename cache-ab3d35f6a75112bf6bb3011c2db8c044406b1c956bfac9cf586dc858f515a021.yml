text: ' No. Although both "Calories per serving" and "Cholesterol per serving" provide
  information about nutrition content, they measure different aspects of health and
  are not duplicate concepts. Calories refer to the energy content of food, while
  cholesterol is a type of fat found in some foods that can impact heart health when
  consumed in excess. Keeping these attributes separate allows for more accurate tracking
  and analysis of nutritional data.'
