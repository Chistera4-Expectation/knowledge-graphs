text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Ostrich Tenders' and 'Ostrich'
  are derived from the same animal, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  'Ostrich Tenders' refers to a specific cut or preparation of ostrich meat, while
  'Ostrich' refers to the animal or the general category of meat from the animal.
  The two terms have different meanings and serve different purposes in the context
  of a dietician's work.
