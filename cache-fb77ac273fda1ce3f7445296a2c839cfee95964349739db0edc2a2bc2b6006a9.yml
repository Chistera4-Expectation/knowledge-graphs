  Baking powder and Maggi seasoning cubes are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They serve different purposes in cooking and have distinct ingredients. Baking powder
  is a chemical leavening agent used in baked goods to help them rise, while Maggi
  seasoning cubes are flavor enhancers containing salt, MSG, and various spices.'
