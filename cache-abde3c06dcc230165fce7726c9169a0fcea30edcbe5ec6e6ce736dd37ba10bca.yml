text: ' No. Parmesan cheese and Swiss cheese are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together as the same instance. While both cheeses
  are types of dairy products that fall under the category of "cheese," they have
  distinct characteristics, flavors, textures, origins, production methods, nutritional
  profiles, and uses in cooking and culinary applications. Therefore, it is essential
  to maintain them as separate instances representing different concepts within the
  domain of cheese.'
