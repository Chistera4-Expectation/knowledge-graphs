text: No, they should not be merged together. While both instances are related to
  water, they serve different purposes. Soft water is a type of water that has had
  its mineral content reduced, while water for egg wash is used in cooking to help
  breading or glazes adhere to food. Although they both involve water, they are distinct
  entities with unique applications.
