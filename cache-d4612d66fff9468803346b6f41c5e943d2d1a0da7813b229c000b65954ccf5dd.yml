text: No, Cultured Butter and Unsalted Butter should not be merged together as they
  have distinct characteristics. Cultured Butter is made from cream that has been
  cultured with bacteria, resulting in a tangy flavor, while Unsalted Butter is made
  from fresh cream and does not have added salt. These differences make them unique
  entities in terms of semantics and ontology.
