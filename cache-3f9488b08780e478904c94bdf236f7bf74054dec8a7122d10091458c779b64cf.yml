text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are derived from chicken, they have different forms and preparations. Boneless chicken
  refers to chicken without bones, which can include various cuts such as breast,
  thigh, or tenderloin, whereas chicken patties are specifically formed into patties,
  often made from ground chicken meat. These differences in form and preparation make
  them distinct entities in the Poultry-derived Food class.
