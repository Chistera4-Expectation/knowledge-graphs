text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they both fall under the category
  of "bread" and share some similarities, they have distinct uses and properties.
  Graham cracker crumbs are typically used as a crust or base for desserts, while
  pie crust is a specific type of dough used to make pies. Merging them would not
  accurately represent their unique characteristics and applications.
