text: No, "Duck Nuggets" and "Duck Thighs" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are derived from ducks, they are distinct
  food items with different preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Duck nuggets
  are typically breaded and fried, while duck thighs are a cut of meat that can be
  prepared in various ways (e.g., grilled, roasted, or stewed). Merging these two
  items would result in a loss of important information about each dish.
