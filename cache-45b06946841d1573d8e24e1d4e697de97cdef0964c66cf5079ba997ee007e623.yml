text: No, "Chicken Meatballs" and "Chicken Soup" should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both contain chicken as a main
  ingredient, they are different food items with distinct preparation methods and
  textures. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique properties in
  a food classification system.
