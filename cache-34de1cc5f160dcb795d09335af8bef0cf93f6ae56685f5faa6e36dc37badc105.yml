text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct types of rice with
  different properties and uses. Sticky rice has a higher amylopectin content, making
  it stickier when cooked, while white rice has a higher amylopectin and amylose content,
  making it fluffier. These differences in composition result in different culinary
  applications and nutritional profiles.
