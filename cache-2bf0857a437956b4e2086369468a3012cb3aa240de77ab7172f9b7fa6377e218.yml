text: ' No. Olive oil and sunflower oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils. They have
  different nutritional profiles, tastes, uses, and origins, making them distinct
  from each other. Therefore, it is important to maintain these distinctions for accurate
  information and decision-making related to nutrition and cooking.'
