text: ' No. Calcium content per serving and cholesterol per serving are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. They represent different nutritional aspects of cheese
  that are relevant to health and nutrition considerations. Merging them would result
  in loss of important information about each aspect. It is essential for a dietitian
  to provide separate values for calcium content and cholesterol content when discussing
  cheeses with clients due to their distinct roles in human health and potential impacts
  on various diets (e.g., low-cholesterol or dairy-rich).'
