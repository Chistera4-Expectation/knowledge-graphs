text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both are derived from poultry and are types of meat, "Quail Meat" and "Turkey Meatballs"
  are different food items with distinct nutritional profiles and preparation methods.
  Quail meat is the muscle tissue of the quail bird, while turkey meatballs are a
  dish made from ground turkey meat, often mixed with other ingredients like breadcrumbs,
  herbs, and spices, and formed into balls.
