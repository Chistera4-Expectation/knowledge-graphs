  Although both "Lactose-free Butter" and "Light Butter" are types of butter, they
  have distinct properties and differences. Lactose-free butter is specifically designed
  for individuals who are lactose intolerant, whereas light butter has a lower fat
  content compared to regular butter. These differences make them separate entities
  in terms of classification and categorization.
