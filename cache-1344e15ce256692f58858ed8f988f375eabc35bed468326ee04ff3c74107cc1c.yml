  Low Fat Milk and Sweetened Condensed Milk are two distinct dairy products with different
  nutritional profiles and uses. While they are both milk-based and have similar nutritional
  components such as protein, calcium, and vitamin D, they differ in fat content,
  added sugars, and overall health effects. Therefore, they should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
