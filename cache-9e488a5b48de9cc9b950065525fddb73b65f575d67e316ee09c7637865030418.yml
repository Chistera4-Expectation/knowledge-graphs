text: No, these two sauces should not be merged as they have distinct ingredients,
  flavors, and uses. Chili bean sauce is a spicy, savory sauce made from chili peppers,
  fermented soybeans, and other seasonings, while Chimichurri sauce is a tangy, herbaceous
  sauce made from parsley, garlic, olive oil, and vinegar, typically used for grilled
  meats.
