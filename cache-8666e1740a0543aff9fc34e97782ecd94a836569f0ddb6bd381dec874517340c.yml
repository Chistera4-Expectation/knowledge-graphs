text: ' No. While both pork ribs and pork tenderloin are derived from pigs and can
  be classified under the broader category of "pork," they differ significantly in
  terms of their cut, culinary uses, nutritional content, and other attributes. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Instead,
  they should be treated as separate entities within the Pork-derived Food class.'
