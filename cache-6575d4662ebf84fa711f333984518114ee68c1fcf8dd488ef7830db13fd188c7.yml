text: No, they should not be merged. Green and yellow bell peppers are different varieties
  of the same species (Capsicum annuum), but they have distinct appearances, tastes,
  and nutritional profiles. Merging them would disregard these differences and lead
  to inaccuracies in dietary recommendations and meal planning.
