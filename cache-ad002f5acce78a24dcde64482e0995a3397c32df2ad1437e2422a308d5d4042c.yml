text: No, Hermit Crab and King Crab should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They belong to different families and have different characteristics,
  habitats, and uses in human consumption. Hermit Crabs are decapod crustaceans belonging
  to the family Paguridae and are typically found in shallow, tropical waters. King
  Crabs, on the other hand, belong to the family Lithodidae and are found in colder,
  deep ocean waters.
