text: No, "Duck Drumsticks" and "Duck Nuggets" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are derived from ducks, they are different
  types of food products with distinct preparation methods and nutritional profiles.
  Duck drumsticks are whole leg portions, while nuggets are typically formed from
  ground duck meat and may include additional ingredients and processing methods.
