text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  "Chicken Meatballs" and "Chicken Sausage" are derived from chicken, they have different
  forms and preparation methods, which make them distinct food items. Merging them
  would not accurately reflect the differences in their culinary uses and nutritional
  content.
