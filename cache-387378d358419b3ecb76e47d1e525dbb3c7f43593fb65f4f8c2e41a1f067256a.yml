  While both "hot sauce" and "optional dipping sauce" may fall under the category
  of sauces, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different
  purposes and uses. Hot sauce is typically used to add heat and flavor to dishes,
  while an optional dipping sauce is usually served on the side for diners to dip
  their food into. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  together.'
