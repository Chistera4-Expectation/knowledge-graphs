text: No, Rice paper wrappers and Wonton wrappers should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they are both used for wrapping food,
  they are made from different ingredients and have different textures and culinary
  applications. Rice paper wrappers are typically made from rice and water, while
  Wonton wrappers are made from wheat flour and water.
