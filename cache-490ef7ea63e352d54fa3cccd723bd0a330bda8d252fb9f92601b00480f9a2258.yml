text: As a dietician, I would suggest that 'Flaxseed Bread' and 'Rye Bread' should
  not be merged as they are two distinct types of bread with different nutritional
  profiles and ingredients. While they may share some similarities as breads, they
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. So, my answer is no.
