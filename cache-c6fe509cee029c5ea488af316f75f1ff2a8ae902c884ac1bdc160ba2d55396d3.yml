  Extra virgin olive oil and pumpkin seed oil are both types of edible vegetable oils,
  but they have different nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses, so they should
  not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates. Extra virgin olive oil is
  high in monounsaturated fats and has a distinct flavor that makes it suitable for
  salad dressings and drizzling over foods, while pumpkin seed oil has a higher concentration
  of polyunsaturated fats and a strong, earthy flavor that works well in cooking and
  baking applications. Merging these two instances would overlook their unique properties
  and potential health benefits.'
