text: ' No. While "chopped onions" and "onions" are related, they are not exact duplicates
  because they refer to different stages of preparation. "Onions" refers to the raw
  vegetable in its whole form, while "chopped onions" refers to the same vegetable
  that has been cut into smaller pieces for cooking or consumption. Merging them would
  result in loss of this important distinction.'
