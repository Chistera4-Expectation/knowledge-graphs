text: No, the 'Chicken of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Enoki Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they are both edible mushrooms,
  they have distinct characteristics, appearances, and culinary uses. Merging them
  together would disregard these important differences.
