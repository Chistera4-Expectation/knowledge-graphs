  While both avocado dressing and Russian dressing may fall under the category of
  "food dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have
  different ingredients and flavor profiles. Avocado dressing is typically made with
  mashed avocados, lemon juice, garlic, and oil, while Russian dressing usually contains
  mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, and spices. Therefore, these two types of dressings
  should remain separate entities.'
