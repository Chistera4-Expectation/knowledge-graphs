text: ' No. Organic Clover Honey and Strawberry Honey are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They come
  from different floral sources (clover vs strawberries) which can affect their taste,
  color, and nutritional profile. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between
  them.'
