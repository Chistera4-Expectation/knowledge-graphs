text: As a dietician, I would advise against merging 'Black pepper' and 'White pepper'
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both come from the same plant,
  Piper nigrum, they have different flavor profiles and uses in cooking. Black pepper
  is more pungent and aromatic due to the presence of piperine, while white pepper
  is milder and earthier, with the piperine being removed during processing. Therefore,
  it is essential to maintain separate instances for both types of pepper.
