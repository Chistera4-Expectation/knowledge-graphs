  While both Achiote paste and Tamarind paste are used as flavorings and ingredients
  in cooking, they have distinct flavors, appearances, uses, and origins. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates because
  they refer to different food items with unique properties and roles in culinary
  applications.


  * Achiote paste (also known as annatto) has a mildly earthy, sweet, and peppery
  taste with a vibrant orange-red color, primarily derived from the seeds of the Bixa
  orellana tree. It is commonly used in Latin American, Caribbean, and Filipino cuisines
  for adding color and subtle flavor to dishes such as rice, stews, soups, and marinades.

  * Tamarind paste comes from the pulp of tamarind fruit, which belongs to the legume
  family. The paste possesses a tangy, sour, and slightly sweet taste due to its high
  content of tartaric acid, malic acid, and sugars. Its primary use is in Asian, Middle
  Eastern, and Mexican cuisines for providing depth and acidity to various dishes
  like curries, chutneys, sauces, and drinks.


  Given their dissimilarities, there is no reason to consider Achiote paste and Tamarind
  paste as duplicates in terms of either semantics or ontology.'
