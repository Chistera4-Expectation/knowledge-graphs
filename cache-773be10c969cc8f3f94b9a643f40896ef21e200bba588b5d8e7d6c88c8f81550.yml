text: ' No. Although both "Protein per serving" and "Trans fat per serving" provide
  information about nutritional content, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they measure different aspects of nutrition: one is beneficial (protein)
  while the other can have negative health consequences when consumed excessively
  (trans fat). Merging them would lose this important distinction.'
