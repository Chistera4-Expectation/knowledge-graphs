text: As a dietician, I would focus on the nutritional content and ingredients of
  the bread rather than their ontological categorization. However, since both Ciabatta
  Bread and Cuban Bread are types of bread, it may be useful to keep them as distinct
  instances in the Bread class. However, if they share the same nutritional properties
  and ingredients, they could be considered semantic duplicates. The decision ultimately
  depends on the purpose of the class and how the instances are being used.
