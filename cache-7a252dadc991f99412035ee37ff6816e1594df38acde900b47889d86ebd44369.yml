  Although "blackberry honey" and "raspberry honey" might sound similar and both are
  types of fruit honeys, they come from different plant sources (blackberries vs raspberries)
  and therefore have distinct flavors, properties, and nutritional profiles. Keeping
  them separate allows for more accurate labeling and information about their unique
  characteristics.'
