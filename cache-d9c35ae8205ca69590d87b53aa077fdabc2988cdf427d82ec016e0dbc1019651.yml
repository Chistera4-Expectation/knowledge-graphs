text: ' No. Honey Lime Dressing and Russian Dressing are two distinct types of salad
  dressings with different ingredients and flavors. While they may not share many
  similarities in terms of their specific compositions, merging them semantically
  and ontologically would incorrectly group two unrelated concepts under one umbrella
  term.'
