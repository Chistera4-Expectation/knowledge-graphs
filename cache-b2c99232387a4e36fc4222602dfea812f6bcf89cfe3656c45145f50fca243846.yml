  While both Blueberry Honey and Creamed Honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics that differentiate them from each other. Blueberry Honey is made
  by bees that gather nectar primarily from blueberry flowers, resulting in a unique
  flavor profile with fruity notes. On the other hand, Creamed Honey is regular honey
  that has been processed to create a smooth, spreadable texture through controlled
  crystallization. Therefore, these two classes represent different aspects of honey
  and cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
