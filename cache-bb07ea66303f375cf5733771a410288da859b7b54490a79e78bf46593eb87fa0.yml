text: No, they should not be merged together. While they are both derived from turkey
  and are part of the poultry food class, they represent different food items with
  distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Turkeys drumsticks are a specific
  cut of meat, while turkey gravy is a sauce made from the drippings of cooked turkey.
  They are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
