text: No, Assam Tea and Darjeeling Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both types of tea, they have distinct characteristics,
  growing regions, and flavor profiles that set them apart from one another. Assam
  Tea comes from the Assam region in India and is known for its strong, malty flavor,
  while Darjeeling Tea is grown in the Darjeeling region of India and is known for
  its delicate, floral flavor. Therefore, they should remain as separate instances
  within the Tea class.
