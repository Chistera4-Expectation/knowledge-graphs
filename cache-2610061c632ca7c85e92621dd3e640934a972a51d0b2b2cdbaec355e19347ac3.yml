text: No, Pork Cutlet and Roast Pork should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both come from pork, they are different dishes
  with distinct preparation methods and culinary uses. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the variety of pork-derived foods.
