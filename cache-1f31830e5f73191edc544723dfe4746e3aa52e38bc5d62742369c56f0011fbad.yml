  Although both Achiote paste and Miso paste are types of pastes used for seasoning
  food, they have different ingredients, flavors, uses, and cultural origins. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Achiote paste is made primarily from ground annatto seeds mixed with other spices
  such as garlic, oregano, cumin, and salt, while Miso paste consists mainly of fermented
  soybeans along with rice, barley, or other grains. The two pastes offer distinct
  flavors: Achiote has an earthy, slightly sweet, and peppery taste, whereas Miso
  provides rich umami notes due to its slow-fermentation process. They also serve
  various culinary purposes; Achiote paste is often utilized for coloring and flavoring
  dishes like stews, soups, and marinades, particularly in Mexican cuisine, while
  Miso paste plays a crucial role in Japanese cooking, including miso soup, sauces,
  dressings, and pickling vegetables.'
