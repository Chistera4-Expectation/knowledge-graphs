text: No, Pheasant Broth and Pheasant Meat should not be merged together as they are
  different types of poultry-derived food. Pheasant Broth refers to a liquid obtained
  from cooking pheasant meat and bones, while Pheasant Meat refers to the muscle tissue
  of the bird. Although they both come from the same animal, they serve different
  purposes and have different nutritional profiles.
