text: ' No. Although both "brand" and "roast" provide information about the coffee,
  they represent distinct concepts and do not overlap semantically or ontologically.
  A single coffee product can have multiple attributes such as its brand (e.g., Starbucks),
  type (e.g., espresso), roast (e.g., dark roasted), origin (e.g., Colombia), and
  many others. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate when describing
  the properties of an instance within the context of coffee.'
