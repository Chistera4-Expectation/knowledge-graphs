  While both 'Crab meat' and 'Rock Crab' are edible crustaceans, they are not the
  same thing. 'Crab meat' refers to the edible flesh found within various crab species,
  whereas 'Rock Crab' specifically refers to a crab species, also known as Cancer
  irroratus. The two terms are related, but not interchangeable.
