text: No, Alfalfa Honey and Manuka Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics, properties, and uses. Alfalfa Honey is a mild-flavored honey commonly
  used as a sweetener, while Manuka Honey has unique antibacterial properties and
  is often used for medicinal purposes. Maintaining these distinctions is important
  for accurate classification and information sharing.
