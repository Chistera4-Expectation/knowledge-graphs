text: ' No. Soy Sauce Dressing and Thousand Island Dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of dressings, they have distinct ingredients and
  flavors. Soy Sauce Dressing is typically made with soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, garlic,
  and ginger, while Thousand Island Dressing contains mayonnaise, ketchup, relish,
  Worcestershire sauce, and other seasonings. Therefore, they remain unique entities
  in the food domain.'
