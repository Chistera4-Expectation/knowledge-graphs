text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of yogurt with
  distinct characteristics. Bulgarian yogurt is a specific type of yogurt made with
  Lactobacillus bulgaricus, while "Yogurt" is a more general term that can encompass
  various types of yogurt, including Bulgarian yogurt. Merging them would lead to
  loss of information and specificity.
