text: No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of pasta with different
  characteristics and nutritional profiles. Fresh noodles are typically made from
  wheat flour, eggs, and water, while Shirataki noodles are made from the konjac yam
  and have a significantly lower calorie and carbohydrate content. Merging them as
  duplicates would not accurately represent the differences between the two types
  of pasta.
