  Although both are derived from quail, they have different culinary uses and nutritional
  compositions. Quail broth is a liquid derived from cooking quail, while quail sausage
  is a meat product made from ground quail meat mixed with seasonings and stuffed
  into a casing. They serve different purposes in cooking and have different nutritional
  profiles.
