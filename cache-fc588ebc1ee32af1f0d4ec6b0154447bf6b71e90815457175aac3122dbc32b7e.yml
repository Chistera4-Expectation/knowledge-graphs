text: No, they should not be merged. Fresh noodles and rice noodles are different
  types of pasta made from different ingredients, even though they share some similarities.
  Fresh noodles are typically made from wheat flour, while rice noodles are made from
  rice flour. Although both are considered types of pasta, they have distinct characteristics
  and are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
