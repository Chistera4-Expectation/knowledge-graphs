text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates because
  they have distinct properties and characteristics. Soft water typically has low
  mineral content, while tap water can come from various sources (such as groundwater
  or surface water) and can vary in mineral content and treatment processes. Therefore,
  they are not semantically or ontologically the same.
