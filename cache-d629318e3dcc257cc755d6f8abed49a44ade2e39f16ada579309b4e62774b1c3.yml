  While both ground pork and pork loin are derived from pigs and can therefore be
  classified under the same general category of "pork," they have distinct differences
  that make them non-duplicate entities. Ground pork is made up of finely chopped
  or minced pork meat, often used for dishes like meatballs, sausages, and stir-fries,
  while pork loin refers to a specific cut from the back of the pig, which tends to
  be leaner and more tender than other cuts. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
