text: As a dietician, I can provide input on the nutritional aspects of these spices,
  but the decision to merge instances as semantic and ontologic duplicates is a matter
  of classification and database management, which would be better addressed by a
  knowledge engineer or data scientist. However, I can say that while black peppercorns
  and dried Cameroon pepper (also known as 'African pepper') are both spices and may
  have some similarities, they have different flavors and are derived from different
  plants, so they are not exact duplicates in terms of culinary use.
