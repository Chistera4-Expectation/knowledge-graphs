  While both ''beef'' and ''lean beef'' refer to meat from cattle, they have different
  nutritional profiles. Regular beef can contain more fat and cholesterol compared
  to lean beef. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between them for dietary
  purposes. Merging these terms would not accurately reflect their differences and
  could lead to confusion when providing nutrition advice.'
