  While coconut oil and sunflower oil are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  properties and uses that make them non-duplicate entities in terms of semantics
  and ontology. Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, making it solid at room temperature,
  while sunflower oil has a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fats, which makes
  it liquid. They also differ in taste, aroma, smoke point, and nutritional content.
  Therefore, merging these two instances would not accurately represent their unique
  characteristics and applications.'
