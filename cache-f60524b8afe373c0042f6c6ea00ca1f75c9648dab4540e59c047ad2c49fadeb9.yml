text: ' No. Arborio rice and black rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. While both are types of rice, they have
  distinct characteristics and uses in cooking.


  Arborio rice is an Italian short-grain rice that is commonly used in risotto due
  to its high starch content and ability to absorb flavors well. It has a creamy texture
  when cooked and maintains a firm center.


  On the other hand, black rice, also known as forbidden rice, is a type of whole
  grain rice with a deep purple-black color. It is rich in antioxidants, fiber, and
  protein compared to other varieties of rice. Black rice has a nutty flavor and chewy
  texture, making it suitable for various dishes such as stir-fries, salads, and desserts.


  Therefore, despite being types of rice, Arborio rice and black rice serve different
  purposes in culinary applications and possess unique nutritional profiles, which
  warrant their separate identities.'
