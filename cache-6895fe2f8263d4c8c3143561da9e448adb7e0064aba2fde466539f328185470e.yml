text: ' No. Avocado Dressing and Thousand Island Dressing are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, as they have different ingredients, flavors, textures, and nutritional
  profiles. While both can be used to add taste and moisture to salads or other dishes,
  they belong to distinct categories of dressings with unique characteristics that
  cannot be merged meaningfully.'
