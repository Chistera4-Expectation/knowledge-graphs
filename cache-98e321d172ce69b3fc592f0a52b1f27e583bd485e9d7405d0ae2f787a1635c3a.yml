text: As a dietician, my focus would be on the nutritional and health aspects of these
  sauces rather than their classification. However, in terms of semantics and ontology,
  'Dark soy sauce' and 'Soy sauce' are not necessarily duplicates. Dark soy sauce
  is a variety of soy sauce that is typically aged longer, has a thicker consistency,
  and a darker color compared to regular soy sauce. Thus, they can be considered as
  distinct entities in the context of sauce classification.
