text: No, Apple juice and Cranberry juice should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are juices, they are distinct types of juice derived from
  different fruits, which impacts their nutritional content and taste. Merging them
  would lose this distinction and potentially lead to confusion or inaccurate dietary
  information.
