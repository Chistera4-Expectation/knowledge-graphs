text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both ostrich and turkey drumsticks
  are poultry-derived food, they are different types of meat with distinct nutritional
  profiles, flavors, and textures. Therefore, they should be kept as separate instances
  in the Poultry-derived Food class.
