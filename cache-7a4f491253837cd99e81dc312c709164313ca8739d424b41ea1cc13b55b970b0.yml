text: No, "Pork Belly" and "Pork Sausage" should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of pork-derived food, with different nutritional profiles and preparation
  methods. They may belong to the same broader category (pork-derived food), but they
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
