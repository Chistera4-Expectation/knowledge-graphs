text: As a dietician, I would say that while both boiling water and infused water
  involve heating or adding flavors to water, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  Boiling water is a method of purifying or softening water, while infused water typically
  refers to adding fruits, herbs, or other flavors to water for taste and potential
  health benefits. They can be considered related, but they serve different purposes
  and have distinct characteristics.
