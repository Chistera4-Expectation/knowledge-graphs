text: ' Based on the options you have provided, the most adequate class for "Roux"
  would be "Food Seasoning". Roux is a thickening agent made from flour and fat (such
  as butter), which is used to add thickness and flavor to sauces and soups. It does
  not fit neatly into any of the other categories you have listed, but it can be considered
  a type of food seasoning due to its role in enhancing the taste and texture of various
  dishes.'
