text: ' "Dairy" would be the most appropriate class for "Milk," as it is a common
  category that includes milk, butter, cheese, and yogurt. However, if you are looking
  for a more specific class within the dairy group, then "Unprocessed Dairy" could
  be used to describe milk since it undergoes less processing compared to other dairy
  products like cheese or butter.'
