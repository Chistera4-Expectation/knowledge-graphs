text: ' No. While red wine and white wine can both be classified as types of alcoholic
  drinks and share some similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of their
  color, taste, and the type of grapes used in their production. Therefore, it is
  appropriate to keep them as separate instances within the Alcoholic Drink class.'
