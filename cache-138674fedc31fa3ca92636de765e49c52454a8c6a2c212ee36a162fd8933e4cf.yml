  The two instances, "Peanut oil" and "Vegetable oil for frying," are not exact duplicates.
  Although they share some similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of
  their specific uses, nutritional content, and chemical composition. Therefore, it
  is appropriate to keep them separate rather than merging them into a single instance.'
