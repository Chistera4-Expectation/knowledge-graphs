  In the context of a dietary restriction, "gluten-free bread" and "naan bread" are
  not interchangeable or duplicate options. Gluten-free bread is made without gluten,
  which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, whereas naan bread typically
  contains gluten. Some people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity may avoid
  gluten-containing foods like naan bread, so it''s important to keep these options
  separate to accommodate different dietary needs.'
