text: As a dietician, I would recommend not merging the instances 'Vegetables' and
  'other vegetables for variation' as they serve different purposes. 'Vegetables'
  can be seen as a general category, while 'other vegetables for variation' refers
  to a subset of vegetables that can be used to add variety to a diet. While there
  may be some overlap in the specific vegetables included in each instance, they serve
  distinct functions in a dietary context.
