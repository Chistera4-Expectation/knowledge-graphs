text: No, Pheasant Meat and Pheasant Nuggets should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from pheasants, they represent different
  processed forms of the meat. Pheasant Meat typically refers to the raw, unprocessed
  meat, while Pheasant Nuggets are a specific processed product made from pheasant
  meat, such as breaded and fried pieces. These distinctions are important for dietary
  and nutritional information, as well as for allergen and ingredient labeling.
