text: No, Rice Bran Oil and Safflower Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct compositions,
  properties, and uses. Rice Bran Oil is high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated
  fats, with a unique combination of oryzanol, tocopherols, and tocotrienols, making
  it beneficial for heart health and skin care. Safflower Oil, on the other hand,
  has a high concentration of omega-6 fatty acids, making it useful for reducing bad
  cholesterol levels and promoting heart health. The differences in their chemical
  compositions and properties make them separate entities in the context of dietetics
  and nutrition.
