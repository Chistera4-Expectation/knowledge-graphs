text: As a dietician, I don't have the authority to determine the structure of a programming
  class. However, from a food perspective, breadcrumbs and focaccia bread are different
  food items. Breadcrumbs are typically made from dried bread and used as a topping
  or coating, while focaccia bread is a specific type of Italian flatbread. Therefore,
  they shouldn't be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. The decision to
  merge them within the Bread class would depend on the programming requirements and
  the desired functionality of the class.
