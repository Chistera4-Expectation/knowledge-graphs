text: No, Alkaline Water and Sparkling Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  characteristics and properties. Alkaline Water has a higher pH level and is believed
  to have potential health benefits, while Sparkling Water contains dissolved carbon
  dioxide, which creates carbonation and bubbles. They are different types of water
  and should be kept separate.
