text: No, although both chicken nuggets and chicken tenders are made from poultry,
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. They have distinct preparation methods
  and textures. Chicken nuggets are typically made from ground chicken and formed
  into small, bite-sized pieces, while chicken tenders are made from whole, long strips
  of chicken breast.
