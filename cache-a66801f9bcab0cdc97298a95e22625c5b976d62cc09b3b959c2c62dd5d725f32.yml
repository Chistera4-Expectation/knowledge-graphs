text: No, Quail Gravy and Quail Stock are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Although they both involve quail, they serve different purposes and have distinct
  compositions. Quail Gravy is a sauce made from quail meat and other ingredients,
  while Quail Stock is a liquid preparation made by simmering quail bones, meat, and
  aromatic vegetables to extract their flavors.
