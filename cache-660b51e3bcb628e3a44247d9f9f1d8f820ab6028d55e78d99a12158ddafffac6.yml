text: ' No. Although black rice and brown rice are both whole grain rices that have
  similar nutritional profiles, they have distinct differences in terms of their taste,
  texture, and cultural significance. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them as
  separate instances with unique properties and attributes in a rice classification
  system from a semantic and ontological perspective.'
