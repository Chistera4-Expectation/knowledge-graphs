text: No, "Artisanal Water" and "Infused Water" should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  differences. Artisanal water refers to water sourced from a specific location or
  method, often emphasizing its unique properties or purity. Infused water, on the
  other hand, is water that has been infused with flavors from fruits, herbs, or other
  natural ingredients. Although both are related to drinking water, they represent
  different types and approaches to consuming water.
