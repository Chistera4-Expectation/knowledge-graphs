text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. While both "Duck Meatballs" and "Duck"
  are poultry-derived food items, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Duck
  meatballs are a specific preparation of duck meat, whereas "Duck" refers to the
  entire animal, which can be prepared in various ways. Therefore, they should not
  be merged together as duplicates.
