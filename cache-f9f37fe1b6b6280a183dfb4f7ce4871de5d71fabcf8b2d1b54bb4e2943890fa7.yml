text: No, the instances 'Gluten-Free Bread' and 'Pumpernickel Bread' should not be
  merged together as they have different characteristics and properties. Gluten-free
  bread does not contain gluten, while pumpernickel bread does. These differences
  make them distinct instances within the Bread class.
