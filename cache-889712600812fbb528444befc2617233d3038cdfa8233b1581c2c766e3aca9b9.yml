text: ' No. Olive oil and walnut oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged together. While both oils come from plants and can be used
  for similar purposes (e.g., cooking), they have distinct chemical compositions,
  nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses that make them unique products with different
  properties. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate categories for these
  two types of edible vegetable oils.'
