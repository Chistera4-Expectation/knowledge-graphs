text: ' No. Thousand Island Dressing and Yogurt Dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. Though both are dressings, they have distinct ingredients and preparation
  methods. Thousand Island Dressing is typically made with mayonnaise, ketchup, relish,
  onion, and other ingredients, while Yogurt Dressing is made primarily from yogurt,
  often with additional herbs and spices.'
