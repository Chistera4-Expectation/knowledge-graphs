text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are edible crustaceans, Blue
  Crab (Callinectes sapidus) and Horseshoe Crab (Limulus polyphemus) are different
  species with distinct characteristics, habitats, and uses. Merging them together
  would not accurately represent the differences between the two species.
