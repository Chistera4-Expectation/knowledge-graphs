text: No, Porcini and Portobello mushrooms should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they both belong to the edible mushroom category,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, flavors, and uses in culinary
  applications. Porcini mushrooms are of the Boletus edulis species, while Portobello
  mushrooms are a mature form of the Agaricus bisporus species.
