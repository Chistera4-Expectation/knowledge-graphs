text: No, "Cottage cheese" and "Ricotta" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of cheese, they have distinct
  characteristics, production processes, and nutritional profiles. Keeping them separate
  allows for more accurate and specific dietary recommendations and information.
