  The terms "lactose-free milk" and "skim milk" refer to different types of milk with
  distinct characteristics. Lactose-free milk is milk that has had the lactose sugar
  removed, making it suitable for individuals who are lactose intolerant or have difficulty
  digesting lactose. Skim milk, on the other hand, is milk that has been filtered
  to remove the cream, resulting in a lower fat content. While both types of milk
  may share some similarities, they are not identical and should not be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
