text: No, 'Buffalo Milk' and 'Milk' should not be merged together as they are not
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Buffalo Milk is a specific type of milk, while
  'Milk' is a broader category that includes various types of milk from different
  animals. Although they are related, they are not the same and should be kept separate
  in a class hierarchy.
