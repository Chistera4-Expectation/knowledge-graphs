  While rice bran oil and safflower oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct characteristics and uses that make them unique from one another. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.


  Rice bran oil is extracted from the germ and inner husk of rice grains and has a
  mild flavor with a high smoke point, making it suitable for frying and high-heat
  cooking. It also contains antioxidants such as vitamin E, phytosterols, and squalenes,
  which may offer health benefits.


  On the other hand, safflower oil is obtained from the seeds of the safflower plant
  and has a light, neutral taste. It is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)
  and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-6 fatty acids, but low
  in saturated fat. Safflower oil is often used in salad dressings, sauces, marinades,
  and baking due to its delicate flavor and high smoke point.


  Given their different chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, extraction methods,
  flavors, and applications, rice bran oil and safflower oil should remain separate
  entities within the category of edible vegetable oils.'
