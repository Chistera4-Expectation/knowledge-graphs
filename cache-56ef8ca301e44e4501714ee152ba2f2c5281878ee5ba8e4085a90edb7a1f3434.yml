text: No, they should not be merged together. Bluefish and sushi-grade fish are two
  different types of fish with distinct characteristics. Bluefish is a specific type
  of fish, while sushi-grade fish refers to any type of fish that meets the safety
  and quality standards required for raw consumption in sushi dishes. Although both
  may be consumed as edible fish, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
