text: No, Clover Honey and Sunflower Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they are derived
  from different floral sources (clover and sunflower, respectively), which can affect
  their taste, aroma, and nutritional content. Merging them would result in a loss
  of specificity and information.
