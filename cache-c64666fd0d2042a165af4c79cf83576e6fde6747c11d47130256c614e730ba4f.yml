text: No, Greek Yogurt and Low-Fat Yogurt should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of yogurt, they have distinct properties. Greek
  yogurt is strained to remove much of the whey, resulting in a thicker, creamier
  texture and higher protein content. Low-fat yogurt, on the other hand, refers to
  the fat content of the yogurt, typically with less than 2% fat. These are two separate
  classifications that can apply to different types of yogurt, including Greek yogurt.
