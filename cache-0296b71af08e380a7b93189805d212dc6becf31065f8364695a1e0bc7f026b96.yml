text: No, Quail Meatballs and Quail Patties should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both derived from quail meat, they have
  distinct preparation methods and appearances. Meatballs are typically round, whereas
  patties are flat and usually shaped like a small hamburger. The ingredients and
  cooking methods may also differ, resulting in different flavors and textures.
