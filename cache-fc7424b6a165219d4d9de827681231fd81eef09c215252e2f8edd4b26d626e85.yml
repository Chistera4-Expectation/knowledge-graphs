text: ' No. While sesame seeds and sunflower seeds are both types of edible seeds,
  they have distinct nutritional profiles, appearances, tastes, and uses in cooking,
  so they should not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates. Merging them
  would result in loss of important distinctions between these two unique food items.'
