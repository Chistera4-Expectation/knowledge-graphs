text: No, "Fish" and "Stockfish" should not be merged together as they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates. While both are members of the Edible Fish class, they are
  different types of fish. "Fish" is a general term for various species that can be
  consumed as food, while "Stockfish" specifically refers to a particular method of
  preserving fish (usually cod) by drying it in the open air and wind.
