text: 'No, they should not be merged as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both are types of butter, they have distinct characteristics: grass-fed butter
  comes from cows fed on grass, and unsalted butter is butter without added salt.
  These differences make them separate entities in terms of classification and properties.'
