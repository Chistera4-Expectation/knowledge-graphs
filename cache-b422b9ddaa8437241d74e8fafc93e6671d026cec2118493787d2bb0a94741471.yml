  While blue cheese dressing and lemon herb dressing may share some common attributes
  (e.g., both are dressings), they have distinct ingredients that set them apart from
  one another. Blue cheese dressing is made with blue cheese, while lemon herb dressing
  contains lemon juice and various herbs. Therefore, these two instances represent
  different concepts and should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
