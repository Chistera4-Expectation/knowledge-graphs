text: No, they should not be merged. While both are sauces, they have distinct ingredients,
  flavors, and uses. Chili bean sauce typically consists of chilies, fermented beans,
  and spices, while enchilada sauce is a tomato-based sauce flavored with chilies
  and other spices. They serve different culinary purposes and are not semantic or
  ontologic duplicates.
