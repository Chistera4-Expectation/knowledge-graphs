text: ' No. Cream cheese and Parmesan cheese are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. They are two distinct types of cheese with different
  nutritional profiles, textures, flavors, uses, origins, and production methods.
  Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate in any classification system
  for cheeses.'
