text: No, the instances "Boiling water" and "Electrolyte Water" should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of water
  with distinct properties and uses. Boiling water is simply water that has been heated
  to its boiling point, while electrolyte water contains added electrolytes for hydration
  and sports performance.
