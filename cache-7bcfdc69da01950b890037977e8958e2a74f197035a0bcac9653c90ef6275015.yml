text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of poultry-derived
  food. Quail Gravy is a sauce made from quail meat and its juices, while Quail Wings
  are a specific part of the quail that is prepared and consumed as food. Although
  they are both derived from quails, they are distinct food items with different culinary
  uses.
