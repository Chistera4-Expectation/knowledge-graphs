text: No, they should not be merged together as they represent different food items
  derived from ostrich. 'Ostrich Drumsticks' are a type of meat, while 'Ostrich Gravy'
  is a sauce made from ostrich meat or other ingredients. They serve different purposes
  in a meal and are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
