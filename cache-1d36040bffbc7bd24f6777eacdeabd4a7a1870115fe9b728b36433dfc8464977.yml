text: No, Chicken Broth and Ostrich Broth should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are broths derived from poultry, they
  come from different species and may have distinct nutritional profiles, preparation
  methods, and flavors. Merging them would not accurately represent the distinctions
  between the two types of broth.
