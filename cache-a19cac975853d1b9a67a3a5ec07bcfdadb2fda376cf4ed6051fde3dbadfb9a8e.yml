text: No, Coriander leaves and other leafy greens should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are leafy greens, they are distinct
  types of greens with unique nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses in cooking.
  They should be treated as separate instances within the Edible Vegetable class.
