text: No, "Duck Stock" and "Pheasant Stock" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the category of Poultry-derived
  Food, they are different types of stocks made from different types of poultry, and
  therefore, they are not duplicates. They may share some similarities, but they have
  distinct properties and uses.
