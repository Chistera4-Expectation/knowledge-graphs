text: "As a dietician, I can provide input on the nutritional aspects of coffee. However,\
  \ merging instances in a class based on semantics and ontology is more related to\
  \ computer science and software design. I would recommend consulting a computer\
  \ scientist or software developer for a more accurate answer. \n\nThat being said,\
  \ 'Coffee' and 'Greek Coffee' can be considered related but not necessarily duplicates.\
  \ They are both types of coffee, but Greek Coffee may have specific ingredients\
  \ or preparation methods that differentiate it from regular coffee. This could justify\
  \ having separate instances in a class."
