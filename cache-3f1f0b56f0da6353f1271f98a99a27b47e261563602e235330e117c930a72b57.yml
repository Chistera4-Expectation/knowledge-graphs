text: No, Brown Rice and Parboiled Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they share some similarities (e.g., both are
  unpolished and have higher nutrient content compared to white rice), they are still
  distinct types of rice with differences in processing methods and nutritional profiles.
  Brown rice undergoes minimal processing, while parboiled rice is partially boiled
  in the husk before being dried, milled, and polished. These differences result in
  variations in taste, texture, and nutrient availability.
