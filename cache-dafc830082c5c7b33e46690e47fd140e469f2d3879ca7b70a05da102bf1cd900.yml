  While horseradish dressing and thousand island dressing may have some similarities,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different ingredients
  and flavors, so merging them would not accurately reflect their unique characteristics.
  Semantic duplicates refer to entities that share the same meaning, while ontological
  duplicates refer to entities that belong to the same category but with distinct
  attributes and properties. Therefore, it is important to keep these two dressings
  separate in order to maintain accurate information about each one.'
