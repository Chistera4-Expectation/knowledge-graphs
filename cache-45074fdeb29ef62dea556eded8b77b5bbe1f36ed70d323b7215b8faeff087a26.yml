text: ' No. Avocado oil and sesame oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils. They have
  different nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and chemical compositions, making
  them distinct from each other. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate
  when discussing or categorizing edible vegetable oils.'
