text: ' No. Dextrose and monk fruit extract are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  even though they are both used as sweeteners. They have different chemical structures,
  properties, and sources. Dextrose is a simple sugar derived from corn starch, while
  monk fruit extract is a high-potency sweetener obtained from the monk fruit. Merging
  them would result in loss of important distinctions between these two sweeteners.'
