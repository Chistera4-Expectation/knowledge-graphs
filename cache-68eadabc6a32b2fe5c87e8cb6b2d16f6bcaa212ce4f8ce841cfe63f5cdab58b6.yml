text: No, "Duck Meatballs" and "Duck Soup" should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are poultry-derived foods containing duck, they are different
  dishes with distinct preparation methods and ingredients. Duck Meatballs involve
  forming ground duck meat into balls, while Duck Soup is a soup made with duck as
  the primary ingredient. They should remain separate instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
