text: No, the instances 'Breadcrumbs' and 'French Bread' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the broader
  category of 'Bread', they represent distinct types of bread products with different
  properties, uses, and nutritional values. Maintaining separate instances allows
  for more accurate and specific information about each type of bread.
