text: ' ''Pork-derived Food'' or ''Processed Meat'' would be the most adequate class
  for hot dogs. Hot dogs are typically made from pork, beef, or poultry and often
  contain other ingredients such as preservatives, salt, and spices. The World Health
  Organization has classified processed meats like hot dogs as carcinogenic to humans,
  so they should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.'
