text: ' "Soup" would be the most adequate class for these options since it is a liquid
  food that can contain various ingredients, such as vegetables, meats, and grains.
  The other classes are all beverages, with the exception of honey which is a sweetener.
  While soups can have similarities to some of these beverages (e.g., both soup and
  tea can be made from plants), they are generally considered a separate category
  due to their nutritional content and purpose in meals.'
