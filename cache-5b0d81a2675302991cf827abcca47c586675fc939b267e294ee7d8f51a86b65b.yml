text: No, the instances 'C4 Energy' and 'XS Energy' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both energy drinks, they
  are produced by different companies and have distinct formulas, ingredients, and
  branding. Merging them would not accurately represent the individual products and
  their unique features.
