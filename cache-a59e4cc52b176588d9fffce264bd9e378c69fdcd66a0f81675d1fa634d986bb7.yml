text: As a dietician, my answer is no, the instances 'Onion' and 'Red onion' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both
  types of onions, they have distinct characteristics, such as color, flavor, and
  culinary uses. Therefore, it is beneficial to keep them separate in the Edible Vegetable
  class to provide more accurate information for those seeking dietary guidance.
