text: ' No. Fresh mozzarella cheese and Swiss cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, and they should not be merged together. Although both are types of cheese,
  they have distinct characteristics, flavors, textures, and uses in cooking that
  make them unique from one another. Therefore, it is important to keep these two
  instances separate for accurate classification and understanding.'
