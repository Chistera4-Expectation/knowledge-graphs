text: No, Quail Sausage and Quail should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates in the Poultry-derived Food class. Although both are derived from quail,
  they are different food items. Quail Sausage is a processed food made from ground
  quail meat, while Quail refers to the whole bird or its parts. They have distinct
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses, so they should be considered as separate
  entities in the Poultry-derived Food class.
