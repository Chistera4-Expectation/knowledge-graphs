text: No, Chicken Gizzards and Chicken Sausage should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both come from poultry, they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional profiles and preparation methods. Chicken
  Gizzards are a muscle found in the digestive tract of a chicken, while Chicken Sausage
  is made from ground chicken meat mixed with various spices and seasonings.
