text: No, 'Soft Water' and 'Well Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of drinking water, they have
  different properties and sources. Soft water typically has lower mineral content,
  while well water can vary in mineral content depending on the specific well and
  location. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between the
  two types of water.
