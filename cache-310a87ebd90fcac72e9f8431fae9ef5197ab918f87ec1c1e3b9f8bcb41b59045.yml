text: As a dietician, I would say that 'Distilled Water' and 'Oxygenated Water' should
  not be merged as they have different properties and methods of preparation. Distilled
  water is water that has been boiled and then condensed back into liquid form, leaving
  most impurities behind. Oxygenated water, on the other hand, is water that has been
  infused with oxygen, often through the use of special equipment or processes. While
  both are types of water, they are not the same and have different characteristics
  and uses.
