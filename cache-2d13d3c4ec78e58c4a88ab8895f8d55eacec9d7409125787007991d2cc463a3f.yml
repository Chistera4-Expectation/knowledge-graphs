text: No, 'Milk' and 'Pea Milk' should not be merged together as they are not semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of milk, they have different sources
  (animal-based and plant-based, respectively) and compositions. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the distinct properties and characteristics of each type
  of milk.
