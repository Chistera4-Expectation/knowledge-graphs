text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Coriander seeds and Coriander
  refer to the same plant species (Coriandrum sativum), they represent different parts
  of the plant with distinct culinary uses and nutritional profiles. Coriander seeds
  are the dried fruit of the plant, while Coriander refers to the fresh leaves and
  stems. They have different flavors and are often used in different culinary applications.
  Therefore, it is essential to keep them as separate instances in a spice class.
