text: ' No. Parmesan cheese and serving size of cheese are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While "Parmesan cheese" is a specific type of cheese, "serving size
  of cheese" refers to the quantity of any type of cheese being consumed, including
  Parmesan cheese. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  together.'
