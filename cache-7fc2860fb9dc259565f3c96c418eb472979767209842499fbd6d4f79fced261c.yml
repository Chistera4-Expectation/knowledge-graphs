  While hemp seeds and watermelon seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  different nutritional profiles and characteristics. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates. It is important to maintain
  distinct categories for each type of seed to accurately represent their unique properties
  and uses in a dietary context.'
