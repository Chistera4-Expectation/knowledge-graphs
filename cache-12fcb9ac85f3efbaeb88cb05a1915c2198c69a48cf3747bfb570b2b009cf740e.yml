text: No, 'Ceylon Tea' and 'Earl Grey Tea' should not be merged together as they are
  two different types of tea. Ceylon tea refers to tea produced in Sri Lanka, while
  Earl Grey tea is a blend of black tea and bergamot oil. Although both are types
  of tea, they have distinct characteristics and should not be considered as duplicates.
