text: ' "Insectivore" would be the most appropriate class for a locust, as they primarily
  feed on plants and other insects. Honey is not an adequate food source for them
  as it does not provide the necessary nutrients that they need to survive. It is
  important to note that feeding wild animals or insects in captivity should always
  be done with caution and under the guidance of a professional, as providing improper
  nutrition can lead to serious health issues.'
