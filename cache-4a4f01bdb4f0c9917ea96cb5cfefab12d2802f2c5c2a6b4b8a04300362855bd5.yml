  From a semantic perspective, "Scotch bonnet pepper" and "Scotch bonnet peppers"
  refer to the same thing: a type of chili pepper that is commonly used in cooking.
  The singular form ("Scotch bonnet pepper") and plural form ("Scotch bonnet peppers")
  are simply different grammatical constructs for referring to the same object.


  From an ontological perspective, merging these two instances would not result in
  any loss of information or meaning. Both terms describe the same physical entity,
  so it makes sense to treat them as equivalent within a knowledge graph or database.
  Merging them would help ensure consistency and reduce redundancy in the data representation.'
