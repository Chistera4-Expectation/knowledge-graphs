text: No, the instances 'Blewit Mushroom' and 'Shiitake Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms,
  they have different characteristics, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Merging
  them would result in a loss of valuable information and distort the classification
  of these mushrooms.
