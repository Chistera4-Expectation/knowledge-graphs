text: ' No. While both "Calories per serving" and "Total fat per serving" provide
  information about the nutritional content of cheese, they measure different aspects
  of it. Calories give an overall measure of energy provided by the food, while total
  fat specifically refers to the grams of fat contained in one serving. Therefore,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.'
