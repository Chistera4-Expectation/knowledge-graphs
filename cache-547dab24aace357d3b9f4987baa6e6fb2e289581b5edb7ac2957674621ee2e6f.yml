text: No, 'Chicken Sausage' and 'Chicken Wings' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from poultry, they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional compositions and preparation methods. Chicken
  sausage is a processed meat, often made with ground chicken, spices, and fillers,
  while chicken wings are a specific cut of the chicken with varying cooking styles
  (e.g., fried, grilled, or baked).
