  While Black Vinegar and Chinkiang Vinegar are both types of dark, aged vinegars
  with a similar appearance and flavor profile, they have different origins and are
  used in distinct culinary traditions. Black Vinegar is a general term that refers
  to various types of dark vinegars produced worldwide, while Chinkiang Vinegar is
  a specific type of black vinegar originating from China''s Zhenjiang region. Merging
  them would not accurately represent their unique identities and uses in cooking.'
