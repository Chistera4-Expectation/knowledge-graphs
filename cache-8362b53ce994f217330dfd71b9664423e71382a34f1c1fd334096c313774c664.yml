text: ' "Beverage" could be a suitable class to categorize all three options: Coffee,
  Infusion Drink, and Tea. This is because they are all drinkable liquid consumables
  that can be part of someone''s daily diet. However, if you want to differentiate
  between caffeinated and non-caffeinated drinks, you may consider using "Caffeinated
  Beverage" as the superclass for Coffee and Tea, while keeping "Infusion Drink" separate
  since it typically does not contain caffeine.'
