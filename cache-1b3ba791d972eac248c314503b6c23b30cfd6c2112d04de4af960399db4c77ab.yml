text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  instances are derived from pheasant, they represent different forms of poultry-derived
  food. 'Pheasant Nuggets' refers to a specific preparation or form of pheasant meat,
  while 'Pheasant' refers to the general classification of the bird itself.
