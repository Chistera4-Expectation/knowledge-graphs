text: No, Camel Milk and Flaxseed Milk should not be merged together as they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. They are distinct types of milk with different
  nutritional profiles, sources, and properties. Camel Milk comes from camels, while
  Flaxseed Milk is plant-based and made from flaxseeds.
