text: No, they should not be merged as they are two distinct types of yogurt with
  different flavors and uses. Greek yogurt typically refers to a thicker yogurt with
  a tangy flavor, often used in savory dishes or as a protein-rich snack, while Savory
  Yogurt may refer to yogurt with added herbs, spices, or other savory ingredients,
  creating a unique flavor profile.
