text: No, Blue Cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of cheese,
  they have distinct characteristics, flavors, textures, and production methods. Merging
  them would result in a loss of specific information about each type of cheese.
