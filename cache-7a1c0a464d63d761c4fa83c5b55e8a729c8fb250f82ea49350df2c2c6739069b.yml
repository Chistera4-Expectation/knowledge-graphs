text: ' No. Sashimi-grade fish and stock fish are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. They refer to different types of fish that have undergone
  different processes and are used for different culinary purposes. Sashimi-grade
  fish is high quality raw fish intended for eating raw, while stock fish is dried
  fish typically used as an ingredient in soups and stews.'
