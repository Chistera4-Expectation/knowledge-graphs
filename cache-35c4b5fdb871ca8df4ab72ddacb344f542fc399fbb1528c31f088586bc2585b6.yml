text: ' No. While both curry leaves and other leafy greens can be classified under
  the broader category of edible vegetables, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Curry leaves refer to the aromatic leaves from the curry tree used primarily
  in Indian cuisine for their distinct flavor and fragrance. On the other hand, "other
  leafy greens" is a general term that encompasses various plants with edible leaves
  such as spinach, kale, collard greens, etc., which have different flavors, textures,
  and nutrient profiles than curry leaves. Therefore, these two concepts serve unique
  functions within the domain of edible vegetables and should not be merged as duplicates.'
