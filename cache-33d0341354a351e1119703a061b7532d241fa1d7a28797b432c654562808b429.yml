text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct properties and uses. Rice bran oil
  is known for its high smoke point and mild flavor, while sesame oil is prized for
  its nutty aroma and distinct flavor profile. They serve different purposes in cooking
  and culinary applications.
