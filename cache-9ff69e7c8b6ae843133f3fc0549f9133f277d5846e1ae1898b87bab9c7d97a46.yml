text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of honey, they have distinct
  flavor profiles and botanical origins. Orange Blossom Honey is derived from the
  nectar of orange blossoms, while Sage Honey comes from the nectar of sage flowers.
  Merging them would disregard these differences and the unique properties of each
  honey variety.
