text: ' No. Cholesterol per serving and Fiber per serving provide different nutritional
  information and cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates. Cholesterol
  is a fat-like substance that your body needs but can also be found in certain foods,
  while fiber is a type of carbohydrate that helps with digestion and regularity.
  Therefore, it is important to keep track of both cholesterol and fiber intake for
  maintaining good health, and they serve distinct purposes in providing nutritional
  information about cheese or any other food item.'
