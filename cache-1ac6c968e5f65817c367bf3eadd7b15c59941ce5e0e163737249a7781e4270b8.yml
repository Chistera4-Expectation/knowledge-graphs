  While both French dressing and Sesame Ginger dressing can be categorized under the
  broader concept of "salad dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and cultural origins. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate within the Food Dressing class.'
