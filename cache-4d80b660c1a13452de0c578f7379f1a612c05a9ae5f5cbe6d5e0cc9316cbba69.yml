text: No, "Chicken Gravy" and "Pheasant Gravy" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they both fall under the Poultry-derived Food
  class, they are different types of gravy made from different poultry sources, which
  can have distinct nutritional profiles and flavor characteristics.
