text: " No. While both bread and cornbread are types of baked goods that can be part\
  \ of a person\u2019s diet, they have distinct ingredients, nutritional profiles,\
  \ and cultural significance. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them\
  \ as semantic and ontological duplicates. It is important to maintain the distinction\
  \ between different types of foods in order to provide accurate nutrition information\
  \ and recommendations."
