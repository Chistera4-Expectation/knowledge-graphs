text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  "Key lime juice" and "Lime juice" are derived from the same fruit, they have different
  flavor profiles due to the unique properties of Key limes. Key limes are smaller,
  seedier, and more aromatic than regular limes, resulting in a distinct flavor that
  sets Key lime juice apart from regular lime juice. Therefore, it is important to
  differentiate between the two in a dietary context.
