text: No, Herbal Tea and Mint Tea should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of tea, they have distinct characteristics
  and flavors. Herbal tea refers to a beverage made from the infusion of various herbs,
  spices, or other plant materials, while Mint Tea specifically refers to a tea made
  from the mint plant. They are not semantically or ontologically the same.
