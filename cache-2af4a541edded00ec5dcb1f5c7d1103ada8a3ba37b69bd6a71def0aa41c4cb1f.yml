text: ' No. Pecorino Romano cheese and Swiss cheese are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged. They are two distinct types of cheeses with
  different taste, texture, production methods, and geographical origins. Pecorino
  Romano is an Italian sheep milk cheese with a sharp, salty flavor, while Swiss cheese
  is a cow milk cheese originating from Switzerland, known for its distinctive holes
  and mild, nutty flavor.'
