text: No, Beech Mushroom (Hypsizygus ulmarius) and Maitake Mushroom (Grifola frondosa)
  should not be merged together as they are two distinct species of edible mushrooms
  with different characteristics, appearances, and nutritional profiles. While they
  both belong to the class Edible Mushrooms, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates.
