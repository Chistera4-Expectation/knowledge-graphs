  While black beans and black-eyed peas are both types of legumes that can be used
  in similar ways in cooking (e.g., in soups, stews, salads), they belong to different
  botanical species and have distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to keep them separate as individual instances within the Edible Vegetable class.'
