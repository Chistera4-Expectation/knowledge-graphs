text: No, the instances 'Duck Sausage' and 'Duck Thighs' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from ducks, they represent
  different parts of the animal and are typically prepared and consumed differently.
  'Duck Sausage' is a processed product made from ground duck meat, while 'Duck Thighs'
  are a specific cut of meat from the duck's leg. They have distinct nutritional profiles
  and culinary uses, so they should be considered separate instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
