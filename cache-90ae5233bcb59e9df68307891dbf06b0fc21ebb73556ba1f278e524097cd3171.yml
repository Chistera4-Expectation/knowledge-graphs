text: ' No. While both "Coconut oil" and "Vegetable oil for frying" are edible vegetal
  oils, they have distinct properties and uses. Coconut oil is derived from coconuts,
  while vegetable oil for frying may come from various sources such as soybean, canola,
  or sunflower seeds. Their fatty acid compositions and smoke points also differ.
  Therefore, these two instances should not be considered semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
