text: No, Japonica Rice and Jasmine Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of rice, they have distinct
  characteristics, culinary uses, and origins. Japonica Rice is a short-grain rice
  commonly found in Japan and Korea, while Jasmine Rice is a long-grain rice originating
  from Southeast Asia, with a distinct fragrance and texture. These differences warrant
  separate classifications in a rice classification system.
