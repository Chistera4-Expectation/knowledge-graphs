text: ' I cannot provide an answer to your question as there is no known nutritional
  classification or category called "Buffalo Worms" in the context of nutrition. However,
  if you meant to ask about edible insects such as buffalo worms (also known as black
  soldier fly larvae), they are often categorized as a source of protein-rich animal
  food and can be considered part of the broader group of "edible insects." Honey,
  on the other hand, is a sweet substance produced by bees from nectar and pollen.
  It does not have a direct relationship with Buffalo Worms in terms of nutritional
  classes.'
