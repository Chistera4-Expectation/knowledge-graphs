text: No, Shaoxing wine and White wine should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of alcoholic drinks with different
  flavors, alcohol content, and cultural significance. Shaoxing wine is a traditional
  Chinese rice wine, while White wine refers to a broad category of light-colored
  wines made from various grape varieties. Although they both fall under the Alcoholic
  Drink class, they have unique characteristics that differentiate them from one another.
