  While both almond milk and traditional dairy milk can undergo pasteurization, they
  are not semantically equivalent nor do they occupy the same ontological category.
  Almond milk is a plant-based beverage made from ground almonds, while dairy milk
  comes from animals such as cows, goats, or sheep. The pasteurization method used
  for each type of milk may be similar, but it does not make them identical. Therefore,
  these two concepts should remain separate when discussing milk classification.'
