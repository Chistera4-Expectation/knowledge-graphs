text: No, Blueberry and Raspberry should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although they both belong to the Edible Fruit class, they are distinct fruits with
  different characteristics, such as taste, appearance, and nutritional content. Merging
  them would not accurately reflect the real-world distinctions between these fruits.
