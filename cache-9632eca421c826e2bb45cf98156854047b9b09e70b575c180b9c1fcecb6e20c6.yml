text: ' No. Although alfalfa honey and sage honey are both types of honey, they have
  different properties and characteristics that make them unique. Alfalfa honey is
  typically light in color with a mild flavor, while sage honey tends to be darker
  in color with a stronger flavor. Additionally, these two honeys may have different
  nutritional profiles due to variations in the nectar sources from which they are
  produced. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge alfalfa honey and sage
  honey into a single category as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
