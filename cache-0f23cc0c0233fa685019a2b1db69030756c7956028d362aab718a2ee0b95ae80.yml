text: 'Yes, it would be appropriate to merge the instances ''Optional: Marsala wine''
  and ''Wine'' as they are both types of alcoholic drinks and can be considered semantic
  and ontological duplicates. However, the specific context and application may also
  play a role in determining whether they should be merged or kept separate.'
