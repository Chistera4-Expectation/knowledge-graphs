  However, from a nutritional perspective, Breadcrumbs and Cornbread are different
  types of bread with distinct ingredients and nutritional values. Therefore, they
  should not be merged together as duplicates. They can both be classified as types
  of bread, but they have unique characteristics and should be treated as separate
  instances.
