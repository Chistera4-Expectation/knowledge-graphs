text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are "tenders" and are
  derived from poultry, they are distinct types of meat from different species. Chicken
  tenders come from chicken, while guinea fowl tenders come from guinea fowl. They
  have different nutritional profiles and flavor characteristics, so they should be
  treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
