text: No, Alkaline Water and Coconut Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They have different properties, compositions, and uses.
  Alkaline Water is water with a higher pH level, while Coconut Water is the clear
  liquid found inside young green coconuts, rich in electrolytes and minerals. While
  both are types of water, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.
