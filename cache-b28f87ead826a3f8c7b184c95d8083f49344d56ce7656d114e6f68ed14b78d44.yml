  While both "Comb Honey" and "Strawberry Honey" are types of honey, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. Comb Honey refers to honey that still contains
  the original beeswax comb, while Strawberry Honey is a type of honey produced by
  bees that gather nectar from strawberries. They represent different forms and sources
  of honey, and therefore should not be merged.'
