  While rotisserie chicken and turkey are both poultry-derived foods and have similar
  nutritional profiles, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They represent
  distinct food items with unique characteristics, even if those differences may sometimes
  seem subtle. For example, turkey is generally leaner than chicken and has a slightly
  different taste and texture. Additionally, "turkey" in this context refers to a
  broad category of birds and their meat, which can take on various forms (e.g., ground
  turkey, turkey breast), whereas "rotisserie chicken" specifically describes how
  chicken has been prepared. Therefore, it is appropriate to maintain these entries
  separate from one another.'
