text: ' No. Olive oil and sesame oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates even
  though they fall under the same category of edible vegetable oils. They have different
  nutritional profiles, flavors, uses, and origins, making them distinct from each
  other. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate.'
