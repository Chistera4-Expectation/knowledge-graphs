text: No, the instances 'Ghost Shrimp' and 'Unsweetened shrimp flakes' should not
  be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Ghost Shrimp (Palaemonetes spp.)
  are a type of small, edible shrimp, while unsweetened shrimp flakes are a processed
  food product made from dried and ground shrimp. Although they are both related to
  edible crustaceans, they are distinct entities with different characteristics and
  uses.
