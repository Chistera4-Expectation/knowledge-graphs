  The two teas have different ingredients and origins, making them distinct entities
  in the tea ontology. Berry Bliss Tea is a fruit-based tea containing a blend of
  berries, while Yerba Mate Tea is made from the leaves of the South American holly
  tree (Ilex paraguariensis). Their differences in taste, preparation methods, and
  cultural associations also set them apart. Therefore, they shouldn''t be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
