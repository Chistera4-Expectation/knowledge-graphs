text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are derived from chicken, they have different preparation methods and nutritional
  compositions. Chicken breast is a lean, boneless cut of meat, while chicken meatballs
  are typically made from ground chicken mixed with various seasonings and binders,
  and may include additional ingredients like breadcrumbs or cheese. As a result,
  they have different nutritional profiles, which makes them distinct within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
