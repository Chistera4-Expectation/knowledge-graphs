text: ' "Seafood" would be the most appropriate class for fish, as it is a category
  that specifically includes fish and other marine life used as food. The classes
  you provided - ''Beef'', ''Meat'', ''Pork-derived Food'', ''Poultry-derived Food''
  - are more specific types of meat from land animals. Seafood can also include shellfish
  like shrimp, lobster, and mussels, in addition to finned fish such as salmon or
  tuna.'
