text: No, Acacia Honey and Raspberry Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of honey, each with distinct
  flavors and properties. Acacia Honey is derived from the nectar of the Acacia flower,
  while Raspberry Honey comes from the nectar of Raspberry flowers. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each type of honey.
