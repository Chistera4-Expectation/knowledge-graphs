  The most adequate class for "Beef" among "Beef," "Pork-derived Food," and "Poultry-derived
  Food" is "Beef."


  Beef is a specific type of meat from cattle, while "Pork-derived Food" and "Poultry-derived
  Food" are broader categories that include various meats from pigs and poultry, respectively.
  Therefore, "Beef" is the most adequate class for "Beef" as it is a more specific
  subcategory within the category of "Meat."'
