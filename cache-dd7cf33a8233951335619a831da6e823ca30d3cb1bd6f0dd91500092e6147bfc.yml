text: No, Cremini mushrooms and Shiitake mushrooms should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of edible mushrooms, they have
  distinct characteristics, such as appearance, taste, and nutritional content. Therefore,
  they should remain as separate instances within the Edible Mushrooms class.
