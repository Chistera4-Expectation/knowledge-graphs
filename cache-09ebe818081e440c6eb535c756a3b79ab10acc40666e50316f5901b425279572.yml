  From a semantic perspective, "dried red pepper flakes" and "red pepper flakes" can
  generally be considered to refer to the same thing: dried and crushed red chili
  peppers. Therefore, they could be considered synonymous terms and merging them would
  not result in loss of meaning.


  From an ontological perspective, both concepts fall under the category of spices
  made from dried and ground chili peppers, making them similar enough that they could
  be combined into a single concept without significant impact on the overall organization
  or structure of the classification system for spices.'
