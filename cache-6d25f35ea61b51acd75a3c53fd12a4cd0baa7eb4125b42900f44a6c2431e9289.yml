text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from poultry,
  they have distinct differences in terms of preparation, nutritional content, and
  culinary usage. Chicken patties are usually formed into a flat, round shape and
  can be breaded or unbreaded, while chicken thighs are a specific cut of the chicken
  leg. These differences result in variations in cooking methods and nutritional values,
  making them distinct instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
