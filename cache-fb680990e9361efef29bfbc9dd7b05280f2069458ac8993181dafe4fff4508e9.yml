  Mustard seeds and pomegranate seeds are distinct types of seeds that come from different
  plants and have different nutritional profiles. Mustard seeds are commonly used
  as a spice and are high in selenium, while pomegranate seeds are often eaten for
  their juicy, antioxidant-rich fruit and contain important vitamins like Vitamin
  C and K. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
