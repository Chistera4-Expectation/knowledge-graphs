  Although Arborio rice and Basmati rice can both be classified under the general
  category of "rice," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they
  have distinct properties and uses in cooking. Arborio rice is an Italian short-grain
  rice that is typically used for making risotto due to its high starch content, which
  gives risotto its creamy texture. On the other hand, Basmati rice is a long-grain
  rice from India and Pakistan that is known for its aromatic quality and fluffy texture
  when cooked, making it ideal for dishes like biryani and pilaf. Therefore, these
  two types of rice have different culinary applications and cannot be considered
  duplicates.'
