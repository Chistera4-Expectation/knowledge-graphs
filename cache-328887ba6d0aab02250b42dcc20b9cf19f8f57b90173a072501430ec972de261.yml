text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. 'Lemon juice' and 'Lemon' are not semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are related, they are different entities.
  'Lemon' refers to the fruit itself, while 'Lemon juice' refers to the liquid extracted
  from the fruit. They have different nutritional properties and are used differently
  in recipes and meal planning.
