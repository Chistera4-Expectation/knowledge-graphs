  While curry powder and bouillon powder are both used to add flavor to dishes, they
  have different ingredients, uses, and flavors. Curry powder is typically made from
  a blend of spices such as turmeric, coriander, cumin, and chili peppers, while bouillon
  powder is usually made from meat or vegetable broth that has been dehydrated and
  seasoned with herbs and spices. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two concepts as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
