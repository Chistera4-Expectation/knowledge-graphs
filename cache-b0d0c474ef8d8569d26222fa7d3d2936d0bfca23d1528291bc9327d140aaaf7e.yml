  The term "vegetables" refers to a category of plant-based foods that are typically
  grown above ground and have a high water content, such as leafy greens, root vegetables,
  and legumes. On the other hand, "vegetable shortening" is a type of fat used in
  cooking and baking, derived from vegetable oils such as soybean oil or canola oil.
  While both terms contain the word "vegetable," they refer to different concepts
  and serve different purposes, making them distinct entities rather than duplicates.'
