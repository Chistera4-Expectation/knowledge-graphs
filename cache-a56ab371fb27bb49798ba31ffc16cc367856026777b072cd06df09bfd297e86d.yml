text: ' The most appropriate classification for ''Grasshopper Tacos'' would be under
  the category of "Exotic Cuisine" or "Insect-based Food". This is because grasshoppers
  are not commonly consumed in many cultures and their use as an ingredient in a dish
  like tacos makes it an exotic or unconventional food choice. Additionally, since
  insects such as grasshoppers can be considered a source of protein, they may fall
  under the umbrella term of "Alternative Protein Sources", but this might not be
  as concise as simply referring to them as "exotic cuisine."'
