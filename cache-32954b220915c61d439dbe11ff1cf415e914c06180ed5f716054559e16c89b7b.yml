text: No, French Yogurt and Probiotic Yogurt should not be merged together as they
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. French Yogurt refers to the origin of
  the yogurt, while Probiotic Yogurt refers to the presence of beneficial bacteria.
  These two types of yogurt can be distinct and may have different nutritional properties.
