text: No, they should not be merged together. While they both belong to the class
  "Butter," they have distinct differences in terms of their production and composition,
  which makes them separate entities. Cultured butter is made from fermented cream,
  while lactose-free butter is made from regular butter that has had the lactose removed
  or reduced through various processes.
