  While both "chicken broth" and "grilled chicken" are types of poultry-derived food,
  they serve different purposes and have distinct nutritional profiles. Chicken broth
  is primarily a liquid made by simmering chicken parts with vegetables and seasonings,
  while grilled chicken refers to chicken meat that has been cooked on a grill. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates
  since they represent unique culinary concepts and applications.'
