text: ' No. Alfalfa honey and fireweed honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They come from different
  flower sources (alfalfa vs. fireweed), which gives them unique flavors, colors,
  and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is important to maintain these distinctions
  when discussing various types of honey.'
