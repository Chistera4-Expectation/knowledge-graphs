text: Yes, if the two instances, 'All-purpose flour' and 'Flour', represent the same
  type of flour, they should be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  This would eliminate redundancy and improve the consistency of the Bread class.
  However, if 'All-purpose flour' is a specific type of flour within the broader category
  of 'Flour,' then they should remain as distinct instances. The decision should be
  based on the intended meaning and scope of the class.
