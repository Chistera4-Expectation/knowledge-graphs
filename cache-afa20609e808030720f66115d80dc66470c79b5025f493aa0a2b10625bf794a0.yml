text: ' No, corn husks and corn tortillas should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are related to corn, they serve different purposes and have
  unique properties. Corn husks are the outer leaves of an ear of corn and are often
  used for wrapping tamales or grilling vegetables, while corn tortillas are thin
  flatbreads made from masa (corn dough) that are commonly used in Mexican cuisine.
  Therefore, they belong to distinct categories within the edible vegetable class.'
