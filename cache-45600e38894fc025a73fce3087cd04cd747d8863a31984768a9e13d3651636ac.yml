text: No, they should not be merged together. While both crab meat and king crab are
  edible crustaceans, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Crab meat is
  a general term for the meat of various crab species, whereas king crab refers specifically
  to a certain type of large crab. Merging them would result in a loss of distinction
  between different types of crab meat.
