  While cumin powder and red chili powder may both be types of spices, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct properties, uses,
  and flavors that make them unique from one another. Cumin powder is made from ground
  cumin seeds and has a warm, earthy flavor commonly used in Indian, Mexican, and
  Middle Eastern cuisine. Red chili powder, on the other hand, is made from dried
  and ground red chilies and imparts heat and pungency to dishes, popularly utilized
  in various Asian and Latin American culinary traditions. Therefore, it would not
  be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
