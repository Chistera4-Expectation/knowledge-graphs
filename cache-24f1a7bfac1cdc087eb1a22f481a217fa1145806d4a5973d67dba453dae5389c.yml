text: ' The most adequate class for "Diced Tomatoes" would be "Edible Vegetable."
  This is because diced tomatoes are typically considered to be a vegetable in terms
  of their nutritional content and culinary uses. Other classes that might also be
  somewhat appropriate, but not as suitable as "Edible Vegetable," could include "Food
  Seasoning" (since diced tomatoes can be used to add flavor to dishes) or "Sauce"
  (since they can be used as an ingredient in sauces). However, these other classes
  do not accurately capture the overall nature of diced tomatoes as a standalone food
  item.'
