text: ' No. Creamed honey and linden honey are not semantic nor ontological duplicates,
  even though they both belong to the category of "honey." They have distinct characteristics
  that set them apart from one another. Creamed honey refers to a type of honey that
  has been whipped to create a smooth, spreadable consistency, while linden honey
  is a variety with a light color and floral taste derived from nectar collected by
  bees from linden trees. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two
  terms as duplicates.'
