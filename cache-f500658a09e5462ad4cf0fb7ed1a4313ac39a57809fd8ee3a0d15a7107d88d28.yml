  While "cold cereals" is a category of breakfast cereals that includes many different
  brands such as Life cereal, it is not a duplicate of any specific brand like Life
  cereal. Cold cereals refer to a type of food product that can include various ingredients,
  flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles based on their manufacturer. On the
  other hand, Life cereal is a particular brand created by Quaker Oats with its unique
  formulation, taste, appearance, and packaging. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the distinct concepts they denote.'
