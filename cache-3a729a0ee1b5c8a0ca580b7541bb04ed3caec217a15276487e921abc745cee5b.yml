text: ' No. While both Oyster and Portobello mushrooms belong to the same genus (Pleurotus)
  and share some similarities in appearance and culinary uses, they are distinct species
  with different characteristics and flavors. Therefore, it is not appropriate to
  merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
