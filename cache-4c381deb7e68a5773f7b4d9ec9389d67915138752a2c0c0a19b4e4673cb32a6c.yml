text: ' Neither coffee nor tea are appropriate classes for antibiotic infusions. Antibiotics
  are medications used to treat bacterial infections, while coffee and tea are beverages
  made from roasted beans or leaves respectively. Therefore, there is no suitable
  class name for "Antibiotic Infusion" between these two options as they belong to
  different categories.'
