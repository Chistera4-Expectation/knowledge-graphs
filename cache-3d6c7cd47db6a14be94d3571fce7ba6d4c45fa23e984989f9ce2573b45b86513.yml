text: No, 'Bluefish' and 'Monkfish' should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of edible fish, they belong
  to different species with distinct characteristics, appearances, and flavors. Merging
  them would result in a loss of specificity and accuracy in classifying and discussing
  these fish species.
