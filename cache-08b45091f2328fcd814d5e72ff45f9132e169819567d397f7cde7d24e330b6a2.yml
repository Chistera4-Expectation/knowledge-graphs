text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are derived from pork, they are distinct dishes with different preparation methods
  and cuts of meat. Pork Schnitzel is a thin, breaded cutlet, while Pork Shank is
  a cut of meat from the lower part of the leg, often braised or roasted.
