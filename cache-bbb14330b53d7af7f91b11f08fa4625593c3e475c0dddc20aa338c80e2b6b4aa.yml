text: No, 'Cottage cheese' and 'Ricotta cheese' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of cheese, they have distinct
  properties, flavors, and uses in recipes. Merging them would not accurately represent
  the differences between these two types of cheese.
