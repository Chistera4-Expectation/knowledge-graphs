text: As a dietician, my answer is no. Although both Guinea Fowl Nuggets and Quail
  Nuggets are poultry-derived food, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  They are different types of poultry meat and could potentially have different nutritional
  profiles and flavor characteristics. Merging them together would not accurately
  represent the variety of options available in the Poultry-derived Food class.
