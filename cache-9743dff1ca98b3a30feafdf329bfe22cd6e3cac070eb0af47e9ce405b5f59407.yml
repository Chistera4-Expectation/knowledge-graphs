text: No, Chamomile Tea and Green Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are different types of tea with distinct characteristics, flavors,
  and health benefits. Although they both fall under the broader category of tea,
  they are not the same and should be treated as separate instances.
