text: ' "Dairy Product" would be the most appropriate class for sour cream. This is
  because sour cream is made from cream, which is a dairy product, and it shares many
  characteristics with other dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. Additionally,
  sour cream is often used in similar ways to butter and milk in cooking and baking,
  making "Dairy Product" a broad enough category to include all of these items.'
