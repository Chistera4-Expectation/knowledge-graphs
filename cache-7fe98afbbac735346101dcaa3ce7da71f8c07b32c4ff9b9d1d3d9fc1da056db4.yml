  While coriander powder and cumin powder are both ground spices commonly used in
  cooking, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they come from
  different plants, have distinct flavors, aromas, and nutritional profiles. Therefore,
  it is essential to maintain them as separate entities with unique properties and
  purposes in culinary applications.'
