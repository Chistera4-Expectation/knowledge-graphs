  While both raw fish and sashimi-grade fish can be consumed raw, they do not represent
  the same concept and are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Raw fish is any
  fish that has not been cooked or processed with heat, while sashimi-grade fish refers
  to a specific quality of fish that meets strict standards for freshness, handling,
  and freezing, making it safe to consume raw according to food safety guidelines.
  Therefore, these two concepts have distinct meanings and uses.'
