  While pork belly and pork roast both come from pigs and are types of pork products,
  they have different culinary uses and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Instead,
  each food item should retain its distinct identity within the Pork-derived Food
  class.'
