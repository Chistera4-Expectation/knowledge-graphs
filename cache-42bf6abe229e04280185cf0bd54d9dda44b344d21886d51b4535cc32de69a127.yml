text: ' No. Buckwheat honey and orange blossom honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They have
  distinct taste, color, and flavor profiles due to the different nectar sources from
  which their bees collect pollen. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as
  separate entities with unique properties.'
