text: As a dietician, I would say that "Black pepper" and "Ground black pepper" are
  not semantic and ontologic duplicates, but they are related and can be considered
  variations of the same spice. While both refer to the same plant source, they differ
  in their form and processing. Black pepper is the whole dried fruit of the pepper
  plant, while ground black pepper is the crushed or powdered form of the dried fruit.
  Therefore, it would be appropriate to keep them as separate instances in the Spice
  class, as they serve different culinary purposes and may have different nutritional
  and flavor profiles.
