  Although "Italian Seasoning" and "Taco Seasoning" might seem similar because they
  are both types of seasoning mixes used for adding flavor to dishes, they contain
  different ingredients and are typically used in distinct cuisines (Italian vs Mexican).
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
