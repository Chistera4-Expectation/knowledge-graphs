  Although both Eucalyptus honey and Sage honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  differences in their taste, aroma, and plant sources (eucalyptus plants vs sage
  plants). Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological
  duplicates since they represent unique subcategories within the broader category
  of "honey." Each type has its own characteristics that may matter for various applications
  such as cooking, baking, tea blending, health remedies, etc., so preserving these
  distinctions can provide value to users who rely on this information.'
