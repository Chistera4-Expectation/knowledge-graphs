text: No, they should not be merged. Alkaline water and boiling water are different
  types of water with distinct properties and uses. Alkaline water has a higher pH
  level and is believed to have potential health benefits, while boiling water is
  used to kill pathogens and make water safe for consumption. Merging them would not
  accurately represent the differences between the two types of water.
