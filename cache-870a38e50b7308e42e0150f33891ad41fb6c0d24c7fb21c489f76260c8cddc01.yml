text: No, Ostrich Tenders and Ostrich Wings should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both derived from ostriches, they represent
  different cuts of meat with distinct characteristics, preparation methods, and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
