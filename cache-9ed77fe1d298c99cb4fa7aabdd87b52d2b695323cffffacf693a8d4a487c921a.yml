  more context and understanding of the specific classification system being used.
  However, in general, if 'Butter Blend' and 'Unsalted Butter' have the same semantic
  and ontological properties, they could potentially be merged as duplicates. It would
  be important to consider the specific definitions, ingredients, and nutritional
  values of each type of butter to make an informed decision.
