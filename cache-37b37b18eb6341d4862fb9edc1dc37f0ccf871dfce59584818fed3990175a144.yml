  No, Chili bean sauce and Satay sauce should not be merged together as they have
  different ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. Chili bean sauce typically
  contains fermented soybeans, chili peppers, and spices, while Satay sauce is made
  from peanuts, coconut milk, and spices. Although both sauces can add flavor to dishes,
  they are distinct in their composition and applications.'
