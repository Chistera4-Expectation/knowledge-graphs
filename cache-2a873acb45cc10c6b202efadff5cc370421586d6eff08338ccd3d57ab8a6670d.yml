text: No, the instances 'Hen of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Reishi Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible
  mushrooms, they have different appearances, tastes, and health benefits. Hen of
  the Woods Mushroom (Grifola frondosa) is known for its savory and earthy flavor,
  while Reishi Mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) has a bitter taste and is more commonly
  used for its medicinal properties. These differences warrant separate classifications
  within the Edible Mushrooms class.
