text: No, they should not be merged. Although both "Blueberry Honey" and "Sunflower
  Honey" are types of honey, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they come from different sources (blueberry flowers and sunflower flowers, respectively).
  They have distinct characteristics, such as flavor and color, and should be treated
  as separate instances in a class hierarchy.
