  While both "mechanically separated meat" and "thigh meat" are types of poultry-derived
  food, they refer to different processes and parts of the animal. Mechanically separated
  meat is produced by removing meat from bones using machines, while thigh meat comes
  from a specific part of the bird''s leg. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
