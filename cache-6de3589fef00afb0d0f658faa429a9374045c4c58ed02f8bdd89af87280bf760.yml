text: ' No. Ranch dressing and soy sauce dressing are two distinct types of dressings
  with different ingredients and culinary uses. While they can both be used to add
  flavor to food, their compositions and nutritional properties differ significantly.
  Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic or ontologic duplicates.'
