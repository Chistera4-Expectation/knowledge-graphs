text: No, "Pheasant Meat" and "Pheasant Stock" should not be merged together as they
  are different types of poultry-derived food. Pheasant Meat refers to the actual
  muscle tissue of the pheasant, while Pheasant Stock refers to the liquid that results
  from simmering pheasant bones and other ingredients, typically used as a base for
  soups, sauces, or gravies. Although they both come from the same source, they are
  distinct food items with different uses and nutritional profiles.
