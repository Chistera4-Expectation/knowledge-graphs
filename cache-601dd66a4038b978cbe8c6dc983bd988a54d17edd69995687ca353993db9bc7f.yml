text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Turkey
  broth and turkey patties are distinct food items made from different parts of the
  turkey and prepared differently. Turkey broth is a liquid made by simmering turkey
  bones and/or meat, while turkey patties are ground turkey meat shaped into patties
  and typically cooked like a burger. Although they are both poultry-derived, they
  serve different culinary purposes and are not duplicates.
