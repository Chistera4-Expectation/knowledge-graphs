text: ' No. Cottonseed oil and extra virgin olive oil are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils, they
  have different chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses due
  to their unique extraction processes. Therefore, it is important to distinguish
  between these two types of oils when providing information about them.'
