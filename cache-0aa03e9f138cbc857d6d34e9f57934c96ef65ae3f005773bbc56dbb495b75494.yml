text: ' No. Horseradish dressing and Italian dressing are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they can both be classified as food dressings, they have distinct
  ingredients, flavors, and uses that make them unique from one another. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances together.'
