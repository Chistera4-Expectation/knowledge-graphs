  While both cooked white rice and jasmine rice are types of rice that have been cooked,
  they differ in terms of their nutritional content, taste, texture, and culinary
  uses. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between them rather than merging
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  For example, jasmine rice is a type of long-grain rice that originated in Thailand
  and has a distinctive fragrant aroma and slightly sticky texture when cooked. It
  contains more calories and carbohydrates per serving compared to regular cooked
  white rice but also provides a higher amount of fiber and some essential minerals
  like magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc.


  In contrast, cooked white rice refers to any variety of rice (such as basmati, short-grain,
  or medium-grain) that has been boiled or steamed until tender and fluffy. Cooked
  white rice generally has fewer calories and lower levels of fiber and micronutrients
  than jasmine rice.


  Therefore, maintaining separate categories for these two items allows for greater
  accuracy and specificity in describing their unique properties and applications.'
