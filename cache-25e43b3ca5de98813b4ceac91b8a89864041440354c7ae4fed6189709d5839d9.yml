text: ' No. Cream cheese and other types of cheeses have distinct nutritional profiles
  and characteristics that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge "Cream cheese" with "Name of the cheese" as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Each type of cheese should be treated as separate entities
  within a well-structured classification system for accurate representation of their
  properties and relationships.'
