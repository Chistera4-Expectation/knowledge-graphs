text: No, the instances 'Mushrooms' and 'Reishi Mushroom' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Mushrooms' is a general term referring to
  the edible fungi, while 'Reishi Mushroom' is a specific type of mushroom with unique
  properties and characteristics. They are not duplicates, as they represent different
  concepts in the domain of edible mushrooms.
