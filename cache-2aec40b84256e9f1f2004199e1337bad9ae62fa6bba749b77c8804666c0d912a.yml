text: No, 'Turkey Drumsticks' and 'Turkey Gizzards' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from turkey, they
  are different parts of the animal with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses. Merging them would not accurately represent the information and distinctions
  between these two food items.
