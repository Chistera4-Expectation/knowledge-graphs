text: No, Dandelion Honey and Raspberry Honey should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are types of honey, they have distinct flavors
  and characteristics due to the different floral sources (dandelions and raspberries)
  used in their production. Merging them would not accurately represent the variety
  of honey types available and the unique qualities of each.
