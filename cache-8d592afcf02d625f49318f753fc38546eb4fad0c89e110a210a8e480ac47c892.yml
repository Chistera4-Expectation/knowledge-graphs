text: No, "Duck Liver" and "Duck Stock" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from ducks, they are different
  food items with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. "Duck Liver" is
  an organ meat, while "Duck Stock" is a liquid preparation made by simmering duck
  bones, vegetables, and other ingredients.
