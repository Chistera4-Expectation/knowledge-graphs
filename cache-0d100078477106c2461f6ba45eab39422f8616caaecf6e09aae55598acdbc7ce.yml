  While sushi rice and white rice are both types of rice, they have different properties
  and uses in cooking. Sushi rice is a short-grain variety that becomes sticky when
  cooked, making it ideal for dishes like sushi rolls and rice bowls topped with fish
  or vegetables. White rice, on the other hand, can refer to various long-, medium-,
  or short-grain varieties, including jasmine, basmati, and arborio rice. These types
  do not become as sticky as sushi rice when cooked, so they are more suitable for
  dishes such as stir-fries, pilafs, or plain steamed rice served alongside curry
  or stew. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate entities for sushi rice
  and white rice in your database or knowledge graph.'
