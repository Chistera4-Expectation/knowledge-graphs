text: ' No. Arborio rice is a type of rice that has specific characteristics and uses,
  particularly in Italian dishes such as risotto. While it is still considered a variety
  of rice, merging it with the general term "rice" would result in a loss of important
  distinctions and potentially lead to confusion. Therefore, it is best to keep these
  two instances separate to maintain accuracy and clarity in classification and description.'
