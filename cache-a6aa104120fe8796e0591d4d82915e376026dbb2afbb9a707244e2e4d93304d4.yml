text: ' The most adequate class for "Oil for frying" would be "Edible Vegetal Oil".
  This category includes oils that are derived from plants and are suitable for cooking
  and frying. Other categories such as "Food Dressing", "Food Seasoning", and "Sauce"
  may also contain oil, but they are not exclusively dedicated to it.'
