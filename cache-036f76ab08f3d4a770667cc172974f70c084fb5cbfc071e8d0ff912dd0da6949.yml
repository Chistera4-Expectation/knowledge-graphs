text: No, the instances 'Duck Breast' and 'Duck Wings' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from ducks, they
  are distinct cuts of meat with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived
  food options.
