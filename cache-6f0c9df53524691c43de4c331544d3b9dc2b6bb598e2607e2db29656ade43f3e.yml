text: ' The most adequate class for barbecue sauce would be "Food Seasoning." Barbecue
  sauce is primarily used to add flavor and seasoning to various foods, rather than
  serving as the main component of a meal. Other classes such as "Sauce" could also
  work, but "Food Seasoning" more accurately describes the primary function of barbecue
  sauce in cooking.'
