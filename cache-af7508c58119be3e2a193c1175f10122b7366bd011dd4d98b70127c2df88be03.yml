text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  they both belong to the spice class, they have distinct properties, tastes, and
  uses in cooking. Black pepper has a sharp, pungent flavor, while dried Cameroon
  pepper has a smoky, spicy taste. Merging them would disregard these differences
  and could lead to confusion in culinary applications.
