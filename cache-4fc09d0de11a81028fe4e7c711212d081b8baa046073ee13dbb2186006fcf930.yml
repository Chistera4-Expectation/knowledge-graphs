text: ' No. While both "Calories per serving" and "Sodium per serving" provide information
  about nutritional content, they measure different aspects of nutrition and are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. Calories refer to the amount of energy contained
  in food, while sodium is an essential mineral that helps regulate fluid balance
  in the body. Therefore, it is important to keep these two attributes separate when
  describing cheese varieties in a classification system.'
