  \ or ontologically duplicates.\n\n* **Semantic duplicates:** Two instances are semantically\
  \ duplicates if they have the same meaning or refer to the same concept. In this\
  \ case, 'Earl Grey tea' and 'Flora tea petals' are not semantically duplicates,\
  \ as they represent different concepts:\n    * **Earl Grey tea:** A specific type\
  \ of tea blend made with black tea, bergamot oil, and other flavorings.\n    * **Flora\
  \ tea petals:** A general concept of tea petals used in various teas, such as Hibiscus\
  \ tea, Rose tea, and Chamomile tea.\n\n* **Ontological duplicates:** Two instances\
  \ are ontologically duplicates if they have the same structure or organization.\
  \ In this case, 'Earl Grey tea' and 'Flora tea petals' are not ontologically duplicates,\
  \ as they belong to different ontological categories:\n    * **Earl Grey tea:**\
  \ Falls under the category of tea blends.\n    * **Flora tea petals:** Fall under\
