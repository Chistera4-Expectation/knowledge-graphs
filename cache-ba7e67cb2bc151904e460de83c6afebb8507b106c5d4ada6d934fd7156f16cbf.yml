text: ' No. While curry leaves and fresh cilantro leaves may share some similarities
  as both being used for flavoring in cooking, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They come from different plants (Murraya koenigii for curry leaves and
  Coriandrum sativum for ciltaro), have distinct flavors, appearances, and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entities in an
  edible vegetable classification system.'
