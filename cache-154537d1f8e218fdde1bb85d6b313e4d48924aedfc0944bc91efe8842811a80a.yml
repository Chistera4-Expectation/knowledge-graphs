  Artificial sweeteners like saccharin are a type of sweetener, but they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. They represent a specific category of sweeteners that
  are synthetic or heavily processed, as opposed to naturally occurring ones (e.g.,
  honey, maple syrup). Keeping them separate allows for more accurate categorization
  and differentiation when discussing various types of sweeteners and their potential
  health impacts.'
