text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of rice, they
  have different properties and uses. Short-grain rice has a higher starch content
  and tends to stick together when cooked, making it ideal for dishes like sushi and
  risotto. White rice, on the other hand, can refer to various types of rice that
  have had their outer husk, bran, and germ removed, resulting in a white color. White
  rice can include long-grain, medium-grain, and short-grain varieties, but the term
  "white rice" by itself does not specify the grain size.
