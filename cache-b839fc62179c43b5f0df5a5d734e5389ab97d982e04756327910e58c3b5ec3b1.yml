text: No, they should not be merged. While both are types of beef, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their preparation, texture, and use in recipes. Corned beef
  brisket is a salt-cured beef product, while ground beef is simply minced beef. They
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
