text: No, Long-grain Rice and Parboiled Rice should not be merged as they have distinct
  characteristics. Long-grain Rice refers to a specific type of rice with a long,
  slender grain, while Parboiled Rice is a type of rice that has been partially boiled
  in the husk before being dried and milled. Although both types can be long-grain,
  their processing and characteristics are different.
