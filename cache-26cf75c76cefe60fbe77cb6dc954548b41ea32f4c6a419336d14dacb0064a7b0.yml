text: No, they should not be merged together. While both 'Duck Soup' and 'Duck Tenders'
  are derived from the same animal, they represent different food items with distinct
  preparation methods and serving styles. 'Duck Soup' is a liquid dish made from duck
  meat and broth, while 'Duck Tenders' refer to pieces of duck meat that are typically
  breaded and fried. Thus, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
