text: ' No. While lemons and lemon wedges are related, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. A lemon is the entire fruit, while a lemon wedge is a specific portion
  or slice of a lemon, typically used for garnish or consumption on its own. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to distinguish between these two concepts.'
