  While both Adobo seasoning and Maggi seasoning cubes can be used to add flavor to
  food, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different ingredients,
  with Adobo seasoning typically including garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, turmeric,
  and other spices, while Maggi seasoning cubes contain monosodium glutamate (MSG),
  salt, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and various flavors. Therefore, they cannot be
  merged as duplicates.'
