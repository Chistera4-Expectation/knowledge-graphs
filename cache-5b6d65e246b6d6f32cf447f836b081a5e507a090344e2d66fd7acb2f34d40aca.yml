text: ' No. While both "Optional protein" and "Protein source" may involve adding
  protein to one''s diet, they do not mean exactly the same thing. "Protein source"
  refers specifically to the food or ingredient that provides the protein (e.g., beef),
  while "Optional protein" implies that protein is not strictly necessary for the
  recipe but can be added if desired. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two instances as they have distinct meanings and uses within the context of
  a beef class.'
