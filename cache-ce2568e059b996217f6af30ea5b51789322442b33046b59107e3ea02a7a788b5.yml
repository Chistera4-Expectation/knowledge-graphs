text: ' Caviar is most adequately classified under ''Edible Fish'' as it is the reproductive
  eggs or roe of various species of sturgeon, which are fish. However, caviar can
  also be considered an edible delicacy that transcends these categories due to its
  unique taste and high nutritional value.'
