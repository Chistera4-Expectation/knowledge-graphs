text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Probiotic Yogurt and Skyr
  Yogurt are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics and properties. Probiotic
  Yogurt is specifically known for its beneficial bacteria that can improve gut health,
  whereas Skyr Yogurt is an Icelandic yogurt that is typically strained and has a
  thicker consistency. Merging these two classes would not accurately represent the
  unique qualities of each type of yogurt.
