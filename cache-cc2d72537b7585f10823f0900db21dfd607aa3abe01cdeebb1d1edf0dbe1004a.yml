text: As a dietician, I would need more information about the specific details of
  the 'Blueberry Lavender Infusion' and 'Raspberry Sage Infusion' to determine if
  they are semantic and ontologic duplicates. However, based on the provided information,
  they appear to be different types of tea infusions due to their unique flavor combinations.
  Therefore, my answer would be no, they should not be merged together as duplicates.
