  Evaporated milk and other plant-based milks like oat milk are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They belong to different categories: one is a type of dairy milk that
  has undergone evaporation, while the other refers to various plant-derived alternatives
  to traditional dairy milk. Merging them would result in an incorrect categorization
  and confusion regarding their unique properties and uses.'
