text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Ostrich Stock and Quail Stock
  are poultry-derived stocks, they are derived from different types of poultry and
  may have different nutritional profiles and flavor characteristics. They should
  be kept as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
