text: No, Taro Cake and Turnip Cake should not be merged as they are distinct dishes
  made from different primary ingredients (taro and turnip, respectively). While they
  share similarities in terms of preparation and being part of the Edible Vegetable
  class, they are separate dishes with unique flavors and textures.
