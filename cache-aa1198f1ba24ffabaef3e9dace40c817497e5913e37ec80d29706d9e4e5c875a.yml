text: No, the instances 'Fresh Mozzarella Cheese' and 'Pecorino Romano Cheese' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are types
  of cheese, they have distinct characteristics and properties that make them unique.
  Merging them would result in a loss of information and potentially misleading categorization.
