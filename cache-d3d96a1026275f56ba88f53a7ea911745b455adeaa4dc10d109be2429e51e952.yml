text: ' No. While both "crabs" and "lump crab meat" are related to edible crustaceans,
  they do not represent the same level of specificity within the hierarchy of food
  classification. "Crabs" is a more general category that includes various species
  and forms of crustaceans commonly known as crabs, while "lump crab meat" refers
  to a particular type of processed product made from certain types of crabs (such
  as blue crabs). Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
