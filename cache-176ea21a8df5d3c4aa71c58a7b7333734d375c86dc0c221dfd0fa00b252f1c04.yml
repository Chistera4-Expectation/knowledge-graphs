text: No, the instances 'Vegan Yogurt' and 'Yogurt' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Vegan yogurt is a specific type of yogurt
  made without animal-derived ingredients, while yogurt is a more general term encompassing
  all types of yogurt, including those made with animal products. Merging them would
  lead to a loss of information about the distinct qualities and characteristics of
  each type.
