text: ' No. While both hot peppers and pepper (black pepper) are types of seasonings
  that can add flavor to food, they belong to different taxonomic categories within
  the plant kingdom. Hot peppers are fruits from plants belonging to the genus Capsicum
  and include varieties such as jalapenos, habaneros, and cayenne peppers. They contain
  capsaicin, which gives them their spicy heat. On the other hand, black pepper is
  obtained from the dried berries of Piper nigrum, a climbing vine native to South
  India. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as semantic
  and ontological duplicates since they have distinct botanical identities and uses.'
