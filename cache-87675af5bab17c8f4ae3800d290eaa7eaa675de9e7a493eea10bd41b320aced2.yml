text: No, Cashew Milk and Rice Milk should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates because they are derived from different sources (cashews and
  rice, respectively). Although they both fall under the category of plant-based milk
  alternatives, they have distinct nutritional profiles and properties.
