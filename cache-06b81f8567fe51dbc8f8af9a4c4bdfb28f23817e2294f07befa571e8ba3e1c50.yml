  While peanut oil and walnut oil are both edible vegetable oils, they come from different
  sources (peanuts vs. walnuts) with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They each require separate listings due to their unique characteristics.'
