  While both Arborio and Basmati are types of rice, they have distinct differences
  in terms of their grain texture, cooking time, and flavor profile. Arborio rice
  is known for its creamy texture and ability to absorb flavors, making it ideal for
  risotto dishes. Basmati rice, on the other hand, has a nutty flavor and fluffy texture,
  making it popular in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine. These differences make them
  unique and worth distinguishing as separate instances in the Rice class.'
