text: No, Icelandic Yogurt and Lassi Yogurt should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics and
  origins. Icelandic Yogurt, also known as Skyr, is a thick, creamy yogurt with a
  mild taste, originating from Iceland. Lassi Yogurt, on the other hand, is a drink
  made from yogurt, water, and various spices, often enjoyed in India and other parts
  of South Asia. Therefore, they are different enough in their properties and cultural
  contexts to warrant separate classifications.
