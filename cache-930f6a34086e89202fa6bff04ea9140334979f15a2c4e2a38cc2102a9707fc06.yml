  Quinoa seeds and chia seeds are different types of edible seeds with distinct nutritional
  profiles and culinary uses, so they should not be merged as duplicates. Quinoa seeds
  are a complete protein source rich in fiber, iron, and magnesium, while chia seeds
  are high in omega-3 fatty acids and have a gel-like texture when hydrated. In the
  context of the "Edible Seeds" class, both instances can coexist separately to represent
  their unique characteristics and uses.'
