text: ' No. While chili pepper is a more general term that includes habanero peppers,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct characteristics
  such as taste, heat level, and geographical origin. Merging them would result in
  loss of important distinctions between different types of peppers within the spicy
  food domain.'
