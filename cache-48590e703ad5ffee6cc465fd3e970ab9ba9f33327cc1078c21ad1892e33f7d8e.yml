text: ' The most adequate class for "seafood of choice" would be ''Edible Fish'' and
  ''Edible Crustaceans''. These options are the closest related to seafood, as they
  specifically refer to types of fish and crustaceans that can be consumed. Other
  choices like mollusks or edible mushrooms might also include some kinds of seafood
  but focusing on these two categories is more specific and accurate.'
