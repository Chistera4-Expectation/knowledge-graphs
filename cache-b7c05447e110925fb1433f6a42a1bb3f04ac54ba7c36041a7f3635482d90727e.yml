text: ' No. Scotch bonnet pepper and white pepper powder are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. They refer to two distinct spices that differ in taste, heat level,
  appearance, and culinary uses. While both can add flavor to dishes, they belong
  to different categories of ingredients and cannot be used interchangeably in all
  recipes.'
