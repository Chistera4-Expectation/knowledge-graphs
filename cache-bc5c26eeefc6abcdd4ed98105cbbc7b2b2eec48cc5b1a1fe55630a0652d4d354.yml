text: No, 'Hydrogen Water' and 'Spring-fed Water' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. While both types of water can be consumed as
  drinking water, they have distinct properties and origins. Hydrogen Water refers
  to water that has been infused with hydrogen gas, which may have certain health
  benefits. Spring-fed Water, on the other hand, is water that naturally flows from
  a spring, and it can be sourced from different locations with varying mineral content.
  Therefore, they should be kept as separate instances in a Drinking Water class.
