text: ' No. Ground pork and pork spare ribs are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of pork products. They have distinct culinary uses, nutritional
  profiles, and physical properties that make them unique within their category. Therefore,
  they should remain separate instances in a well-organized classification system
  for food items.'
