text: ' No. Cottonseed oil and sesame oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. While both are types of edible vegetable
  oils, they come from different plants (cotton seeds vs sesame seeds) and have distinct
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to maintain
  them as separate entities with their unique properties and characteristics.'
