text: No, 'Carrot juice' and 'Grapefruit juice' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both juices, they have distinct ingredients
  and nutritional properties. Merging them would result in a loss of valuable information
  about the differences between the two.
