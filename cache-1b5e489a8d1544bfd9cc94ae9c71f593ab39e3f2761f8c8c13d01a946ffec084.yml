text: No, "Rice Rolls" and "Wild Rice" should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they both involve rice, they are different food items.
  Rice rolls refer to a dish made with rice and various fillings, typically wrapped
  in rice paper or seaweed. Wild rice, on the other hand, is a specific variety of
  rice that is grown and consumed.
