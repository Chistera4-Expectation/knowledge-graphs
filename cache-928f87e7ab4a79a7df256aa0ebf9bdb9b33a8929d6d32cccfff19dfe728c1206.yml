text: As a dietician, my answer is based on the nutritional and culinary aspects of
  these sauces. While both Chimichurri sauce and Curry sauce can be considered semantic
  and ontologic duplicates in terms of their sauce classification, they have distinct
  differences in their ingredients, flavor profiles, and cultural origins. Therefore,
  I would not recommend merging them together. They should be treated as separate
  entities in a dietary context.
