text: No, the instances 'Maitake Mushroom' and 'Reishi Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct species of edible
  mushrooms, each with its own unique nutritional profile and health benefits. While
  both are part of the Edible Mushrooms class, they are separate entities within that
  class.
