text: No, the instances 'Apple Clove Infusion' and 'Lemon Ginger Infusion' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different
  types of infusion drinks with different ingredients and flavors. Although they share
  the same class, they are distinct instances within that class.
