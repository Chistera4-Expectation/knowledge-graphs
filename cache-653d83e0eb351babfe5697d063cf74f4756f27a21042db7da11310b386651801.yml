text: No, they should not be merged. While both "Fish stock" and "Swordfish" are related
  to fish, they represent different concepts. "Fish stock" refers to a liquid made
  by simmering fish bones, vegetables, and aromatics, while "Swordfish" refers to
  a specific type of edible fish. They are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
