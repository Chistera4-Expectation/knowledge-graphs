text: No, 'Broth' and 'Vegetable Broth' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While 'Vegetable Broth' is a specific type of broth
  made from vegetables, 'Broth' is a more general term that can include broths made
  from various ingredients such as meat, bones, or vegetables. Therefore, they are
  not exact duplicates and should be treated as separate instances within the Edible
  Vegetable class.
