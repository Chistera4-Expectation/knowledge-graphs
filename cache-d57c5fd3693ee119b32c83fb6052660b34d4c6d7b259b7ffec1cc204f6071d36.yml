text: No, they should not be merged together as they represent different types of
  poultry-derived foods. Turkey Broth is a liquid made by simmering turkey parts and
  other ingredients, while Turkey Meatballs are a solid food made from ground turkey
  and other ingredients. Although they both involve turkey, they are distinct food
  items with different nutritional profiles and cooking methods.
