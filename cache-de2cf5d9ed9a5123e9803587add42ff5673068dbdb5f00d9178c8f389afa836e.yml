text: No, the 'King Oyster Mushroom' and 'White Button Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as they are different species of edible mushrooms with distinct characteristics,
  nutritional values, and culinary uses. While they both belong to the same class
  of edible mushrooms, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
