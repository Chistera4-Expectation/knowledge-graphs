  However, from a semantic and ontologic perspective, glacier water and rainwater
  are not the same. Glacier water comes from melting glaciers and may contain minerals
  and impurities, while rainwater is formed from the condensation of atmospheric water
  vapor and typically has fewer impurities. Therefore, it would not be accurate to
  merge these two instances as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
