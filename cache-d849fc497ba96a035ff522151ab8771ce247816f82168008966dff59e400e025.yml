text: No, Acacia Honey and Orange Blossom Honey should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have distinct
  flavors, properties, and origins. Acacia Honey comes from the nectar of Acacia flowers,
  while Orange Blossom Honey comes from the nectar of orange tree blossoms. These
  differences make them unique and separate entities within the Honey class.
