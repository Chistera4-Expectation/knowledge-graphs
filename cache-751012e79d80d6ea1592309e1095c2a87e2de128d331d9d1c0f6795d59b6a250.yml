text: No, they should not be merged as they serve different purposes in food preparation.
  Seasonings for filling are typically used to add flavor to the inside of a dish,
  while toppings are added on top for both flavor and aesthetic appeal. Although they
  may have some overlapping ingredients, their usage and roles in food preparation
  are distinct.
