text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from chicken and contain some vegetable content, they are distinct
  types of stock with different compositions. Chicken stock typically consists of
  chicken bones, vegetables, and herbs, while chicken/vegetable stock may have a higher
  vegetable content and less chicken-derived components.
