text: ' No. While both fresh mozzarella and Parmesan are types of cheese, they have
  distinct characteristics that make them unique. Fresh mozzarella has a high moisture
  content, mild flavor, and soft texture, while Parmesan is aged for a longer period
  of time, resulting in a hard, crumbly texture and strong, nutty flavor. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two cheeses as semantic or ontological
  duplicates.'
