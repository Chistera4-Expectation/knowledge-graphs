text: No, the instances 'Boiling water' and 'Sparkling Water' should not be merged
  together as they have distinct characteristics and properties. Boiling water is
  a result of heating water to its boiling point, while sparkling water is water that
  has been carbonated, giving it a fizzy or effervescent quality. These differences
  make them unique entities that should be treated separately.
