text: No, 'Blueberry juice' and 'Grape juice' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates because they represent distinct types of juice made from
  different fruits. They may share some common properties, such as being a liquid
  and containing natural sugars, but they have unique nutritional profiles, flavors,
  and other characteristics that differentiate them from one another.
