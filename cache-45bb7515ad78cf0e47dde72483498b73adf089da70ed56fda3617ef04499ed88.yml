text: No, the instances 'Bluefish' and 'Stockfish' should not be merged as they are
  distinct types of edible fish. Bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) is a species of fish
  found in the Atlantic Ocean, while Stockfish is a traditional method of preserving
  fish, typically cod (Gadus morhua), by drying it in the open air. Although they
  are both edible fish, their names refer to different species and methods of preservation.
