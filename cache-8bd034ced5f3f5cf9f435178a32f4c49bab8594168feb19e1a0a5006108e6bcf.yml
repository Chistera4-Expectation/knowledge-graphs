  Turmeric Honey is best suited for the class of "Tea".


  Although Coffee and Tea both contain caffeine, which can have beneficial effects
  on the body, Turmeric Honey is unique in its composition. It is a traditional Ayurvedic
  remedy made from the extract of turmeric, a herb known for its anti-inflammatory
  properties. The active compound in turmeric, curcumin, has been shown to have several
  health benefits, including reducing inflammation, improving digestion, and boosting
  immunity.'
