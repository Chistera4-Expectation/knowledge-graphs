  While "blackberry honey" and "strawberry honey" may sound similar and both involve
  fruit, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Blackberry honey is made
  by bees that have collected nectar from blackberry flowers, while strawberry honey
  is made from strawberries (which do not produce nectar) being mixed with honey to
  give it flavor. Therefore, they are distinct types of products with different ingredients
  and production methods.'
