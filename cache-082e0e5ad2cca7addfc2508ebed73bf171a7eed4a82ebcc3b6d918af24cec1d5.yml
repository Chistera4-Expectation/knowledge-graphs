text: As a dietician, I would suggest that 'Bell pepper' and 'Red bell pepper' should
  not be merged together as they are different varieties of the same species (Capsicum
  annuum) with distinct appearances and flavors. While both are considered edible
  vegetables, they can be considered as different instances within the Edible Vegetable
  class.
