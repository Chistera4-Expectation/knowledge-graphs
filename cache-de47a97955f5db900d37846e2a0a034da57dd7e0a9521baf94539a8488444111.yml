text: ' No. White pepper powder and habanero pepper are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they both come from peppers, white pepper is made by removing
  the outer skin of dried ripe red peppers and leaving only the inner seed coat which
  results in a milder flavor compared to black pepper. On the other hand, habanero
  pepper is a specific type of chili pepper that has a distinct fruity, citrusy, and
  extremely spicy taste, making it significantly different from white pepper powder.
  Therefore, these two ingredients serve unique functions in cooking and cannot be
  considered as duplicates.'
