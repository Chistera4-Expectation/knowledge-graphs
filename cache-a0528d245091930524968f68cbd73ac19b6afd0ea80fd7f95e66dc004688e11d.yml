text: ' No. Grape seeds and quinoa seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they come from different plants, have different nutritional profiles, and
  are used for different purposes. While both can be considered "seeds," merging them
  as duplicates would not accurately reflect their distinct characteristics and uses.'
