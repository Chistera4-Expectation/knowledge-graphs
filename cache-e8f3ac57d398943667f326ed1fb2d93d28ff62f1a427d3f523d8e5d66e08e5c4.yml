text: 'No, they should not be merged together as they serve different purposes and
  have distinct properties. Cream cheese is a specific type of cheese, while "Optional:
  additional cheese for topping" refers to the possibility of adding more cheese on
  top of the dish, which could be any type of cheese. They are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.'
