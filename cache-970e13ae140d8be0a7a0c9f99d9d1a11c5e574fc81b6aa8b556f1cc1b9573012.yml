text: No, Parboiled Rice and Red Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of rice, they have distinct differences
  in terms of processing, nutritional content, and appearance. Parboiled Rice is a
  type of rice that has been partially boiled in the husk, while Red Rice is a type
  of rice that is typically unpolished and retains its bran layer, giving it a reddish
  color. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of
  each type of rice.
