  While both "breadcrumbs" and "French bread" are types of bread, they have distinct
  characteristics and uses that make them separate entities from an ontological perspective.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.


  Breadcrumbs typically refer to small pieces of bread used as a decorative garnish
  or as a way to soak up sauces or juices on a plate. They can also serve as navigational
  aids on websites by showing users their current location within the site hierarchy.
  On the other hand, French bread is a type of long, thin loaf with a crispy crust
  and soft interior, often enjoyed plain or used for sandwiches like subs or baguettes.
  These two concepts have different meanings and functions, making them non-duplicate
  entities.'
