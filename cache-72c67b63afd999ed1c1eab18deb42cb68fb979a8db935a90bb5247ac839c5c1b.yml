text: No, Pork Belly and Pork Shoulder should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While they both come from pigs, they are different cuts
  of meat with distinct properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Merging them would
  result in a loss of important information and detail.
