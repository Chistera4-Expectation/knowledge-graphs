text: No, Pumpkin seeds and Watermelon seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible seeds, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles, textures, and uses. For instance, pumpkin seeds are higher
  in protein, while watermelon seeds are higher in fat. Additionally, pumpkin seeds
  are commonly eaten as a snack or added to recipes, whereas watermelon seeds are
  often used to grow new watermelon plants.
