text: No, they should not be merged together as they have distinct flavors and uses
  in cooking. Five Spice Powder is a blend of five spices commonly used in Chinese
  cuisine, while Garlic Powder is made from dehydrated garlic and is used to add garlic
  flavor to dishes. They serve different purposes and cannot be considered semantic
  and ontological duplicates.
