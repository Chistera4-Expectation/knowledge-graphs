text: No, the instances 'Juice' and 'Pineapple juice' should not be merged together
  as they represent different types of juices. 'Juice' is a general term for any fruit
  or vegetable juice, while 'Pineapple juice' specifically refers to juice made from
  pineapples. They can be considered subcategories of the broader category of 'Juice',
  but they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
