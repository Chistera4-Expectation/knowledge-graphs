  While both ''beef'' and ''pasture-raised beef'' are types of meat that come from
  cattle, they differ significantly in terms of their production methods, nutritional
  content, and impact on the environment. Therefore, it is important to distinguish
  between them rather than merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Here''s
  why:


  1. Production Methods: Conventional beef can come from animals raised in feedlots
  and fed grains, while pasture-raised beef comes from animals that have been raised
  on open pastures and eat grasses and other forages. These differences in production
  methods can affect the quality, safety, and sustainability of the final product.

  2. Nutritional Content: Pasture-raised beef has been shown to contain higher levels
  of certain beneficial nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids, conjugated linoleic
  acid (CLA), and vitamin E compared to conventionally raised beef. This is because
  the cows'' diets consist mainly of fresh grasses and legumes, which are richer sources
  of these nutrients than corn and soybeans commonly used in conventional feedlot
  operations.

  3. Environmental Impact: The environmental impact of raising beef also varies depending
  on whether it is produced through intensive feeding practices or through more sustainable
  grazing systems like those used in pasture-raising. Intensive beef production contributes
  to greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity,
  whereas well-managed pastoral systems can help sequester carbon dioxide, preserve
  soil health, promote wildlife habitat, and reduce erosion.


  Given these distinctions, it would not be appropriate to merge ''beef'' and ''pasture-raised
  beef'' into a single category, as doing so could obscure essential information about
  each type of food''s unique characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks.'
