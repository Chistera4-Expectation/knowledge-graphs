  While both Greek yogurt dressing and Russian dressing are types of salad dressings,
  they have different ingredients and flavors. Greek yogurt dressing is typically
  made with plain Greek yogurt, herbs, and seasonings, while Russian dressing is usually
  made with mayonnaise, ketchup, horseradish, and spices. Therefore, they cannot be
  considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
