text: No, Flavored Water and Hydrogen Water should not be merged together as they
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of water with
  different properties and purposes. Flavored Water is simply water with added natural
  or artificial flavors, while Hydrogen Water contains dissolved hydrogen gas and
  is believed to have potential health benefits. Although both are types of drinking
  water, they have unique characteristics and should be treated as separate entities.
