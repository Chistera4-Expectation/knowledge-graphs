text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of yogurt with distinct
  characteristics. Fruit-Flavored Yogurt typically contains added fruit flavoring
  or fruit pieces, while Kefir Yogurt is a fermented milk product made with kefir
  grains and has a thinner consistency compared to traditional yogurt.
