  The two instances, "Matcha green tea powder" and "Rooibos tea," are not duplicate
  entries. Matcha is derived from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, whereas Rooibos
  is made from the leaves of Aspalathus linearis. They have different flavors, caffeine
  levels, and nutritional profiles, making them distinct types of tea. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
