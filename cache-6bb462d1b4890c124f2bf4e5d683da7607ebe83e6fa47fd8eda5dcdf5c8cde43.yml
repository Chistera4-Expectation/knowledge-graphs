text: No, they should not be merged together. Ice cream and sour cream are distinct
  dairy products with different nutritional profiles and uses. While they are both
  made from milk, their processing and end product are different. Ice cream is a frozen
  dessert, typically sweetened, while sour cream is a fermented dairy product with
  a tangy flavor. Merging them would not accurately reflect their differences.
