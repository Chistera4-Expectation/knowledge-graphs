text: No, they should not be merged together. While both quail meat and quail patties
  are derived from quail, they have different culinary preparations and uses. Quail
  meat refers to the raw or cooked muscle tissue of the quail, while quail patties
  specifically refer to a dish made by forming a mixture of ground quail meat and
  other ingredients into a patty shape, often for frying or grilling. These differences
  in preparation and usage warrant them being separate instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
