  While both dried red pepper flakes and white pepper come from peppers, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates. Dried red pepper flakes typically consist
  of crushed red chili peppers and have a hot and spicy flavor. In contrast, white
  pepper is made by removing the outer skin of ripe red peppers before they are fully
  dry, giving it a milder taste compared to dried red pepper flakes. Additionally,
  these two ingredients serve different culinary purposes due to their unique flavors
  and appearances.'
