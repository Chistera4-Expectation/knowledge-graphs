text: No, Red Rice and Sushi Rice should not be merged together as they are different
  types of rice with distinct characteristics, uses, and nutritional profiles. Red
  Rice is a whole grain rice with a red husk, while Sushi Rice is a short-grain white
  rice that is typically used for making sushi and other Japanese dishes. Although
  they may both be considered types of rice, they have unique properties and should
  be treated as separate entities in a dietary context.
