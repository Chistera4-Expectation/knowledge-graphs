  While both "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Low-Sodium Chicken Broth" are poultry-derived
  foods, they do not represent semantic and ontological dupes. They serve different
  purposes and have distinct nutritional profiles: one is a complete meal with various
  ingredients (salad), while the other is an ingredient itself (broth). Merging them
  would lead to confusion regarding their unique characteristics.'
