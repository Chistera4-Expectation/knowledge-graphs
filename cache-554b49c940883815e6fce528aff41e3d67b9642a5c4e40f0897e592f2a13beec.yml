  In the context of a poultry-derived food classification system, "chicken broth"
  and "chicken" are not identical concepts. Chicken broth is a liquid made by simmering
  chicken meat, bones, or both in water, while chicken refers to the meat itself.
  They have different nutritional profiles, textures, and uses in cooking. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
