text: ' No. Alfalfa honey and Linden honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they both belong to the "honey" class. They have distinct botanical
  origins (different plant sources), which can affect their taste, color, and nutritional
  profiles. Merging them would disregard these important differences.'
