text: No, "Pheasant Meat" and "Pheasant Tenders" should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both refer to the meat of a pheasant,
  "Pheasant Tenders" typically refers to a specific cut of the meat, often considered
  a delicacy, while "Pheasant Meat" refers to the meat in general. They serve different
  purposes and have different properties within the context of a diet.
