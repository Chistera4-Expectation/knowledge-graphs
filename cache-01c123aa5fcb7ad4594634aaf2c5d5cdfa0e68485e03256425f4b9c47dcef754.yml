text: ' ''Edible Plant-based Milks'' or simply ''Plant-based Milks'' would be the
  most appropriate class for this group, as it accurately describes and distinguishes
  the type of food items that fit into this category. This class can include foods
  such as almond milk, soy milk, oat milk, rice milk, hemp milk, etc., which are all
  derived from plants and used as alternatives to dairy milk.'
