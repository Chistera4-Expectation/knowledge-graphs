text: 'No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of cheese and
  usage in a dish. "Optional: additional cheese for topping" is a generic reference
  to cheese that can be added as a topping, whereas "crumbled feta cheese" specifically
  refers to a type of cheese (feta) and its preparation (crumbled). These two instances
  serve different purposes and should be kept separate in the Cheese class.'
