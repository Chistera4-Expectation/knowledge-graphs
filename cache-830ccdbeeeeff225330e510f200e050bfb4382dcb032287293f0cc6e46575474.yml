text: No, 'Herbal Tea' and 'White Tea' should not be merged together as they are different
  types of tea. Herbal tea is not derived from the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) and
  is instead made from various herbs, fruits, or spices. White tea, on the other hand,
  comes from the tea plant and is a specific type of tea with unique processing methods.
  They can coexist in the same class without being considered duplicates.
