text: No, Cherry and Raspberry should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both fruits, they are distinct and unique types of
  fruit with different nutritional profiles and characteristics. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the variety of fruits available in the Edible Fruit class.
