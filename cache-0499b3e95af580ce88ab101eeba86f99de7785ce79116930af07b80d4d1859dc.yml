  Trans fats and Vitamin A are distinct nutrients that have different effects on health.
  Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat that can negatively impact heart health
  when consumed in excess, while Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin important for
  vision, immune function, and reproduction. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two properties as they provide separate and valuable information
  about the cheese being described.'
