text: ' No. Imitation crab meat and lump crab meat are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged. They refer to different types of products with
  distinct nutritional profiles, ingredients, and culinary uses.


  Imitation crab meat is typically made from surimi (minced fish paste), starch, sugar,
  salt, and additives such as coloring agents, flavor enhancers, and preservatives.
  It has a lower protein content, higher carbohydrate content, and fewer essential
  amino acids than real crab meat. Its texture resembles that of crab meat but lacks
  its natural flavors and nutrients.


  Lump crab meat comes directly from blue crabs and can contain large chunks of white
  flesh. It is high in lean protein, low in fat, and contains various vitamins and
  minerals like B12, zinc, copper, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids. Lump crab meat
  is considered a premium seafood product due to its rich taste and delicate texture.


  Therefore, it would be misleading to merge these two terms into one category because
  they have significant differences in their composition, quality, and applications.'
