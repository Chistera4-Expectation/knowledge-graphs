text: ' No. Ripe plantains and plantains refer to different stages of maturity and
  ripeness of the same fruit (plantain). While they are related, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Therefore, it is appropriate to treat them
  as separate instances within the Edible Fruit class.'
