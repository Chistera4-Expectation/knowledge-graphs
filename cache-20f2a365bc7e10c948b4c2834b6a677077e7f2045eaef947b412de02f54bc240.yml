text: No, "Turkey Wings" and "Turkey" should not be merged together as they are not
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different parts of the same animal and
  have different nutritional profiles. "Turkey Wings" specifically refers to the wings
  of the turkey, while "Turkey" refers to the entire bird. Although both are poultry-derived
  food, they should be considered as separate entities in a dietician's classification.
