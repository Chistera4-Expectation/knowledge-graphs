text: ' No. French dressing and Honey Lime dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. While they may both be types of dressings, they have distinct ingredients
  and flavors. French dressing typically contains vinegar, oil, sugar, and various
  spices, while Honey Lime dressing is made with honey, lime juice, oil, and vinegar.
  Therefore, they should not be merged.'
