text: No, the instances 'Maitake Mushroom' and 'Shiitake Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different nutritional profiles, flavors, and culinary
  uses. Maitake mushrooms (Grifola frondosa) are known for their immune-boosting properties
  and have a rich, earthy flavor, while Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes) are
  known for their high levels of vitamin D and have a meaty texture and savory flavor.
  Merging them would overlook these important differences.
