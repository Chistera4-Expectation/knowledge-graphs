text: ' No. Alfalfa honey and heather honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of honey. They come from different plant sources (alfalfa
  flowers vs heather plants) and have distinct characteristics such as flavor, color,
  and composition. Therefore, they should remain separate instances within the "Honey"
  class.'
