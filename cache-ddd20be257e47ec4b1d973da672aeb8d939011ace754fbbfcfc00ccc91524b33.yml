text: "As a dietician, my primary focus is on nutrition and health, not specifically\
  \ on classifying food items. However, in terms of the classification of butter,\
  \ 'A2 Butter' and 'European-style Butter' may not be considered semantic and ontological\
  \ duplicates. \n\n'A2 Butter' is a type of butter that comes from cows that produce\
  \ milk with A2 beta-casein protein, which some people believe is easier to digest\
  \ and causes fewer allergic reactions. 'European-style Butter', on the other hand,\
  \ typically refers to butter that has a higher fat content (usually around 82-86%)\
  \ compared to the standard American butter (around 80% fat). \n\nWhile both types\
  \ of butter are made from milk, they are distinguished by their unique characteristics\
  \ and properties. Therefore, it would not be accurate to merge them as semantic\
  \ and ontological duplicates."
