text: No, Alkaline Water and Rain Water should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of water with distinct properties
  and uses. Alkaline water has a higher pH level than regular drinking water, while
  rainwater is collected directly from precipitation and may contain various impurities
  depending on its source.
