  semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct sauces with different ingredients,
  flavors, and cultural origins. Chimichurri sauce is an Argentinean sauce made from
  parsley, garlic, olive oil, and vinegar, while Hoisin sauce is a Chinese sauce made
  from soybeans, garlic, chili peppers, and other spices.
