text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from duck,
  they are distinct food items with different preparation methods and nutritional
  profiles. Duck gravy is a liquid sauce, while duck meatballs are a solid, spherical
  dish. Merging them together would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived
  food options.
