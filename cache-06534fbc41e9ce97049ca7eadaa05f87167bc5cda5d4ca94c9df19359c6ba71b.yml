text: As a dietician, my answer is no. While both Juice and Vegetable Juice can be
  considered as types of liquid refreshments, they are not necessarily semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Juice typically refers to the liquid extracted from fruits,
  while Vegetable Juice refers to the liquid extracted from vegetables. Although both
  can be classified as beverages, they have distinct differences in nutritional content,
  taste, and preparation methods. Therefore, they should not be merged together as
  duplicates.
