text: As a dietician, I would say no. Although both Lavender Honey and Sage Honey
  are types of honey, they are distinct varieties with unique flavors and properties
  due to the different plants they are derived from (lavender and sage, respectively).
  Merging them as duplicates would not accurately represent their differences and
  unique characteristics.
