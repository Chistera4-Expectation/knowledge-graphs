text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are types of milk, they
  are distinct and have different nutritional profiles and properties. Almond milk
  is a plant-based milk alternative made from almonds and water, while cow's milk
  is an animal-based product. They serve different purposes and cater to different
  dietary needs and preferences.
