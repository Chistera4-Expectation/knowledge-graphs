  While garlic powder and bouillon powder are both types of food seasonings, they
  have different ingredients, uses, and flavor profiles. Garlic powder is made from
  dehydrated ground garlic cloves and is used to add garlic flavor to dishes, while
  bouillon powder typically contains meat or vegetable extracts along with various
  herbs and spices, and it is often used as a base for soups, stews, and sauces. Therefore,
  these two instances cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.'
