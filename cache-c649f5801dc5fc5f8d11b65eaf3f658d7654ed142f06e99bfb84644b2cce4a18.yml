text: No, "Chicken Feet" and "Chicken Stock" should not be merged together as they
  are distinct food items. Chicken Feet are a specific part of the chicken used in
  some cuisines, while Chicken Stock is a liquid made by simmering chicken bones,
  meat, and vegetables to create a flavorful base for soups, sauces, and other dishes.
  Although both are derived from chickens, they serve different culinary purposes
  and are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
