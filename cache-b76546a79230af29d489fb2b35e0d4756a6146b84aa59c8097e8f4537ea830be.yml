  The quantity of juice in a container (e.g., 16 oz) is a fact about the amount of
  juice it contains, while "lime juice" refers to the type of juice. These two concepts
  are not duplicates, either semantically or ontologically, because they represent
  different aspects of the juice: its volume vs. its flavor. It would not be appropriate
  to merge them into a single concept.'
