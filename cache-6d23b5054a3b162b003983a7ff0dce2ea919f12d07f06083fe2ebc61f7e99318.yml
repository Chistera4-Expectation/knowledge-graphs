  While both pork belly and roasted pork come from the same animal source (pig), they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to different cuts
  of meat that undergo distinct preparation processes.


  * Pork belly is a specific cut of meat taken from the belly of the pig, often featuring
  alternating layers of fat and lean meat. It can be prepared in various ways but
  has its unique characteristics regardless of cooking method.

  * Roasted pork refers to any pork dish cooked by dry heat in an oven or on a spit,
  including those made from other cuts like tenderloin, loin chops, or shoulder. The
  term "roasted pork" focuses more on the cooking technique than the specific cut
  used.


  Merging these terms would result in loss of important distinctions related to their
  meaning and properties.'
