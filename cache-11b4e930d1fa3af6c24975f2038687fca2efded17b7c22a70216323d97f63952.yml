text: No, Pomegranate Seeds and Watermelon Seeds should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both seeds and edible, they belong to
  different fruit species and have distinct nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and
  cultural significance. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics
  of each seed type.
