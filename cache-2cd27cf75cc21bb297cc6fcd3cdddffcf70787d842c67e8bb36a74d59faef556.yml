  While both Caesar Dressing and Lemon Herb Dressing are types of salad dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients and flavors that make them unique. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. By keeping them separate, we can accurately represent their differences
  and provide more specific information about each type of dressing.'
