  While both cooked white rice and rice flour come from the same source (rice), they
  are not semantic nor ontological duplicates because they have different culinary
  uses and nutritional profiles due to their varying preparation methods. Cooked white
  rice is a starchy grain that can be consumed on its own or used as an ingredient
  in various dishes, while rice flour is a finely ground powder made from milling
  rice grains, often utilized for gluten-free baking and cooking purposes. Merging
  them would result in loss of essential information regarding their distinct applications
  and properties.'
