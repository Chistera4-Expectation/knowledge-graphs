text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food. Pheasant Nuggets are a type of processed food, typically made from ground
  pheasant meat, while Pheasant Stock is a liquid ingredient derived from simmering
  pheasant bones, meat, and vegetables. Although both are derived from pheasant, they
  serve different culinary purposes and should remain separate in a classification
  system.
