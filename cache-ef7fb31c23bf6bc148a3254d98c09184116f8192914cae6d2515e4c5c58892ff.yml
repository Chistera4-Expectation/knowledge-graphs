text: No, Arborio Rice and Long-grain Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of rice, they have different
  properties, uses, and textures. Arborio rice is a short-grain rice with a high starch
  content, making it ideal for risotto, while long-grain rice is a type of rice with
  a lower starch content and a fluffy texture, making it suitable for dishes like
  pilaf and curries.
