text: ' The most adequate class for ''Flour'' would be ''Grain Products'', as flour
  is typically made from grains such as wheat, rice, or corn. However, since this
  category is not provided in the list you have given me, I would suggest that the
  most appropriate class for flour would be ''Carbohydrates'' or ''Starchy Foods''.
  This is because flour is primarily composed of carbohydrates and is used to make
  many staple foods like bread, pasta, and baked goods.'
