text: As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspect of water
  but not on the technicalities of semantic and ontologic duplicates. However, from
  a nutritional standpoint, both oxygenated water and purified water can be considered
  similar in terms of providing hydration and essential minerals. Yet, they may have
  differences in their production processes and potential health benefits. Therefore,
  it's essential to consult an expert in semantic and ontologic analysis to determine
  whether they should be merged in that context.
