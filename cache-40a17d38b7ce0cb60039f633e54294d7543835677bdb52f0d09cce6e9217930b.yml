  Monk fruit extract is a type of natural low-calorie sweetener, but it is not the
  same as other natural sweeteners like honey. Monk fruit extract is much sweeter
  than sugar and has zero calories, whereas honey contains about 64 calories per tablespoon.
  Additionally, monk fruit extract does not raise blood sugar levels, while honey
  can have an impact on blood glucose levels due to its fructose content. Therefore,
  merging these two instances would not accurately reflect their distinct differences.'
