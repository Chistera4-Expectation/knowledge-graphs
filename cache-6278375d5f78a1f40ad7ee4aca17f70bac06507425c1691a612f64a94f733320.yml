text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics and flavors due to the different nectar sources of the honeybees.
  Orange Blossom Honey is derived from the nectar of orange blossoms, while Sourwood
  Honey comes from the nectar of sourwood trees. Merging them would erase these important
  differences.
