text: No, Challah Bread and Grilled Bread should not be merged together as they are
  different types of bread. Challah Bread is a traditional Jewish braided bread, while
  Grilled Bread refers to bread that has been toasted or grilled. They have distinct
  characteristics and uses, so they should remain separate instances in the Bread
  class.
