text: No, the 'King Oyster Mushroom' and 'Lion's Mane Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, nutritional profiles,
  and culinary uses. The King Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus eryngii) is a large, firm
  mushroom with a meaty texture, while the Lion's Mane Mushroom (Hericium erinaceus)
  has a unique appearance with long, shaggy spines and a flavor resembling seafood.
