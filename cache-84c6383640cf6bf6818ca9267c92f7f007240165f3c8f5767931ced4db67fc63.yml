  While "cooked rice" and "white rice" are related, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Cooked rice refers to rice that has been boiled or steamed until it
  becomes soft and edible, while white rice is a type of unprocessed rice that has
  had its husk, bran, and germ removed, leaving just the starchy endosperm. Therefore,
  cooked rice can be made from various types of rice, including white rice. Merging
  them would result in loss of important distinctions between different kinds of rice
  and their preparation methods.'
