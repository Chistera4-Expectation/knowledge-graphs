text: No, 'Chicken Patties' and 'chicken/vegetable stock' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both items are derived from poultry,
  they represent different food categories and are used in different ways in cooking.
  Chicken Patties are a specific type of prepared meat product, while chicken/vegetable
  stock is a liquid base made from simmering chicken and vegetables, which is used
  to add flavor to various dishes.
