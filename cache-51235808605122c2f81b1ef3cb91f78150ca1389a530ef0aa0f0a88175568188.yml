  Glacier Water and Soft Water are distinct types of drinking water with different
  properties and origins. Glacier Water refers to water sourced from glaciers, while
  Soft Water refers to water with low mineral content, typically from a water softener
  system. Merging them together would not accurately represent the differences between
  these types of water.
