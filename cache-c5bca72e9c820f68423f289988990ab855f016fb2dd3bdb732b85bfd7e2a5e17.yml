text: No, Almond Oil and Palm Oil should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are distinct types of edible vegetable oils with different properties,
  nutritional profiles, and uses. Almond Oil is derived from almonds and is often
  used in cosmetics and as a cooking oil, while Palm Oil is derived from the fruit
  of oil palms and is commonly used in food products, cosmetics, and biofuel production.
