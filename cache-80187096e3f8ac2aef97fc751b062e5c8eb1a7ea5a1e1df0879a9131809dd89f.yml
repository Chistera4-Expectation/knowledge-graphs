text: No, the instances 'Ciabatta Bread' and 'Rye Bread' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the broader
  category of bread, they are distinct types of bread with different ingredients,
  textures, and flavors. Merging them would not accurately represent their unique
  characteristics.
