  While grape seeds and pomegranate seeds are both types of edible seeds, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates because they come from different sources
  (grapes vs. pomegranates) and have distinct nutritional profiles and uses. Therefore,
  it is important to maintain them as separate entities in an Edible Seeds class.'
