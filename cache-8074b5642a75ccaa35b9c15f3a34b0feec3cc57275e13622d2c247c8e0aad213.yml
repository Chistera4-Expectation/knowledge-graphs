  While both "additional seasonings" and "adobo seasoning" may involve adding flavor
  to food, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. "Additional seasonings"
  is a general term that can refer to any number of spices, herbs, or other ingredients
  used to enhance the taste of food, while "adobo seasoning" refers specifically to
  a blend of spices commonly used in certain cuisines, such as Mexican or Filipino.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
