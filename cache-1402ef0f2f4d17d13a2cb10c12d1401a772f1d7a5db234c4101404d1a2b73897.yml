text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both instances involve water,
  they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Spring-fed water
  is a specific type of water source, while water for egg wash is used for a culinary
  application. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between
  the two instances.
