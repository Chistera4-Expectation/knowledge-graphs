text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both instances are derived from quails, they represent different food products -
  one is a specific part of the quail (gizzards), and the other is a dish prepared
  from quail (soup). They have distinct properties, uses, and nutritional profiles.
