text: As a dietician, my opinion is that 'Vegetable Broth' and 'Vegetable Stock' are
  not semantic and ontologic duplicates, but they are closely related and can be considered
  synonyms in certain contexts. They both refer to liquid extracted from vegetables,
  used as a base for soups, sauces, and other dishes. However, they might have slight
  differences in preparation, ingredients, and usage in recipes. Therefore, it would
  be better to keep them as separate instances and provide clear distinctions in the
  class.
