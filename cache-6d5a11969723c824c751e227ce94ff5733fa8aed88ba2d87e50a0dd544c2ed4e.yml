text: " No. Thinly sliced meat and thigh meat are not semantic and ontological duplicates\
  \ and should not be merged together. They refer to different types of poultry cuts:\
  \ thinly sliced meat refers to any type of meat that has been cut into thin slices,\
  \ while thigh meat specifically refers to the meat from the upper part of a bird\u2019\
  s leg. Therefore, they have distinct meanings and uses in culinary contexts."
