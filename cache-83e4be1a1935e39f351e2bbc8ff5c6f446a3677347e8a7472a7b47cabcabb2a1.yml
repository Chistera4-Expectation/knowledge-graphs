  ''Old Bay seasoning'' refers to a specific blend of spices and herbs that is commonly
  used in seafood dishes, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay region. It has a distinct
  flavor profile that is different from other seasoning blends.


  ''Seasonings'', on the other hand, is a more general term that can refer to any
  mixture of spices, herbs, and other ingredients used to add flavor to food. It does
  not have a fixed composition or flavor profile like Old Bay seasoning.


  Therefore, they are not semantic and ontological duplicates, and should not be merged.'
