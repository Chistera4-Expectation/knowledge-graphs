text: ' No. Corn syrup and maple syrup are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  despite both being types of sweeteners. They have different nutritional profiles,
  come from different sources (corn vs. maple trees), and have distinct tastes and
  uses in cooking and baking. Therefore, they should be kept as separate instances.'
