text: No, Flaxseed Oil and Palm Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  characteristics, properties, and uses. Flaxseed Oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids,
  while Palm Oil is high in saturated fats. Merging them would not accurately represent
  their unique qualities and uses in the context of dietary advice and food preparation.
