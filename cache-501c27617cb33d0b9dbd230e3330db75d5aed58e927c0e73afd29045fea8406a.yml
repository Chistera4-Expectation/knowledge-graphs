text: No, Nut Milk and Soy Milk should not be merged as they are different types of
  milk, with different nutritional profiles and origins. Nut Milk refers to milk made
  from nuts, such as almond milk or cashew milk, while Soy Milk is made from soybeans.
  While they are both plant-based milk alternatives, they have distinct differences
  in terms of taste, texture, and nutritional content.
