  The term "vegetables" refers to a broad category of plant-based foods, while "bacon
  bits" are a specific type of processed meat product. Dicing vegetables and adding
  them to a dish does not change their fundamental nature as vegetables. Therefore,
  these two instances should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
