text: No, Eucalyptus Honey and Wildflower Honey should not be merged as they are two
  distinct types of honey with different properties and flavors, depending on the
  floral sources from which the honeybees collect nectar. They may share some common
  characteristics as honey, but they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
