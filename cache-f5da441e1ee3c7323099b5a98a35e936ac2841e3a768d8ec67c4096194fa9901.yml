text: No, Red chili peppers and Scotch Bonnet Peppers should not be merged together
  as they are different varieties of chili peppers with distinct characteristics,
  such as heat levels and flavor profiles. While they may both be classified under
  the Spice class, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
