  While peanut oil and safflower oil can both be classified under the broader category
  of "edible vegetable oils," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  come from different plants (peanuts vs. safflowers) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles, flavors, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to maintain these
  separate identities within the edible vegetable oil class.'
