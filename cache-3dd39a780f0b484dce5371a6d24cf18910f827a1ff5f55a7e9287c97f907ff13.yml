text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are edible vegetal oils,
  they come from different sources and have different characteristics, nutritional
  profiles, and uses. Apricot Kernel Oil is extracted from the kernels of the apricot
  fruit, while Palm Oil is derived from the fruit of the oil palm tree. Merging them
  together would not accurately represent their distinct properties and uses.
