text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both instances refer to sauces, they are not the same thing. 'Mustard sauce' is
  a specific type of sauce, while 'Sauce' is a more general term that encompasses
  various types of sauces. Merging them would result in a loss of distinction and
  information.
