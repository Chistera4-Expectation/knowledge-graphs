text: No, Portobello and Reishi mushrooms should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they both belong to the class of edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different nutritional profiles and uses in cuisine
  and medicine. Portobello mushrooms are large, mature cremini mushrooms with a meaty
  texture, while Reishi mushrooms are a medicinal mushroom with a woody texture and
  are not typically used for culinary purposes.
