text: No, Hemp Seed Oil and Pistachio Oil should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of edible vegetable oils with different nutritional profiles, uses,
  and characteristics. Although they share some similarities as plant-based oils,
  they have unique properties and should be treated as separate entities in a class
  on edible vegetal oils.
