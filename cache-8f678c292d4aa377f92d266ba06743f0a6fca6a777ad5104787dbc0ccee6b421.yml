  The amount of protein in a juice per serving is a factual value that can vary between
  different types of juices, while "lime juice" refers to a specific type of fruit
  juice. These two concepts are not duplicates; they represent distinct pieces of
  information related to juice. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them
  as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
