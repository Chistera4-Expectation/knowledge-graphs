text: ' No. Chili oil and coconut oil are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they are both oils that can be used for cooking and flavoring food, chili
  oil is made from infusing hot peppers into another oil (such as sesame or vegetable
  oil), while coconut oil is extracted directly from the flesh of coconuts. They have
  different flavors, nutritional profiles, and uses, so it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as duplicates.'
