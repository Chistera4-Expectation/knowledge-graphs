text: As a dietician, I would suggest that 'Alfredo sauce' and 'Tomato sauce' should
  not be merged together as they have distinct ingredients, nutritional profiles,
  and uses in cooking. While they may both be considered sauces, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates due to their differences.
