text: ' The most adequate class for "thickeners" would be "Sauce." Thickeners are
  often used in sauces to give them a thicker and creamier consistency. While they
  can also be found in other food categories like dressings, seasonings, and sweeteners,
  the category of sauce is most closely associated with thickening agents. Examples
  of common thickeners used in sauces include cornstarch, flour, arrowroot powder,
  and xanthan gum.'
