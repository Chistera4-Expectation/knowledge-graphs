text: No, Pu-erh Tea and Rooibos Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of tea, they have distinct characteristics,
  origins, and health benefits. Pu-erh Tea is a fermented tea from China, while Rooibos
  Tea is an herbal tea from South Africa. They should be treated as separate instances
  within the Tea class.
