text: No, they should not be merged. While both are sauces, they have distinct properties,
  flavors, and uses. Tomato sauce is made from tomatoes, while sour sauce is typically
  made from vinegar or citrus juice. Merging them would not accurately represent the
  variety of sauces available and their unique characteristics.
