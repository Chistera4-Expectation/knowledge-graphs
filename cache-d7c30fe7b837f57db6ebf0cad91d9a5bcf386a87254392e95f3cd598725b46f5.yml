text: No, Duck Liver and Turkey Liver should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the Poultry-derived Food class
  and are liver products, they are derived from different species of birds and can
  have different nutritional profiles, taste, and culinary uses. They should be considered
  distinct entities in the context of a food ontology.
