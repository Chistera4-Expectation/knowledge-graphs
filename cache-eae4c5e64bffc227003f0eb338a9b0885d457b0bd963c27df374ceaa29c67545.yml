text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. While these two sauces may have some
  similarities, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Tempura Dipping Sauce
  is typically a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, and dashi, with grated daikon and sometimes
  garnished with grated ginger, while Sour Sauce usually consists of vinegar, sugar,
  and various spices and can be used in different cuisines. Therefore, they serve
  different purposes and have distinct ingredients.
