text: No, Kefir Yogurt and Skyr Yogurt should not be merged together as they have
  distinct characteristics and are different types of yogurt. Kefir Yogurt is made
  with kefir grains and has a tart, effervescent flavor, while Skyr Yogurt is an Icelandic
  yogurt made with skim milk and has a thicker consistency.
