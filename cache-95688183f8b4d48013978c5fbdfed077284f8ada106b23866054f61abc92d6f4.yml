text: As a dietician, I would recommend merging 'Beef' and 'beef patties' as semantic
  and ontological duplicates, as they both refer to the same type of meat, just in
  different forms. However, it is essential to distinguish between the two in terms
  of nutritional content and preparation methods, as they may have differences in
  their final nutritional values.
