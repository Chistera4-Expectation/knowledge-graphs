text: ' No, apple seeds and poppy seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are small seed-like objects that can come
  from fruits or plants, they have different nutritional profiles, uses, and safety
  considerations. Apple seeds contain a compound called amygdalin, which can release
  cyanide when metabolized, but the amount is generally harmless unless consumed in
  large quantities. Poppy seeds, on the other hand, do not contain any toxic compounds
  and are often used as a culinary ingredient for their flavor and texture. Therefore,
  it is important to maintain separate categories for these two types of seeds to
  accurately reflect their distinct characteristics and properties.'
