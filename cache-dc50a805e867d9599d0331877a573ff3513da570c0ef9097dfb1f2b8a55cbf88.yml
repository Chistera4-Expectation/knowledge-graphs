text: ' No. Balsamic vinegar dressing and lemon juice dressing are not semantic or
  ontologic duplicates. Although both can be used as dressings, they have distinct
  ingredients and characteristics. Balsamic vinegar dressing is made primarily with
  balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and various seasonings, while lemon juice dressing
  is made mainly from fresh lemon juice, often combined with oil, herbs, and spices.'
