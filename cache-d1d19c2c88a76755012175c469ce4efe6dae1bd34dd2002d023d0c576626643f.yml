text: No, Alkaline Water and Infused Water should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they share the property of being a type of drinking water,
  they have distinct characteristics and methods of preparation. Alkaline Water typically
  has a higher pH level due to added minerals, while Infused Water involves adding
  fruits, vegetables, or herbs to enhance flavor and potential health benefits. These
  differences justify their separate classification.
