text: No, 'Mango juice' and 'Orange juice' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are distinct types of juice made from different fruits,
  with different nutritional profiles and flavors. Although both are juices, they
  have unique characteristics that warrant them being separate instances.
