text: No, Pheasant Broth and Pheasant Stock are not exact duplicates. Although they
  have similarities, they have distinct differences. Pheasant Broth typically refers
  to a soup made from pheasant meat and other ingredients, while Pheasant Stock is
  a flavorful liquid obtained by simmering pheasant bones, meat, and aromatics, which
  is used as a base for soups, sauces, and other dishes. The two may share some ingredients
  and preparation methods, but they serve different purposes in cooking.
