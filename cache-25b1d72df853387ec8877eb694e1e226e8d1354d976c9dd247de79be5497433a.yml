text: No, Turkey Gravy and Turkey Liver should not be merged as they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional profiles and uses. Turkey Gravy is a liquid
  sauce made from turkey drippings, while Turkey Liver is a specific organ meat from
  a turkey. They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
