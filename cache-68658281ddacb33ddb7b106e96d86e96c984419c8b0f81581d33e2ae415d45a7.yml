text: No, the instances 'Black Trumpet Mushroom' and 'Enoki Mushroom' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, nutritional profiles,
  and culinary uses. Black Trumpet Mushrooms (Craterellus cornucopioides) are trumpet-shaped
  with a dark, nearly black color, and are often found in wooded areas. Enoki Mushrooms
  (Flammulina velutipes) have small, white caps on long, slender stems and are commonly
  used in Asian cuisine.
