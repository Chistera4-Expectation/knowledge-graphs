text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Alkaline water and soft water are different types of water with distinct properties.
  Alkaline water has a higher pH level, while soft water has a lower concentration
  of minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. These differences make them unique
  and not duplicates of each other.
