text: ' No, Cilantro and Eggplants should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of edible vegetables with different nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and
  growth characteristics. They belong to different botanical families and have unique
  flavor profiles that contribute differently to various dishes. Therefore, it is
  appropriate to keep them separate in terms of semantics and ontology.'
