  While both sodium nitrite and sodium are types of chemicals used for food seasoning
  and preservation, they have distinct properties and roles in food production. Sodium
  (Na) is an alkali metal that serves as a crucial component in various chemical reactions,
  while sodium nitrite (NaNO2) is a specific compound containing nitrogen, oxygen,
  and sodium atoms. They cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they represent different concepts with unique implications for nutrition and health.'
