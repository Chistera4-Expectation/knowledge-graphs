text: No, Alkaline Water and Tap Water should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of drinking water, they have
  distinct properties and characteristics that differentiate them. Alkaline Water
  typically has a higher pH level than regular tap water, which can potentially have
  health benefits for some individuals. Merging these two instances would overlook
  these differences and limit the ability to provide accurate and specific information
  about each type of water.
