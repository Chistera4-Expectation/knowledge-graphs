text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they share the word "sprouts"
  in their names, they are two different types of vegetables. Bean sprouts are the
  germinated seeds of beans, while Brussels sprouts are a type of cabbage grown on
  a stalk. They have different nutritional profiles and culinary uses.
