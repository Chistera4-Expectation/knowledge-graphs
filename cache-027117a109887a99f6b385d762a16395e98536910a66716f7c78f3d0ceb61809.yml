text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from chicken,
  they have distinct differences in nutritional content, preparation methods, and
  culinary uses. 'Boneless chicken' typically refers to the white meat (breast) of
  the chicken, while 'Chicken Thighs' refer to the dark meat (thigh) of the chicken.
  These differences make them separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
