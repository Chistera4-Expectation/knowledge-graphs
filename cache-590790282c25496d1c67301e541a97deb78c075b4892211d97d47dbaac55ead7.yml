text: No, the instances 'Beech Mushroom' and 'Hedgehog Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, appearances, and culinary
  uses. Merging them would result in inaccurate information and negatively impact
  the classification and identification of these mushrooms.
