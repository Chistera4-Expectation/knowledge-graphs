text: ' No. Although fish sauce and oyster sauce are both types of sauces made from
  seafood, they have different ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. Therefore,
  it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Fish
  sauce is typically made by fermenting fish with salt, while oyster sauce is made
  from boiled oysters and seasonings. As such, they have distinct tastes and functions
  in various cuisines around the world.'
