text: 'As a dietician, my answer would be: No, these two types of bread should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates. Grilled bread and pita
  bread are distinct types of bread with different ingredients, preparation methods,
  and nutritional profiles. While they may share some commonalities, they are unique
  enough to warrant separate classifications.'
