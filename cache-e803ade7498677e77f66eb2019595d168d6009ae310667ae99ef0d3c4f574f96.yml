text: No, they should not be merged. While both cream cheese and mascarpone cheese
  are soft, white cheeses, they have distinct differences in taste, texture, and production
  methods. Cream cheese is made from cow's milk and has a tangy flavor, while mascarpone
  is made from cream and has a sweet, buttery flavor. These differences make them
  separate entities in a cheese class.
