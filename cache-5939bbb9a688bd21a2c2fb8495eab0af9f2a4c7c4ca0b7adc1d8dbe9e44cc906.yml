text: No, "Chicken Liver" and "Chicken" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are derived from poultry, they are different
  parts of the chicken and have different nutritional profiles. Chicken liver is richer
  in certain vitamins and minerals, while chicken meat has a different macronutrient
  composition. Therefore, they should be considered as separate entities in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
