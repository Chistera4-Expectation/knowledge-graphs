text: As a dietician, I would recommend not merging the instances 'Guinea Fowl Nuggets'
  and 'Turkey Nuggets' as they are derived from different types of poultry. Although
  they may have similar preparation methods, their nutritional content and taste profiles
  may differ due to the unique characteristics of the respective poultry types. Therefore,
  the answer is no.
