text: No, Olive Oil and Soybean Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of edible vegetable
  oils, they have distinct properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Merging them
  would result in loss of important information and classification.
