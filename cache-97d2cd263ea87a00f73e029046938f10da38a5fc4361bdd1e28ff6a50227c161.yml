text: No, Shiitake mushrooms and Velvet Pioppini mushrooms should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms, they are
  different species with distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and culinary
  uses. Shiitake mushrooms belong to the Lentinula genus, while Velvet Pioppini mushrooms
  belong to the Agrocybe genus. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique
  qualities of each species.
