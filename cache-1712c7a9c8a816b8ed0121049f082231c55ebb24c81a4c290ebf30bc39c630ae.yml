text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Pork Roast' and 'Pork Schnitzel' are derived from pork, they are distinct dishes
  with different preparation methods and textures. Pork Roast is typically a slow-cooked
  cut of meat, while Pork Schnitzel is a thin, breaded cutlet. Merging them as duplicates
  would not accurately represent the differences between the two dishes.
