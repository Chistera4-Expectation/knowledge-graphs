  Artificial sweeteners like saccharin are synthetic sugar substitutes that are significantly
  sweeter than regular sugar but contain few to no calories. Monk fruit extract, on
  the other hand, is a natural low-calorie sweetener derived from the monk fruit (Siraitia
  grosvenorii). It has antioxidant properties and is much sweeter than table sugar,
  but it contains negligible amounts of calories and doesn''t raise blood glucose
  levels. Although both artificial sweeteners and monk fruit extract can serve similar
  purposes by adding sweetness without contributing many calories, they have different
  chemical structures, origins, and potential health effects. Therefore, these two
  concepts should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates in this context.'
