  While both carbohydrates and saturated fats are types of macronutrients found in
  food, they have different effects on health and serve distinct purposes in our diet.
  Carbohydrates provide energy for the body, while saturated fats contribute to energy
  storage and play important roles in cell membrane structure and hormone production.
  Moreover, high intake of saturated fats has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular
  disease due to its effect on cholesterol levels, whereas excessive consumption of
  carbohydrates can lead to weight gain, spikes in blood sugar, and other metabolic
  issues. Therefore, it is essential to track these nutrients separately for proper
  nutrition management and guidance.'
