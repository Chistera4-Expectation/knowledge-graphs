text: ' No. While both French bread and rye bread are types of bread, they have distinct
  characteristics that make them unique from one another. French bread is known for
  its crispy crust and soft interior, while rye bread has a denser texture and distinctive
  flavor due to the use of rye flour. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
