text: No, 'Electrolyte Water' and 'Spring Water' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of drinking water,
  they have different properties and compositions. Electrolyte water contains added
  electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, to help maintain proper fluid balance
  in the body, while spring water is naturally occurring and typically sourced from
  underground springs. These differences in composition and purpose make them distinct
  entities in a drinking water class.
