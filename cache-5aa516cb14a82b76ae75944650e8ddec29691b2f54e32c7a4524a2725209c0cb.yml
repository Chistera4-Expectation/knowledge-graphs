  While chili powder and chili paste are both used to add flavor to food, they have
  different physical properties, uses, and methods of preparation. Chili powder is
  a dry spice made from ground dried chillies, while chili paste is a wet condiment
  typically made by grinding fresh or dried chillies with other ingredients such as
  vinegar, garlic, and oil. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two concepts as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
