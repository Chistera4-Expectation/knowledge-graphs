text: No, Linden Honey and Raw Honey should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Linden Honey refers to a specific type of honey derived
  from the nectar of linden trees, while Raw Honey refers to honey that has not been
  heated or pasteurized, maintaining its natural enzymes and nutrients. These are
  two different types of honey based on their source and processing methods.
