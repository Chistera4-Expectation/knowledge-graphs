  The instances ''Basic Savory Seasonings'' and ''Seasoning'' are not semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They represent different concepts:


  * **Basic Savory Seasonings** is a specific group of seasoning blends used in savory
  dishes, while

  * **Seasoning** is a broader term used to describe any substance used to enhance
  the flavor of food.


  Therefore, they are not duplicates, as they represent different categories of seasoning.'
