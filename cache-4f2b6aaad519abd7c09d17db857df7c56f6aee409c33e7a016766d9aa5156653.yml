  While blue cheese dressing and horseradish dressing may both fall under the category
  of "food dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they
  have distinct ingredients and flavors. Blue cheese dressing is made with blue cheese,
  while horseradish dressing contains horseradish, and these differences result in
  unique tastes and textures that make them separate entities within the food classification
  system. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
