text: No, Ground Pork and Pork Roast should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the Pork-derived Food class,
  they are distinct types of pork products with different preparation methods and
  uses. Ground Pork is finely chopped or minced pork, while Pork Roast refers to a
  cut of pork that is typically roasted whole or in large pieces.
