text: 'As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on the classification of tea, but
  the decision ultimately lies with the developers of the "Tea" class.


  While both Chai Tea and English Breakfast Tea are types of tea, they have distinct
  characteristics, ingredients, and preparation methods. Therefore, they should not
  be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.


  Chai Tea is a spiced tea that typically contains black tea, milk, and a combination
  of spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, and cloves. English Breakfast Tea,
  on the other hand, is a blend of black teas that originated in England and is known
  for its robust flavor.


  Since they have different ingredients and flavor profiles, it is appropriate to
  keep them as separate instances within the "Tea" class.'
