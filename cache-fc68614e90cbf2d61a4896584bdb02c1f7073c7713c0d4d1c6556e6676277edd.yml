  While both "green onions" and "onion" refer to the same plant species (Allium fistulosum),
  they are different in terms of their culinary uses and nutritional profiles. Green
  onions are typically harvested before maturity and have a milder flavor than mature
  onions, while onions are harvested when mature and have a stronger flavor. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate as distinct instances in the Edible Vegetable
  class.'
