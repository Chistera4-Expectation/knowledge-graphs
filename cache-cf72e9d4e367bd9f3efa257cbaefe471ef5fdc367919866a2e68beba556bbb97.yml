text: No, the instances 'Black Trumpet Mushroom' and 'Lion's Mane Mushroom' should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both
  edible mushrooms, they are distinct species with different appearances, tastes,
  and nutritional profiles. Black Trumpet Mushrooms (Craterellus cornucopioides) are
  trumpet-shaped, dark in color, and have a rich, earthy flavor. Lion's Mane Mushrooms
  (Hericium erinaceus) have a shaggy, white appearance and a mild, sweet flavor. Merging
  them together would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each
  species.
