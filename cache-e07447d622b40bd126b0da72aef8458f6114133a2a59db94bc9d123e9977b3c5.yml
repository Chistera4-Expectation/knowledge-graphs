text: No, 'Clover Honey' and 'Raw Honey' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of honey, they differ in their sources and production
  processes. Clover honey is derived from the nectar of clover plants, while raw honey
  is unprocessed and unpasteurized, containing all the natural enzymes and nutrients
  found in honey. They are distinct types of honey with different characteristics
  and properties.
