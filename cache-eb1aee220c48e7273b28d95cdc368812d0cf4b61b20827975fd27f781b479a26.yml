  While both "Mango" and "Mango chutney" are related to mangoes, they represent different
  concepts in the context of food. "Mango" refers to the fruit itself, while "Mango
  chutney" is a condiment made from mangoes. They have different nutritional profiles,
  flavors, textures, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it''s not appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
