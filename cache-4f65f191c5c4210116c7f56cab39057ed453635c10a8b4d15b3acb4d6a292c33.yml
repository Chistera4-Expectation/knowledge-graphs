  While peanuts and peanut butter are related, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Peanuts are a type of edible seed that can be eaten raw, roasted, or
  used to make various foods such as oils and butters. On the other hand, peanut butter
  is a specific food product made by grinding peanuts into a smooth paste. Therefore,
  they have distinct properties and uses, making them separate entities in both semantics
  and ontology.'
