  Alfalfa honey and comb honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates and should
  not be merged together as they refer to different types of honey products. Alfalfa
  honey is a type of honey made from nectar collected by bees from alfalfa flowers,
  while comb honey refers to sections of the hexagonal-shaped beeswax cells that contain
  raw honey inside the beehive. They have distinct characteristics and uses, so it
  would not be appropriate to merge them into one category.'
