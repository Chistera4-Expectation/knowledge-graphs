text: No, 'Hard Water' and 'Mineral Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both types of water contain minerals, they differ
  in their hardness and origin. Hard water has a high concentration of minerals like
  calcium and magnesium, while mineral water is naturally infused with minerals and
  can be sourced from a spring or well. They serve different purposes and have distinct
  properties, making them separate entities in the context of drinking water.
