text: As a dietician, my focus is on nutrition rather than linguistic semantics and
  ontology. However, in terms of nutrition, fresh noodles and noodles can refer to
  different types of pasta, which may have varying nutritional values. For example,
  fresh noodles may contain more moisture and be less processed than dried noodles.
  Thus, merging them as semantic and ontologic duplicates might not be accurate from
  a nutritional perspective.
