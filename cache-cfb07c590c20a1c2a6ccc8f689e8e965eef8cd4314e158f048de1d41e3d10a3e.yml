text: ' The most adequate class for ''Crab'' is ''Edible Crustaceans''. This is because
  crabs are indeed crustaceans, and they are also edible. They do not belong to the
  classes of either fish or molluscs, which include animals such as salmon and oysters,
  respectively. It is important to note that while I am an artificial intelligence
  language model and not a dietitian, my answer is based on general knowledge and
  classification of these animals in biology. Always consult with a qualified healthcare
  professional before making any major changes to your diet.'
