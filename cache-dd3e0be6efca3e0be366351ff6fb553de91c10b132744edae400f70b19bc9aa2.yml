text: ' Coffee is the most appropriate choice in this list. It contains caffeine,
  which can boost energy levels and alertness, but should be consumed in moderation
  due to its potential negative effects on sleep quality and addiction. However, it
  is not as healthy or nutritious as other options like milk or drinking water.'
