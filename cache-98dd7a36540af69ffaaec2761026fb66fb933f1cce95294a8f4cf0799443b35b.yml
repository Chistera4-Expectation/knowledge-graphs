text: 'No, the instances ''Flavored Butter'' and ''Whipped Butter'' should not be
  merged together as they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. While both are
  types of butter, they have different characteristics and uses:


  1. Flavored Butter: This type of butter is infused with various flavors, such as
  garlic, herbs, or sweeteners. It is commonly used as a spread, topping, or ingredient
  in dishes to enhance flavor.


  2. Whipped Butter: This type of butter is whipped to incorporate air, resulting
  in a lighter, fluffier texture. It is typically used for spreading on bread, pastries,
  or as a topping for dishes like mashed potatoes or vegetables.


  Although both are types of butter, they are distinct in their flavor and texture,
  making them separate entities in terms of semantics and ontology.'
