text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'Butter Blend' and 'Lactose-free
  Butter' are types of butter, they have different compositions and properties. 'Butter
  Blend' typically contains a mix of butter and other fats, while 'Lactose-free Butter'
  is made from butter with lactose removed to accommodate individuals with lactose
  intolerance. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics
  and uses of each type of butter.
