text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of yogurt with
  distinct characteristics and uses. Drinkable yogurt is a liquid or smoothie-like
  yogurt, while savory yogurt is a type of yogurt that is flavored with savory ingredients
  and used in savory dishes. They serve different purposes and have different nutritional
  profiles.
