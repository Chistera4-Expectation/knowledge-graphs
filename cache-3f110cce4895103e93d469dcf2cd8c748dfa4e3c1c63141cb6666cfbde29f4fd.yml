text: No, 'Guinea Fowl Eggs' and 'Ostrich Eggs' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they both belong to the Poultry-derived Food class,
  they are derived from different species of birds and have different nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, they should be treated as distinct instances within the class.
