  While both "optional ingredients" and "optional seasonings" may seem similar, they
  serve different purposes in the context of a food seasoning class from a dietary
  perspective. Optional ingredients refer to any additional components that can be
  added to a dish, while optional seasonings specifically relate to flavor enhancers.
  Therefore, it is beneficial to keep them separate for clarity and specificity.'
