  While both are poultry-derived food items made from pheasant, they have distinct
  culinary preparations and uses. Pheasant gravy is a sauce typically used to accompany
  or flavor other dishes, while pheasant patties are a standalone food item, often
  in the form of ground or minced pheasant meat shaped into patties. The differences
  in preparation and usage warrant separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food
  class.
