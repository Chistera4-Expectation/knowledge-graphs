  While black pepper and white pepper come from the same plant (Piper nigrum), they
  are different parts of the plant and have different flavor profiles, aroma, and
  uses in cooking. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. It is essential to maintain their distinct identities when
  considering nutritional information and culinary applications.'
