text: No, Broccoli and Chinese Broccoli should not be merged together as they are
  different vegetables with distinct characteristics. While they both belong to the
  Brassica family and share similarities in appearance, they have different nutritional
  profiles, tastes, and textures. Merging them would not accurately represent their
  unique properties.
