text: No, Turkey Drumsticks and Turkey Thighs should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they both come from turkey, they are distinct
  cuts of meat with different nutritional profiles, preparation methods, and cooking
  times. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
