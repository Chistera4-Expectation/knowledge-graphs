text: No, Hazelnut Oil and Safflower Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they come from
  different plant sources, have different nutritional profiles, and are used in different
  culinary applications. They should be treated as separate entities within the class.
