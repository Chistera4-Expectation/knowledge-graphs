text: No, Flavored Water and Mineral Water should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they have distinct characteristics
  and compositions. Flavored Water typically contains added flavors and may have additional
  ingredients like sweeteners, while Mineral Water contains naturally occurring minerals
  and is sourced from a mineral spring.
