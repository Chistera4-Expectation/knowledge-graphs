text: No, they should not be merged together as they are distinct food items derived
  from quails. Quail eggs are the eggs of quails, while quail nuggets are typically
  pieces of quail meat, often breaded and fried. Although both are derived from quails,
  they are different food items with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking.
