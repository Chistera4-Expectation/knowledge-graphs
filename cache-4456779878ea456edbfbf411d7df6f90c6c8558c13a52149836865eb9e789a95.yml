  semantic and ontological duplicates. They are different types of spices with distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and heat levels. Scotch Bonnet Peppers are a variety of
  chili pepper with a fruity flavor and very high heat level, while White Pepper is
  a milder spice derived from the dried, unripe berries of the Piper nigrum plant.
  They serve different purposes in cooking and have unique properties.
