  The two teas have different ingredients and nutritional profiles, so they should
  not be considered duplicates. Berry Bliss tea contains a blend of fruit juices and
  herbs, while Green tea is made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. They
  may share some similarities in terms of their potential health benefits, but they
  are distinct products with unique characteristics.'
