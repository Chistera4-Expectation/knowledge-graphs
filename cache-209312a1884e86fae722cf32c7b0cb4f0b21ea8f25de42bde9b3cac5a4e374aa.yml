text: No, they should not be merged as they have different ingredients, flavors, and
  uses in cooking. Hot sauce is typically made from chili peppers and vinegar, while
  Worcestershire sauce contains anchovies, molasses, and tamarind, among other ingredients.
  They serve different purposes in seasoning food and are not considered duplicates
  in terms of semantics or ontology.
