text: No, Dungeness Crab and Horseshoe Crab should not be merged together as they
  are distinct species with different characteristics, habitats, and uses in the context
  of edible crustaceans. Dungeness Crab is a true crab, while Horseshoe Crab is more
  closely related to spiders and scorpions than to crabs. Additionally, Horseshoe
  Crab is not typically consumed as food.
