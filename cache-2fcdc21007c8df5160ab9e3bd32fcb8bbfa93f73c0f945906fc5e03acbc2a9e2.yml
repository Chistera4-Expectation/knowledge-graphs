  While both "Calcium content per serving" and "Calories per serving" are related
  to nutrition, they measure different things and should not be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Calcium content measures the amount of calcium present
  in a given serving size, while calories per serving refers to the amount of energy
  contained within that same serving size. These two properties provide distinct information
  about the cheese being described.'
