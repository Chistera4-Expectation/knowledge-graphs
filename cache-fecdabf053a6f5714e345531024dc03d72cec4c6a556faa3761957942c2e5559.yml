  In this context, ''the type of juice'' refers to the category or classification
  of juice (e.g., orange juice, apple juice), while ''Juice'' is a more general term
  that encompasses all types of juices. Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates and do not need to be merged together.'
