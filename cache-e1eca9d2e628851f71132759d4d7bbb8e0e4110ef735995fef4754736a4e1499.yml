  The two instances, "Chicken breast" and "Chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces,"
  are not exact duplicates. The second instance is a modified version of the first,
  with the additional step of cutting the chicken breast into smaller pieces. While
  they share similar nutritional properties, they have different textures and preparation
  methods, making them distinct entities in the context of poultry-derived foods.
  Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate rather than merging them as duplicates.'
