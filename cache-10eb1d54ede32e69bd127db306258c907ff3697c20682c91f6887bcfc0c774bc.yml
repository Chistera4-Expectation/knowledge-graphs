text: No, they should not be merged. Lactose-free milk is made from cow's milk with
  lactase added to break down the lactose, while pea milk is a plant-based milk alternative
  made from yellow peas. They belong to different categories (dairy vs. plant-based)
  and have distinct nutritional profiles.
