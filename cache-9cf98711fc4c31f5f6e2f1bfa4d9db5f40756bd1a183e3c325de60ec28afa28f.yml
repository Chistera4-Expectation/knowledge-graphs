text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Duck Patties" and "Ostrich
  Patties" are poultry-derived foods, they are made from different types of poultry
  and may have distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Therefore, they should
  be kept as separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
