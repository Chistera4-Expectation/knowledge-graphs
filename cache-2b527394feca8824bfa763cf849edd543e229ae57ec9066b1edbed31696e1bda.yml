text: No, "Duck Stock" and "Duck" should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they both involve duck, they are different food items. "Duck"
  refers to the meat of the duck, whereas "Duck Stock" is a liquid made by cooking
  duck bones, connective tissue, and aromatic vegetables to extract their flavors.
  They serve different purposes in cooking and have distinct nutritional profiles.
