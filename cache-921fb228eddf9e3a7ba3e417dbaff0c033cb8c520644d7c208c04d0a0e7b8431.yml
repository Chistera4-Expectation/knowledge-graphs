  While both "cinnamon sticks" and "ground cinnamon" are types of cinnamon, they serve
  different purposes when it comes to cooking and baking, so they cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates. Cinnamon sticks are typically used whole to
  infuse flavor into dishes, while ground cinnamon is more commonly used for its strong
  aroma and ease of incorporation into mixtures. Therefore, these two concepts must
  remain distinct within the context of a food seasoning class.'
