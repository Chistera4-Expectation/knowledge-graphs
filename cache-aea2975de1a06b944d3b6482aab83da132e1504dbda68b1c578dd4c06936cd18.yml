text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'Guinea Fowl Gravy' and
  'Guinea Fowl Stock' are derived from guinea fowl, they are different in terms of
  their preparation, consistency, and culinary use. Gravy is typically thicker and
  richer, while stock is more broth-like and used as a base for soups, sauces, and
  other dishes.
