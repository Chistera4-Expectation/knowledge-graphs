text: No, Chamomile Tea and Mint Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both types of tea, they have distinct properties and
  characteristics, such as flavor, aroma, and potential health benefits. Merging them
  would lose the specificity and nuance of each type of tea.
