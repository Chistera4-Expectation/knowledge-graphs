text: ' "Juice" would be the most appropriate class for "Smoothie." While smoothies
  do share some similarities with other beverages, they are typically made from blended
  fruits and vegetables, which aligns them more closely with juices. Additionally,
  smoothies can often be part of a healthy and balanced diet, much like juice, whereas
  alcoholic drinks, energy drinks, and many coffee and tea beverages may not always
  be the healthiest choices due to added sugars or other unhealthy ingredients.'
