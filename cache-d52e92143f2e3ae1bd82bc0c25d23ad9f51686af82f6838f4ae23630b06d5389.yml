  While "Ethnic Seasoning Blends" and "Seasoning Cubes" may be semantically similar,
  they are not ontologically duplicates.


  * **Semantic Similarity:** Both terms describe seasoning mixtures used in different
  cuisines or dishes. They are semantically similar as they are related to the same
  concept of seasoning.

  * **Ontological Distinctness:** However, they differ ontologically in their specific
  meanings and contexts. "Ethnic Seasoning Blends" specifically refers to blends used
  in ethnic cuisines, while "Seasoning Cubes" are a general category of seasoning
  cubes used in various cuisines.


  Therefore, they should not be merged together as they represent distinct ontological
  categories within the domain of seasoning.'
