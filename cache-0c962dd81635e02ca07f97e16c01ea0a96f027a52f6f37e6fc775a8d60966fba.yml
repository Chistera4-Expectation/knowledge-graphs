text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct characteristics, uses, and flavor
  profiles. Extra virgin olive oil is known for its mild flavor and health benefits,
  while sesame oil is prized for its nutty aroma and flavor. Merging them as duplicates
  would ignore these important differences.
