text: No, "Pheasant Patties" and "Pheasant Stock" should not be merged together as
  they are different poultry-derived food items. Pheasant Patties are a type of meat
  product made from ground pheasant meat, while Pheasant Stock is a liquid made by
  simmering pheasant bones, vegetables, and herbs in water. While they both originate
  from pheasants, they have distinct properties and uses in cooking.
