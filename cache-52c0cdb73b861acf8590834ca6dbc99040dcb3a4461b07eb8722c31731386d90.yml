text: As a dietician, I would recommend treating "Probiotic Yogurt" and "Yogurt" as
  distinct entities, despite their similarities. While they are both types of yogurt,
  they have distinct characteristics and nutritional properties due to the presence
  of probiotics in the former. Therefore, it is essential to keep them separate for
  accurate nutritional information and recommendations. So, the answer is no.
