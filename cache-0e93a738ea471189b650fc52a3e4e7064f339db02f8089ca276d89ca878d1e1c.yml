text: No, Macadamia Nut Oil and Safflower Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they have different
  nutritional profiles, flavors, and uses in cooking and other applications. They
  should remain separate instances in the class.
