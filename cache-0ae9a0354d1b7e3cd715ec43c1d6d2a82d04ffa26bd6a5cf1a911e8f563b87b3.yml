text: No, Greek Yogurt and Probiotic Yogurt should not be merged together as they
  are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of yogurt, they
  have distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. Greek yogurt is strained
  to remove whey, resulting in a thicker, creamier texture and higher protein content.
  Probiotic yogurt contains live and active cultures that can provide health benefits,
  such as improved gut health.
