text: No, Arborio Rice and Sticky Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have different properties and uses
  in cooking. Arborio Rice is an Italian short-grain rice, known for its high starch
  content, which gives it a creamy texture when cooked, making it ideal for risotto.
  Sticky Rice, also known as glutinous rice, is a type of rice that is especially
  sticky when cooked and is commonly used in Asian cuisine, particularly in dishes
  like sushi and sticky rice desserts.
