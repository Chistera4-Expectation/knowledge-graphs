text: No, Quail Eggs and Quail Wings should not be merged together as they are different
  food items derived from quails. Quail Eggs refer to the eggs produced by quails,
  while Quail Wings refer to the wings of quails, which are also consumed as food.
  Both items have distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking.
