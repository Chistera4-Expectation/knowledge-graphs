text: No, Darjeeling Tea and Herbal Tea should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of tea with different characteristics. Darjeeling tea is a black
  tea from the Darjeeling region in India, while herbal tea is a blend of various
  herbs, fruits, or spices and does not contain actual tea leaves. Although they are
  both types of tea, they have different properties and uses.
