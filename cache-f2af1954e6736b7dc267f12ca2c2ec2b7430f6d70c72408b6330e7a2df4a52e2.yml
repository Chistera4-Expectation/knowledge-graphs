text: ' No. While chicken breasts are a type of poultry meat and share many nutritional
  properties with other cuts of chicken, they also have unique characteristics that
  make them distinct from whole chickens. Chicken breasts generally contain less fat
  and calories than a whole chicken, which can impact their use in meal planning and
  nutrition recommendations. Therefore, it is appropriate to maintain separate instances
  for "chicken breasts" and "chicken."'
