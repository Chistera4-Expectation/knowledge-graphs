text: ' No. Mascarpone and mozzarella are two distinct types of cheese that have different
  nutritional profiles, textures, flavors, uses, and origins. Merging them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates would not accurately reflect their unique characteristics.
  While they may both fall under the broader category of "cheese," it is important
  to maintain separate instances for each type in order to provide accurate information
  about their individual properties and attributes.'
