text: ' No. Avocado oil and olive oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they share some similarities as edible vegetable oils. They come from
  different plant sources (avocados vs olives), have distinct nutritional profiles,
  flavors, and uses in cooking and cosmetics. Therefore, it is essential to maintain
  them as separate instances for accurate representation of their unique properties
  and meanings.'
