text: No, Jasmine Rice and White Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both types of white rice, they have distinct properties,
  such as texture, flavor, and starch content, which differentiate them from each
  other. Merging them as duplicates would not accurately represent these differences.
