text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Fish stock" and "Sushi-grade
  fish" are related to fish, they refer to different aspects of edible fish. Fish
  stock refers to a liquid made by simmering fish bones and other ingredients, while
  sushi-grade fish is a specific quality of fish suitable for consumption raw in sushi
  dishes. These two concepts have distinct properties and are not duplicates.
