text: ' The most appropriate category for "Caramelized Crickets" would be under the
  "Insect-Based Snacks or Desserts" section. This is because caramelized crickets
  are made from insects, specifically crickets that have been cooked and coated in
  a sweet caramel sauce, which makes them a unique snack or dessert option.'
