  While both "seasoning cubes" and "taco seasoning" are types of food seasonings,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they serve different purposes
  and contain different ingredients.


  "Seasoning cubes," also known as stock cubes or bouillon cubes, typically consist
  of dehydrated vegetables, meat (in some cases), salt, and flavor enhancers such
  as monosodium glutamate (MSG). They are used to add savory flavors to soups, stews,
  sauces, and other dishes.


  On the other hand, "taco seasoning" is a blend of spices specifically formulated
  for use in Mexican-style tacos, burritos, fajitas, and similar dishes. The typical
  ingredients include chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano,
  and salt. Some brands may also include sugar, cornstarch, or other fillers.


  Given their distinct uses and ingredient profiles, it would not be appropriate to
  merge these two concepts into one category.'
