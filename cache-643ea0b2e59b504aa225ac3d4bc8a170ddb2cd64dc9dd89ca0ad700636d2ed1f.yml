text: No, Roast pork and salt pork should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are derived from pork, they have different preparation
  methods and characteristics. Roast pork is typically seasoned and cooked in an oven,
  while salt pork is cured in salt and has a distinct salty flavor. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the differences between the two.
