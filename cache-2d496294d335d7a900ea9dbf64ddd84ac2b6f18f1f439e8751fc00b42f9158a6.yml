text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different types of rice with
  distinct characteristics. Brown rice refers to rice with the bran layer intact,
  providing a higher nutritional value, while long-grain rice has a slender shape
  and typically cooks up fluffy and separate. These differences make them distinct
  entities in terms of semantics and ontology.
