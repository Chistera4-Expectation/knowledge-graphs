text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates because "Duck
  Drumsticks" and "Quail Drumsticks" are distinct types of poultry-derived food. Although
  they share similarities, such as being drumsticks, they come from different species
  of birds and may have different nutritional profiles, cooking methods, and cultural
  significance.
