  While both honey and Tupelo honey are types of sweeteners derived from natural sources,
  they have distinct differences that warrant them to be treated as separate entities
  rather than merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Honey is a broad category of sweet syrup produced by bees using nectar from flowers
  while Tupelo honey is a specific type of honey with unique characteristics. It comes
  primarily from the white tupelo tree (Nyssa ogeche) found mainly in swamps along
  the coastal areas of Georgia and Florida in the United States. The nectar collected
  from these trees produces a light-colored, delicately flavored honey known for its
  high fructose content and slow crystallization rate. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge ''honey'' and ''tupelo honey'' into one instance due to their
  different properties and origins.'
