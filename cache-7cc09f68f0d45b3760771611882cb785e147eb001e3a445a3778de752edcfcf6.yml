text: No, Chili Powder and chili flakes should not be merged together as they have
  different properties and uses in cooking. Chili Powder is a blend of spices, typically
  including ground chili peppers, cumin, garlic powder, and other seasonings, while
  chili flakes are made from dried, crushed chili peppers. Although both can provide
  heat and flavor to dishes, they are distinct ingredients with different flavor profiles.
