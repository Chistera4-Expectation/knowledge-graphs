text: No, the instances 'French Bread' and 'Gluten-Free Bread' should not be merged
  together as they have distinct characteristics and properties. French Bread typically
  contains gluten, while Gluten-Free Bread does not. Merging them would result in
  a loss of specific information about each type of bread.
