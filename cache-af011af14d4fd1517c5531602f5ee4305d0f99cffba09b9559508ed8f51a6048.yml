text: ' No. Scotch bonnet pepper and white pepper are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, and they should not be merged together. They belong to different categories
  of peppers: Scotch bonnet is a type of hot chili pepper, while white pepper comes
  from the inner seed of certain fruits of the Piper nigrum plant. These two ingredients
  have distinct flavors, appearances, uses, and heat levels on the Scoville scale
  (100,000-350,000 SHU for Scotch bonnets vs. 1,000-10,000 SHU for white pepper).
  Therefore, it is essential to keep them separate when discussing spices and their
  culinary applications.'
