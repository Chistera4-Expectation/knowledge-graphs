  While both "Duck Gizzards" and "Duck Stock" are derived from ducks, they are different
  food items with distinct nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Duck gizzards
  are a specific part of the duck anatomy, while duck stock is a liquid made from
  simmering duck bones, vegetables, and aromatics.
