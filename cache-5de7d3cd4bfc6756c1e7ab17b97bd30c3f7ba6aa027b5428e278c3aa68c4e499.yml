text: ' No, Chia seeds and Pomegranate seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of seeds, they come from different
  plants (Chia seeds coming from Salvia hispanica and Pomegranate seeds from Punica
  granatum) and have distinct nutritional profiles and uses. Therefore, it is important
  to maintain them as separate entities in a classification system for edible seeds.'
