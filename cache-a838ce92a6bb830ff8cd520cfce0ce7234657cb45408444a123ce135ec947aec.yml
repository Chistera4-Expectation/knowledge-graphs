text: No, the instances 'Infused Water' and 'Spring-fed Water' should not be merged
  together as they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Infused Water refers
  to water that has been flavored with fruits, herbs, or other natural ingredients,
  while Spring-fed Water is water that comes from an underground formation where water
  flows naturally to the surface. These two types of water have distinct properties
  and should be kept as separate instances.
