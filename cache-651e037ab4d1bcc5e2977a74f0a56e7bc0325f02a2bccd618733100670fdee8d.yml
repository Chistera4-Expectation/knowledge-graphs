text: 'As a dietician, I can provide insights into the nutritional aspects of these
  teas, but the decision to merge or not merge the instances ''Chai Tea'' and ''White
  Tea'' is more of a classification and ontology question. However, in the context
  of nutrition, these two teas have distinct characteristics:


  1. Chai Tea: A blend of black tea and various spices, such as ginger, cardamom,
  and cinnamon. The spices may provide additional health benefits, and black tea contains
  antioxidants.


  2. White Tea: Made from young or minimally processed tea leaves, white tea is less
  oxidized than black tea and may have a milder taste. It also contains antioxidants,
  but the specific types and amounts may differ from those found in black tea.


  While both teas share some similarities, they have distinct flavors, processing
  methods, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, from a nutritional and classification
  standpoint, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
