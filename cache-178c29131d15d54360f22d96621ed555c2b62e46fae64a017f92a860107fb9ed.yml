  While both "Grain-finished beef" and "Organic beef" refer to types of beef, they
  are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They describe different production
  methods that result in distinct qualities of the final product. Grain-finished beef
  refers to cattle that were fed grain during the finishing phase of their lives,
  while organic beef indicates that the cattle were raised according to specific USDA
  guidelines for organic livestock practices, which cover feed, living conditions,
  and other factors. These two terms represent separate concepts within the domain
  of beef production.'
