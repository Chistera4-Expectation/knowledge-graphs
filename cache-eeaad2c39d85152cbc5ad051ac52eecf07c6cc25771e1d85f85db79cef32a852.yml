text: ' No. While both "Cheese" and "Grated Parmesan cheese" are types of cheese,
  they have distinct characteristics that make them different from one another. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Grated Parmesan cheese is a specific type of cheese that has been grated, whereas
  cheese is a more general category that encompasses many different varieties, including
  but not limited to Parmesan.'
