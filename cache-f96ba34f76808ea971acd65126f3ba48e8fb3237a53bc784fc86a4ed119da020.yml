text: ' No. Although cornbread and rye bread are both types of bread, they have distinct
  ingredients, flavors, textures, and uses in recipes. Cornbread is made primarily
  with cornmeal, while rye bread contains rye flour. These differences result in unique
  nutritional profiles and culinary applications. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates from a dietitian''s perspective.'
