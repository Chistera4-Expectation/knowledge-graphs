text: No, 'Pheasant Stock' and 'Quail Stock' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both derived from poultry and share similar
  properties, they are distinct ingredients made from different types of birds, resulting
  in unique flavors and nutritional profiles. Merging them would lead to a loss of
  specific information and potentially cause confusion for users seeking information
  about these ingredients.
