text: No, the instances 'Mitten Crab' and 'Spider Crab' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible crustaceans, they belong
  to different families (Eriocheiridae for Mitten Crab and Majoidea for Spider Crab)
  and have distinct characteristics and appearances. They should be treated as separate
  entities in a classification system.
