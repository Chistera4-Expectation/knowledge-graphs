text: No, the instances "Mantis Shrimp" and "Unsweetened shrimp flakes" should not
  be merged together as they are distinct edible crustaceans. Mantis Shrimp is a specific
  type of crustacean, while shrimp flakes are a processed product made from shrimp.
  They are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
