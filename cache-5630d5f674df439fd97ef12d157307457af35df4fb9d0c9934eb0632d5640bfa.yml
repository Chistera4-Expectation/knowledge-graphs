text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from Guinea
  Fowl, they are different food items with distinct preparation methods and uses.
  'Guinea Fowl Gravy' is a sauce or liquid condiment, while 'Guinea Fowl Nuggets'
  are bite-sized, fried or baked pieces of Guinea Fowl meat. Merging them would result
  in a loss of specificity and clarity in the classification.
