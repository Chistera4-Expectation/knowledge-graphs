text: ' "Dairy" would be the most appropriate broad class for all of these food items,
  as they are all derived from milk. However, if you specifically want to choose just
  one of those options and exclude the others, I would suggest "Butter." This is because
  butter is often considered less healthy than some other dairy products due to its
  high saturated fat content, so it might make sense to single it out in this way.
  Of course, it''s important to note that even within the category of butter there
  can be significant variation in terms of nutrition depending on factors like whether
  it''s salted or unsalted, made from grass-fed cows, etc., but based solely on the
  options given I would recommend "Butter."'
