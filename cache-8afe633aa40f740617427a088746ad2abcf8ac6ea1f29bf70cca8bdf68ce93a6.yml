text: "No, Pheasant Gizzards and Pheasant Wings should not be merged together as semantic\
  \ and ontologic duplicates. While both are parts of a pheasant, they have different\
  \ nutritional values and culinary uses. Gizzards are typically used in stews, stir-fries,\
  \ and saut\xE9s, while wings are often roasted, grilled, or fried. Therefore, they\
  \ should be kept as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class."
