text: ' No. Basmati rice and white rice are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they may share some similarities. They belong to different categories
  of rice varieties with distinct characteristics such as taste, texture, aroma, and
  nutritional profile. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as separate entities
  for accurate information representation.'
