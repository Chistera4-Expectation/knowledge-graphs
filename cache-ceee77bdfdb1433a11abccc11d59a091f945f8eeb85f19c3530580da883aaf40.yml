  While both Grape Nuts and Honey Nut Cheerios are types of breakfast cereals, they
  have different ingredients, flavors, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, they cannot
  be considered semantic or ontological duplicates that can be merged together. It
  is important to maintain separate categories for these distinct products in order
  to provide accurate information about their individual characteristics and benefits.'
