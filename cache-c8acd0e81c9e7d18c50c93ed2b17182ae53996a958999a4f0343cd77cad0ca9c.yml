  While both avocado dressing and Caesar dressing are types of food dressings, they
  have different ingredients and flavors, so they should not be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates. Avocado dressing is typically made with mashed avocados,
  lemon juice, garlic, and oil, while Caesar dressing usually contains anchovies,
  raw egg yolk, garlic, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, olive oil, and
  Parmesan cheese. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts
  into one.'
