text: ' No. Catfish and raw fish are not semantic and ontological duplicates and should
  not be merged. While catfish is a type of edible fish that can be eaten raw, not
  all raw fish is catfish. Therefore, they refer to distinct concepts and should remain
  separate entities in a classification system for edible fish.'
