  While ranch dressing and tahini dressing can both be classified as food dressings,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantically, they have different
  meanings: ranch dressing is typically a creamy dressing made with mayonnaise or
  sour cream and flavored with herbs and spices, while tahini dressing is a sauce
  made from sesame paste, often used in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine.
  Ontologically, they belong to distinct categories of dressings due to their unique
  ingredients, preparation methods, and uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as duplicates.'
