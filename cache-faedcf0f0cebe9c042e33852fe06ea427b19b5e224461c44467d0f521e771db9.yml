  Although tamarind paste and chili bean paste share some similarities as food seasonings,
  they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates because they have distinct ingredients,
  flavors, uses, and cultural origins. Tamarind paste is made from the pulp of the
  tamarind fruit and has a sour taste, while chili bean paste (also known as doubanjiang)
  is typically made with fermented soybeans and chilies and has a spicy flavor. They
  serve different purposes in cooking and are used in various cuisines worldwide.'
