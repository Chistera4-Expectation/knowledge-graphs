text: ' No. Raspberry honey and Tupelo honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they both belong to the "Honey" class. They differ in their source (the
  type of flower nectar from which they are made) and therefore may have different
  tastes, textures, colors, and nutritional profiles. Merging them would result in
  loss of important distinctions between these two types of honey.'
