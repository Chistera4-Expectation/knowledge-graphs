text: ' The most adequate class for "Seasonings" would be "Food Seasoning". This is
  because seasonings are typically added to food to enhance its flavor, and this category
  includes various herbs, spices, salts, and other condiments used for that purpose.
  Other categories such as "Spice", while related, may not encompass all types of
  seasonings, such as those derived from fruits or vegetables.'
