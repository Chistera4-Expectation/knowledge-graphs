text: No, Duck Stock and Quail Stock should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates, as they are derived from different types of poultry, which could potentially
  result in different nutritional profiles and flavors. While they both fall under
  the Poultry-derived Food class, they are distinct instances within that category.
