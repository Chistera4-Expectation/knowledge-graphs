text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct properties. Turkey nuggets
  and turkey patties are both derived from poultry, but they have different shapes
  and preparations. Turkey nuggets are typically breaded and formed into small pieces,
  while turkey patties are formed into larger, flat shapes, similar to hamburger patties.
  These differences in shape and preparation affect how the foods are consumed and
  their nutritional profiles, making them distinct instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
