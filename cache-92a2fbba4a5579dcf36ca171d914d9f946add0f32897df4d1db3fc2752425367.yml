text: No, they should not be merged. Infused water and oxygenated water are two distinct
  types of water with different properties and preparation methods. Infused water
  is water that has had fruits, vegetables, or herbs steeped in it to add flavor and
  potential health benefits, while oxygenated water involves the process of adding
  oxygen to the water, typically through bubbling or other methods. These are separate
  concepts and should not be merged as semantic or ontological duplicates.
