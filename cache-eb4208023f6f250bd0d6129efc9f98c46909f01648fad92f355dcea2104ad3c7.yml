text: No, Chili oil and Hemp Seed Oil should not be merged together as they have different
  properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Chili oil is primarily used for its
  spicy flavor and is derived from chili peppers, while Hemp Seed Oil is derived from
  hemp seeds and is known for its nutritional benefits, such as being a good source
  of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.
