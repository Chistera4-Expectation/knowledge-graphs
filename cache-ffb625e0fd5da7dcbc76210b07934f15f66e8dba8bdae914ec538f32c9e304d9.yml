text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are derived from chicken, they have distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses.
  Chicken breast is leaner and lower in calories, while chicken drumsticks are darker
  meat with more fat and a richer flavor. They serve different purposes in various
  recipes and diets.
