  Chili bean paste and chili flakes are not semantic and ontological duplicates, even
  though they both involve chilies and can add spice to dishes. They have different
  culinary uses, textures, flavors, and appearances due to their unique ingredients
  and preparation methods. Chili bean paste is made from chilies, fermented beans,
  salt, and various seasonings, while chili flakes consist solely of dried, crushed
  red chilies. Merging them would disregard these crucial differences.'
