  Although both fresh cilantro leaves and fresh chili peppers belong to the broader
  category of edible vegetables, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They have distinct tastes, textures, appearances, uses in cooking, nutritional profiles,
  and cultural significance. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate
  entities within the classification system for accurate identification, description,
  and application.'
