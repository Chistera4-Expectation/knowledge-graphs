text: ' No. While "fresh fish" is a broad term that can include raw fish, not all
  fresh fish is intended to be eaten raw. Therefore, it is important to distinguish
  between "fresh fish" and "fresh raw fish" as separate concepts in order to provide
  accurate nutritional information and safe consumption guidelines.'
