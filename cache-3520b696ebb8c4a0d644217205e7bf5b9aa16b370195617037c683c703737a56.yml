text: As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspects of these
  types of water, but I am not an expert in semantic or ontological matters. From
  a nutritional standpoint, glacier water and mineral water can have some differences,
  such as mineral content. Therefore, they are not necessarily duplicates. However,
  the decision to merge instances in a class would depend on the specific context
  and requirements of the system or database in question.
