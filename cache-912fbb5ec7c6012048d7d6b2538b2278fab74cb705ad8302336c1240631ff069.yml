text: ' No. Total fat per serving and Vitamin A content per serving are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. They represent different nutritional aspects of cheese.
  The former refers to the amount of fat contained in one serving of cheese, while
  the latter indicates how much Vitamin A is present in that same serving size. Merging
  them would result in loss of important information regarding their individual contributions
  to nutrition.'
