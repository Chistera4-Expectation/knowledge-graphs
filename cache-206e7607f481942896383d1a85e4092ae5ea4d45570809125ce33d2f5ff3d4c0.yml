  While red chili powder and white pepper powder may both be considered spices and
  have similar functions in cooking (i.e., adding flavor), they are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates. Semantically, they refer to different ingredients with distinct
  flavors, appearances, and uses in recipes. Ontologically, they belong to different
  categories of food products and serve unique culinary purposes. Therefore, it is
  important to maintain them as separate entities.'
