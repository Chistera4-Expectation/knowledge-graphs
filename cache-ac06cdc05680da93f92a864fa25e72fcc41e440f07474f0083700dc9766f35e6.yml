text: No, Goat cheese and Pecorino Romano cheese should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. Although both are cheeses, they are made from
  different types of milk (Goat cheese from goat's milk and Pecorino Romano cheese
  from sheep's milk), which can have different nutritional profiles and affect dietary
  recommendations.
