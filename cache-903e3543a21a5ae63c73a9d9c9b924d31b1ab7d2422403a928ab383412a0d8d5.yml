  Miso paste and tamarind paste are not semantic or ontological duplicates and should
  not be merged together. While both are used as flavorings in cooking, they have
  different tastes, appearances, textures, uses, and nutritional profiles. Miso paste
  is made from fermented soybeans and has a rich, savory umami taste, while tamarind
  paste comes from the pulp of the tamarind fruit and has a sour-sweet tang. They
  serve distinct purposes in various cuisines worldwide, such as Japanese miso soup
  and Indian tamarind chutney, and offer unique health benefits. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two food seasonings as duplicates.'
