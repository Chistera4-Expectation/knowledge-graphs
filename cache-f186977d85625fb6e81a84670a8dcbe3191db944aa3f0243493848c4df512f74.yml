  While both "Comb Honey" and "Eucalyptus Honey" are types of honey, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct characteristics that differentiate
  them from each other. Comb Honey is honey still contained within the original hexagonal
  wax cells of the beehive, while Eucalyptus Honey is honey made primarily from the
  nectar of eucalyptus flowers. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two instances.'
