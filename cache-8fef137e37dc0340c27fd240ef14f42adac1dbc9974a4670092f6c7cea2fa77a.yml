text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of spices, they
  have different flavors, heat levels, and uses in cooking. Ground black pepper is
  milder and more commonly used for seasoning, while red chili peppers add a spicy
  kick to dishes and are often used in hot sauces or as a garnish. Merging them would
  lose the distinct characteristics of each spice.
