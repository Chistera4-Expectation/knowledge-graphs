text: No, Canola Oil and Pumpkin Seed Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of edible vegetable oils with
  distinct properties, nutritional profiles, and uses. While they can both be used
  in cooking and other applications, they are not the same oil.
