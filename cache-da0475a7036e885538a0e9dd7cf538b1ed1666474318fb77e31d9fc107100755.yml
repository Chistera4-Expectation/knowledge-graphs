text: ' Based on the given list, the most adequate class name for "Wrappers" would
  be difficult to determine without additional context. The term "wrappers" is not
  explicitly defined in this list and could refer to various food items such as edible
  films or coatings used in packaging, tortillas, or other types of flatbreads. Therefore,
  it would not fit neatly into any one category listed here. If you meant to ask about
  a specific type of wrapper or food item that belongs to one of these categories,
  please provide more details so I can help answer your question accurately.'
