text: As a dietician, my primary focus would be on the nutritional content and ingredients
  of the sauces rather than the semantic or ontological classification. However, if
  you are asking if 'Pesto sauce' and 'Tartar sauce' are the same type of sauce, the
  answer is no. They are different sauces with distinct ingredients and uses. So,
  they should not be merged together as duplicates.
