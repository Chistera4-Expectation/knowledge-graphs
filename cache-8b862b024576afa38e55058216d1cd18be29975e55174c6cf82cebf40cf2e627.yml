text: No, Icelandic Yogurt and Kefir Yogurt should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are yogurt types, they have distinct characteristics
  and nutritional profiles. Icelandic Yogurt, also known as skyr, is a strained yogurt
  with a thick, creamy texture and high protein content. Kefir Yogurt is a fermented
  milk product made with kefir grains, containing probiotics and a tangy taste. They
  should remain as separate instances in the Yogurt class.
