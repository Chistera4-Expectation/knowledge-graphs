text: No, Pork Ribs and Pork Shoulder should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they both come from pigs, they are different cuts
  of meat with distinct culinary uses and nutritional profiles. Pork Ribs come from
  the rib cage and are often cooked with a dry rub or barbecue sauce, while Pork Shoulder
  is a fattier cut that is typically slow-cooked or braised. They are not the same
  and should be kept separate in a Pork-derived Food class.
