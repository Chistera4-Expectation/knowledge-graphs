text: As a dietician, my answer is based on the nutritional content and properties
  of these sauces rather than their semantic or ontological aspects. Although 'Chili
  bean sauce' and 'Scotch bonnet pepper sauce' may have overlapping ingredients, they
  are not exact duplicates. Chili bean sauce typically contains fermented soybeans
  and chili peppers, while Scotch bonnet pepper sauce is primarily made of Scotch
  bonnet peppers, which are much hotter than most chili peppers. Therefore, they should
  not be merged together as duplicates, as they have distinct nutritional profiles
  and uses in cooking.
