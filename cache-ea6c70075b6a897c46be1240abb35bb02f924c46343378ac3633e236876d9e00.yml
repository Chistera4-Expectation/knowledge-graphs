text: No, Flaxseed Oil and Sunflower Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the edible vegetable oil
  class, they have distinct nutritional profiles, chemical compositions, and uses.
  Flaxseed oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and is often used for its health benefits,
  while sunflower oil is rich in vitamin E and is commonly used for cooking and frying.
