  Although both fenugreek seeds and quinoa seeds come from plants and can be classified
  under "edible seeds," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have
  different nutritional profiles, taste, texture, cultural origins, traditional uses,
  and culinary applications. Merging them would result in loss of valuable information
  and potentially lead to confusion regarding their distinct characteristics and benefits.'
