text: No, 'Pheasant Meat' and 'Pheasant Patties' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. 'Pheasant Meat' refers to the raw, unprocessed
  muscle tissue of a pheasant, while 'Pheasant Patties' are a specific preparation
  of the meat, usually formed into flat, round shapes for cooking. They are related
  concepts, but not the same thing.
