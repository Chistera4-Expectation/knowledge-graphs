text: ' No. White pepper powder and white pepper are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they are closely related. White pepper refers to the dried
  and unripe seeds of the pepper plant, while white pepper powder is made by grinding
  these seeds into a fine powder. Therefore, white pepper powder is a form or preparation
  of white pepper, but it is not the same thing.'
