text: No, Turkey Nuggets and Turkey Sausage should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although both are derived from turkey, they represent different food
  products with unique ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived food
  options available.
