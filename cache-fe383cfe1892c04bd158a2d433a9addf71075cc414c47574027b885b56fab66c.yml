text: No, Palm Oil and Rice Bran Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are different types of edible vegetable oils, derived
  from different sources (palm fruit for Palm Oil and rice bran for Rice Bran Oil)
  and possess distinct nutritional and chemical properties. Merging them would lead
  to incorrect information and misrepresentation of these oils.
