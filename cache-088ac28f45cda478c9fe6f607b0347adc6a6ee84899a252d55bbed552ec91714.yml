  While both "diced tomatoes" and "canned diced tomatoes" refer to chopped tomatoes,
  they are not semantically equivalent because of their different contexts: fresh
  vs canned. The former typically refers to fresh tomatoes that have been diced, while
  the latter specifically denotes canned tomatoes that have been pre-cut into small
  pieces. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entities for accurate
  representation of food items and nutrition information.'
