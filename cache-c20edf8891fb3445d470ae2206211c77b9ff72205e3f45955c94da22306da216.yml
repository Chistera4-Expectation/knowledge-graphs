text: No, the instances 'Ciabatta Bread' and 'Multigrain Bread' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of bread
  with distinct ingredients and nutritional profiles. Although both are types of bread,
  they have unique characteristics that make them separate entities.
