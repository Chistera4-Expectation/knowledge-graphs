  While both "The base ingredient of the sauce" and "Dipping sauce" may involve similar
  ingredients, they represent different concepts in terms of their role and usage
  within a culinary context.


  1. "The base ingredient of the sauce" refers to the primary component used in creating
  a sauce, which is then combined with other ingredients and flavors. This could include
  items such as broths, creams, or purees that form the foundation of various sauces.

  2. "Dipping sauce," on the other hand, denotes a specific type of condiment designed
  for dunking food into, usually before consumption. Dipping sauces are often served
  alongside appetizers like chicken wings, fries, or spring rolls. They can consist
  of numerous bases but have distinct purposes from the foundational elements of sauces
  mentioned above.


  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates since they serve unique functions in cooking and gastronomy.'
