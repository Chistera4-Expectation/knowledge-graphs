text: No, Acacia Honey and Wildflower Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although both are types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and origins. Acacia Honey is derived from the nectar of
  Acacia flowers, while Wildflower Honey is produced from the nectar of various wildflowers.
  Merging them would result in a loss of specific information about each type of honey.
