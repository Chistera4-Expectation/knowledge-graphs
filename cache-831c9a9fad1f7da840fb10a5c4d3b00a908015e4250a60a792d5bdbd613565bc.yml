text: No, Coconut Oil and Macadamia Nut Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct properties, nutritional profiles, and uses. Categorizing them separately
  allows for more accurate information and recommendations based on their unique characteristics.
