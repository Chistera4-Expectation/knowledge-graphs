text: ' No. Caesar Dressing and Yogurt Dressing are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  While both may be used as dressings, they have distinct ingredients and preparation
  methods. Caesar Dressing is typically made with mayonnaise, olive oil, lemon juice,
  garlic, Worcestershire sauce, anchovies, and croutons, while Yogurt Dressing can
  vary but often includes yogurt, vinegar or lemon juice, herbs, and spices.'
