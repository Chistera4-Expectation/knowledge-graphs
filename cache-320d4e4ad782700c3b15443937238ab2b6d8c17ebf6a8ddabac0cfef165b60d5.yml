  While both vegetable oil and palm oil are types of edible oils, they do not represent
  semantic and ontological duplicates because they come from different sources and
  may have unique nutritional profiles and uses. Vegetable oil is a general term used
  to describe oil extracted from various plant seeds, fruits, or nuts, while palm
  oil specifically refers to the oil derived from the fruit of palm trees (Elaeis
  guineensis). Therefore, it is essential to maintain separate categories for them.'
