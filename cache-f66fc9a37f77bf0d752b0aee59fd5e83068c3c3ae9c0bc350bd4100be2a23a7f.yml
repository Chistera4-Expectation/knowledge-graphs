text: No, Argan Oil and Sunflower Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they come from
  different plant sources (argan tree and sunflower, respectively), have different
  nutritional profiles, and are used for different purposes in culinary and cosmetic
  applications.
