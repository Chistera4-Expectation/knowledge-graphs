text: No, Chinese five-spice powder and onion powder should not be merged together
  as they have different ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. Chinese five-spice
  powder typically consists of star anise, cloves, Chinese cinnamon, Sichuan pepper,
  and fennel seeds, while onion powder is made from dehydrated onions and is used
  as a seasoning or flavoring agent. These two spices have distinct properties and
  cannot be considered semantic or ontologic duplicates.
