text: No, "Fried Egg" and "Fried Onions" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both prepared using the frying method,
  they are distinct edible vegetables. A fried egg is an egg that has been cooked
  in a pan with oil or butter, while fried onions are onions that have been sliced
  and cooked in oil or butter until they are tender and slightly browned. They are
  separate ingredients with unique nutritional values and uses in cooking.
