text: No, 'Assam Tea' and 'Pu-erh Tea' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both types of tea, they have distinct characteristics,
  origins, and brewing methods. Assam Tea is a black tea from Assam, India, known
  for its strong, malty flavor, while Pu-erh Tea is a fermented dark tea from Yunnan,
  China, known for its earthy, woody, and sometimes mushroom-like taste. Merging them
  together would not accurately represent the unique qualities and differences between
  these two types of tea.
