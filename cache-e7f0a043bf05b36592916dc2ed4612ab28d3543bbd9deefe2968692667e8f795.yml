text: No, the instances 'Cow's Milk' and 'Milk' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. 'Cow's Milk' is a specific type of milk, while 'Milk'
  is a more general term that can refer to various types of milk from different animals,
  including cows, goats, and sheep. Merging these two instances would lead to a loss
  of specificity and could result in confusion.
