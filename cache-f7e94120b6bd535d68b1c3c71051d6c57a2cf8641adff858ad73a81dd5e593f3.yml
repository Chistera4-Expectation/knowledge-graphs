text: As a dietician, my answer is no. While scallions and sliced onions are both
  types of onions, they are not the same in terms of taste, texture, and culinary
  uses. Scallions have a milder flavor and are often used raw in salads or as a garnish,
  while sliced onions have a stronger flavor and are commonly used in cooking. Therefore,
  they should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates.
