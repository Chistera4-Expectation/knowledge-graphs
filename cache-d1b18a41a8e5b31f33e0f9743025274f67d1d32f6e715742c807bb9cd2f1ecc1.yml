  While rice bran oil and palm oil may both fall under the category of edible vegetable
  oils, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come from different
  plant sources (rice vs. palm), have distinct nutritional profiles, and possess unique
  chemical properties that make them suitable for various applications. Therefore,
  it is essential to maintain these separate identities within the classification
  system.'
