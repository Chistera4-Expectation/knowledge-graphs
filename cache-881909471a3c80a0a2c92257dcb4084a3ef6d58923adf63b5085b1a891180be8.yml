  While both "Additional seasonings" and "Taco Seasoning" may involve adding flavor
  to food, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. "Taco Seasoning" is a
  specific type of seasoning mix used for preparing tacos, while "Additional seasonings"
  refers to any extra seasonings that can be added to a dish beyond what it already
  contains. Therefore, these two concepts have different meanings and uses in the
  context of a Food Seasoning class.'
