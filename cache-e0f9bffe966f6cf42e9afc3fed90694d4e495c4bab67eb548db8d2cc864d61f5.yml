text: No, Marinara sauce and Satay sauce should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are distinct sauces with different ingredients, flavors, and uses
  in cooking. While they may both be considered "sauces," they have unique characteristics
  that differentiate them from one another.
