text: ' No. While pork chops and pork ribs are both types of pork meat and share some
  similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of their cut, preparation,
  nutritional content, and culinary uses. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
