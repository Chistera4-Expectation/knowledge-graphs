text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are beans, they are different types
  of beans with different nutritional profiles and appearances. Green beans are a
  type of legume with a green color, while red beans, also known as kidney beans,
  are a type of legume with a red color. They should be treated as separate instances
  in the Edible Vegetable class.
