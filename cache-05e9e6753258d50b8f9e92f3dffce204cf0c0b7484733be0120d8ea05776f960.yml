text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Chili oil
  and peanut oil are different types of edible vegetal oils with distinct properties,
  flavors, and uses. While they share the commonality of being edible vegetal oils,
  they are not the same thing and should be treated as separate instances in a classification
  system.
