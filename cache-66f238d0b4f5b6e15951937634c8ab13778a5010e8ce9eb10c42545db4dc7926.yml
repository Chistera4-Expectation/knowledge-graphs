text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although both "Ostrich Patties" and "Pheasant Patties" are poultry-derived foods,
  they are distinct types of meat, each with their own unique nutritional profiles
  and properties. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the
  Poultry-derived Food class.
