  While both "Protein per serving" and "Vitamin A content per serving" provide information
  about nutritional value, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they measure different nutrients with distinct roles in human health. Protein is
  an essential macronutrient required for growth, repair, and maintenance of body
  tissues, while Vitamin A plays crucial roles in vision, immune function, and cellular
  communication. Therefore, it is important to keep them separate when describing
  cheese varieties in terms of their individual nutritional profiles.'
