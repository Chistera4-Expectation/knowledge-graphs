text: " No.\n\nWhile both grapeseed oil and peanut oil are types of edible vegetable\
  \ oils, they have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, taste,\
  \ smoke points, and culinary uses. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge\
  \ them as semantic and ontological duplicates.\n\nGrapeseed oil is extracted from\
  \ the seeds of grapes and has a light, neutral flavor with a high smoke point (around\
  \ 420\xB0F), making it suitable for saut\xE9ing, frying, and baking at high temperatures.\
  \ It is also rich in vitamin E and omega-6 fatty acids.\n\nOn the other hand, peanut\
  \ oil is derived from peanuts and has a strong, distinctive flavor that makes it\
  \ ideal for specific cuisines like Asian or Southern cooking. Peanut oil has various\
  \ smoke points depending on its type: refined peanut oil has a higher smoke point\
  \ (about 450\xB0F) than unrefined (also known as cold-pressed or virgin) peanut\
  \ oil (320\xB0F). Additionally, peanut oil contains monounsaturated and polyunsaturated\
  \ fats but lacks essential vitamins found in grapeseed oil."
