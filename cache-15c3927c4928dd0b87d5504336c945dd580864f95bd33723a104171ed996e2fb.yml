text: ' No. While both pieces of information are related to nutrition, they represent
  distinct concepts and should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  The "total fat per serving" provides information about the nutritional content of
  the cheese, while the "serving size" refers to the quantity being measured. Merging
  them would result in a loss of important context for each piece of data.'
