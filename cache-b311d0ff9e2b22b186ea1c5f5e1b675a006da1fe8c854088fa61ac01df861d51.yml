text: No, 'Lactose-free milk' and 'Soy Milk' should not be merged together as they
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. They are two distinct types of milk alternatives,
  with 'Lactose-free milk' being derived from cows' milk but with lactose removed,
  and 'Soy Milk' being a plant-based milk alternative made from soybeans. They have
  different nutritional profiles and are used by people for different dietary reasons.
