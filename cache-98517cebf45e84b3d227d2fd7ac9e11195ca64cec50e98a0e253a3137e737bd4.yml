text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, uses, and nutritional
  profiles. Wood ear mushrooms (Auricularia spp.) and Reishi mushrooms (Ganoderma
  lucidum) should be kept as separate instances in the Edible Mushrooms class.
