text: No, 'Alkaline Water' and 'Flavored Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of drinking water, they have distinct
  properties and characteristics. Alkaline water has a higher pH level and is believed
  to have potential health benefits, while flavored water is infused with natural
  or artificial flavors and may contain additional sweeteners. These differences make
  them unique and separate instances in the Drinking Water class.
