text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both "Chicken Drumsticks" and "Chicken" are poultry-derived food, they represent
  different cuts of meat with distinct nutritional profiles, cooking methods, and
  cultural uses. Thus, they are not considered duplicates in terms of semantics and
  ontology.
