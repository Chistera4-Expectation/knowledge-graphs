  While both apple seeds and fenugreek seeds come from plants and can be considered
  "seeds," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different
  nutritional profiles, uses, and safety considerations. Apple seeds contain small
  amounts of substances that can release cyanide and are generally not eaten in large
  quantities, while fenugreek seeds are used as a spice and herb and contain compounds
  with potential health benefits. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between
  these two types of seeds when discussing their properties and applications.'
