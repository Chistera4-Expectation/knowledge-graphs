text: No, Almond Oil and Avocado Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  properties, uses, and nutritional profiles. Almond Oil is derived from almond nuts,
  while Avocado Oil comes from avocado fruit. They have different fatty acid compositions,
  flavor profiles, and applications in cooking and cosmetics.
