text: ' No. While pork chops and pork loin are both cuts of pork and share certain
  similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of their location on the animal,
  culinary uses, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is appropriate to treat them
  as separate entities rather than merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
