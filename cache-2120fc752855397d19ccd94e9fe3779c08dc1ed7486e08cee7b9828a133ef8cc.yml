text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Pheasant Meatballs" and
  "Pheasant Soup" are derived from poultry, they are different dishes with distinct
  ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. Therefore, they should
  not be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.
