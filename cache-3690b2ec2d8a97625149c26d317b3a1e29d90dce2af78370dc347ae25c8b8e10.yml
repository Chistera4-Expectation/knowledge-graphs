text: No, Japonica Rice and Parboiled Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics
  and uses. Japonica Rice is a short-grain rice that is sticky when cooked and is
  commonly used in dishes like sushi and risotto. Parboiled Rice, on the other hand,
  is partially cooked in the husk, which makes it easier to digest and less likely
  to overcook. It is commonly used in dishes like pilaf and biryani. Therefore, they
  are not duplicates but rather distinct types of rice with unique properties and
  applications.
