text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and
  uses in cooking. Pesto sauce is typically made with basil, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese,
  and olive oil, while Sriracha sauce is a spicy chili sauce made from chili peppers,
  vinegar, garlic, and sugar. They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
