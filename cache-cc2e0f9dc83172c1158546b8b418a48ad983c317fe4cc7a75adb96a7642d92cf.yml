text: No, Linden Honey and Sage Honey should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates because they are two distinct types of honey with unique
  characteristics, flavors, and properties derived from the different plants they
  are sourced from (Linden and Sage). Although they both fall under the general category
  of honey, they have distinct identities and should be treated as separate instances.
