  While both "roasted turkey" and "turkey slices" are types of poultry-derived food,
  they do not represent the same concept and cannot be considered semantic or ontological
  duplicates.


  * Roasted turkey refers to an entire cooked bird (or large portions thereof) that
  has been roasted using dry heat. It can be served whole, carved into smaller pieces,
  or shredded for various dishes.

  * Turkey slices, on the other hand, typically refer to thinly sliced, prepackaged
  deli meat derived from a previously cooked turkey. These slices may come from any
  cooking method (including roasting), but their defining characteristic is the thinly
  sliced format intended for sandwiches or similar uses.


  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts, as each represents
  distinct aspects within the poultry-derived food domain.'
