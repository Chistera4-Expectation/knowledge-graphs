text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both Guinea Fowl Patties and Guinea Fowl Sausage are derived from the same source,
  they are different food products with distinct shapes, textures, and possibly ingredient
  combinations. Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived
  food products available.
