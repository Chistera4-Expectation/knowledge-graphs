  While both "chicken pieces" and "chicken pot pie" are related to poultry-derived
  food, they do not represent the same concept and cannot be considered semantic or
  ontological duplicates. Chicken pieces refer to individual parts of a chicken, such
  as breasts, thighs, or wings, whereas chicken pot pie is a specific dish made with
  chicken, vegetables, and gravy inside a pastry crust. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
