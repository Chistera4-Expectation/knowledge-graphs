text: No, the instances 'Cremini Mushroom' and 'Hedgehog Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible mushrooms,
  they are different species with distinct characteristics, appearances, and culinary
  uses. Cremini mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) are a variety of button mushrooms, while
  hedgehog mushrooms (Hydnum repandum) have a unique appearance with spines instead
  of gills.
