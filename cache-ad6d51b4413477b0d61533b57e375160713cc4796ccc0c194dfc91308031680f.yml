  Chia seeds and fennel seeds are two distinct seed types with different nutritional
  profiles. While they are both seeds and may be consumed as part of a healthy diet,
  they have different chemical compositions and health benefits. Therefore, they should
  not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
