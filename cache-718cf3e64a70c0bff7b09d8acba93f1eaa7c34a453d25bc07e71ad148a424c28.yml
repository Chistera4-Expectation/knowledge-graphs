text: ' No. Blackberry honey and linden honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  even though they both fall under the category of "honey." They have different taste,
  color, and aroma profiles due to their unique floral sources (blackberries vs. lindens).
  Therefore, it is important to distinguish between them for accurate labeling, nutritional
  information, and consumer preference purposes.'
