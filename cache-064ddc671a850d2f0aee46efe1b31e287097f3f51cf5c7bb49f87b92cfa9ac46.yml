text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of food products
  derived from Guinea Fowl. Guinea Fowl Sausage is a processed meat product, while
  Guinea Fowl Stock is a liquid broth made from simmering Guinea Fowl bones and other
  ingredients. Although both are derived from Guinea Fowl, they serve different culinary
