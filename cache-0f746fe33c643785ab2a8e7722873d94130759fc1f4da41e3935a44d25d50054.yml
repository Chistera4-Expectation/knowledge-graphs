  Although both Arborio rice and cooked white rice can be classified under the general
  category of "rice," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they
  have different properties and uses. Arborio is a type of Italian short-grain rice
  that is typically used for making risotto due to its high starch content, while
  cooked white rice refers to any variety of rice that has been processed and cooked,
  resulting in a soft, fluffy texture. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep these
  two instances separate.'
