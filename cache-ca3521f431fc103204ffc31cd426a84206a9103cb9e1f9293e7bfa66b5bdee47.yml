  The two instances you provided, ''is\_healthier\_than(other\_butter)'' and ''compares
  the nutrition info of this instance of butter to another instance of butter and
  returns a boolean indicating whether this instance is healthier'', can be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates. They both convey the same meaning and describe
  the same action, which is comparing the nutritional information of one instance
  of butter to another and returning a boolean value based on their relative healthiness.
  Therefore, it would make sense to merge them into a single concept.'
