text: No, "Ostrich Eggs" and "Ostrich Wings" should not be merged together as they
  are different parts of an ostrich and serve different nutritional purposes. While
  both are derived from poultry, they are distinct food items and should be treated
  as separate entities in a Poultry-derived Food class.
