text: No, Ciabatta Bread and Naan Bread should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of bread, they have distinct
  differences in ingredients, preparation, and cultural origins. Ciabatta Bread is
  an Italian white bread made with wheat flour, water, yeast, and salt, while Naan
  Bread is a South Asian leavened flatbread made with wheat flour, yogurt, milk, and
  ghee.
