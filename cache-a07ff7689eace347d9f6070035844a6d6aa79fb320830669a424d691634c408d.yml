text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of honey with distinct
  flavor profiles and properties. Clover honey is known for its mild, sweet flavor,
  while Sourwood honey has a more robust, slightly tangy taste. Although they both
  fall under the category of honey, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
