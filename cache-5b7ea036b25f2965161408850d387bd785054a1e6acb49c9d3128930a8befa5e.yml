text: ' No. Basmati rice and rice paper wrappers are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  as they refer to two different types of food products with distinct nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking.


  Basmati rice is a type of long-grain rice that originated in the Indian subcontinent.
  It is known for its aromatic quality and delicate texture when cooked. Like other
  varieties of rice, basmati rice is primarily composed of carbohydrates and provides
  energy, fiber, and some essential vitamins and minerals such as B vitamins, iron,
  magnesium, and selenium.


  On the other hand, rice paper wrappers are thin sheets made from ground rice, water,
  and sometimes tapioca flour. They are commonly used in Vietnamese cuisine to make
  summer rolls or fresh spring rolls. Rice paper wrappers are low in calories and
  have minimal nutrients since they are mainly composed of starch. However, they serve
  as an alternative to wheat-based wraps or tortillas, making them suitable for those
  following gluten-free diets.


  Given their unique properties, it would not be appropriate to merge the instances
  ''Basmati rice'' and ''Rice paper wrappers'' as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
