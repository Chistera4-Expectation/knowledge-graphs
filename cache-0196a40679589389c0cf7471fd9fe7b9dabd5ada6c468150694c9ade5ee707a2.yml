text: 'No, the instances "Beech Mushroom" and "Optional: Wood ear mushrooms" should
  not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, appearances, and uses
  in cooking. Merging them would result in a loss of important information and distort
  the categorization of edible mushrooms.'
