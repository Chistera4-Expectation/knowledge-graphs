text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both duck gravy and turkey gravy are derived from poultry, they are distinct types
  of gravy made from different sources (duck and turkey) and may have different flavor
  profiles and preparation methods. Therefore, they should be treated as separate
  instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
