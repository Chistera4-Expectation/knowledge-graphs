  While condensed milk and evaporated milk are both concentrated forms of milk that
  have been heated to remove water, they differ in their sugar content: condensed
  milk is sweetened with added sugar, while evaporated milk is unsweetened. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates,
  since they refer to distinct products with different nutritional profiles.'
