text: ' No. Corn oil and peanut oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates, even
  though they belong to the same category of edible vegetable oils. They come from
  different plant sources (corn vs. peanuts) and have distinct nutritional profiles
  and uses in cooking, making them unique within their shared domain. Therefore, it
  is appropriate for these two instances to remain separate.'
