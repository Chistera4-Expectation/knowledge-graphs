text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both are types of drinking water, they have distinct characteristics and sources.
  Electrolyte water is typically enhanced with electrolytes for hydration, whereas
  well water comes from underground sources and can vary in quality depending on its
  origin and filtration.
