text: No, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Sunflower Oil should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct properties, nutritional profiles, and uses. Merging them would not
  accurately represent the unique characteristics of each oil.
