text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they
  both belong to the same class (Sauce), 'Curry sauce' is a specific type of sauce,
  which means it has its own unique properties and characteristics. Merging them would
  lose this distinction and make it difficult to differentiate between different types
  of sauces.
