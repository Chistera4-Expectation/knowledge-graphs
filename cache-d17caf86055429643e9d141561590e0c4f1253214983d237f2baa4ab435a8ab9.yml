text: No, Cashew Milk and Whole Milk should not be merged as they are different types
  of milk with distinct nutritional profiles and production methods. Cashew Milk is
  a plant-based milk alternative made from cashews, while Whole Milk is a dairy product
  obtained from cow's milk. These differences make them separate instances within
  the Milk class.
