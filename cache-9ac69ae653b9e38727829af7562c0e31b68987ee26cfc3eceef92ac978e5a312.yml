text: ' No. While "Feta cheese" is a type of cheese, it would not typically be considered
  a duplicate of the more general category "name of the cheese." This is because "name
  of the cheese" could refer to any type of cheese, whereas "Feta cheese" refers specifically
  to a particular variety that originated in Greece. It is important to maintain this
  level of specificity when creating and organizing categories for different types
  of cheeses.'
