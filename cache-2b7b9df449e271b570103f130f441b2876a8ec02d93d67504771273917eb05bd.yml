  While rice bran oil is a type of vegetable oil (as it is also derived from plants),
  not all vegetable oils are rice bran oil. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They each have distinct properties, nutritional profiles,
  and uses that make them unique within the category of edible oils.'
