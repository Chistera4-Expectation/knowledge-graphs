text: No, "Wonton wrappers" and "habanero peppers" should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are separate and distinct food items, with
  different nutritional properties and culinary uses. Wonton wrappers are a type of
  dough used in Chinese cuisine, while habanero peppers are a type of chili pepper
  with a high spice level. They do not share the same characteristics that would warrant
  merging them as duplicates.
