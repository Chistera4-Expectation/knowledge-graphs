text: 'No, "Kefir Yogurt" and "Vegan Yogurt" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of yogurt, they have distinct
  characteristics:


  1. Kefir Yogurt: It is a fermented milk product made with kefir grains, which are
  a combination of bacteria and yeast. Kefir yogurt has a slightly tangy taste and
  a thinner consistency compared to regular yogurt.


  2. Vegan Yogurt: This is a plant-based alternative to dairy yogurt, typically made
  from ingredients such as soy, coconut, almond, or cashew milk. Vegan yogurt is suitable
  for those who avoid dairy products or follow a vegan diet.


  While both are types of yogurt, they have different compositions and are suitable
  for different dietary needs and preferences.'
