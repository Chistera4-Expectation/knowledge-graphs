text: As a dietician, my focus would be on the nutritional aspects of the beverages,
  not their classification in a software or programming context. However, in terms
  of classification, it depends on the specific definitions and criteria used for
  'Irish Coffee' and 'Vienna Coffee'. If they are indeed the same or very similar
  in composition and preparation, then they could be considered semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. But this decision should be based on a thorough understanding of the
  specific definitions and criteria used for each type of coffee.
