  While Russian dressing and Thousand Island dressing have some similarities in terms
  of ingredients (mayonnaise, ketchup, relish), they are distinct dressings with their
  own unique flavor profiles and histories. Russian dressing typically includes additional
  ingredients like horseradish and paprika, while Thousand Island dressing often contains
  chopped hard-boiled eggs and green olives. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
