text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of tea, 'Green Tea' and
  'Rooibos Tea' have different properties and characteristics. Green Tea is made from
  the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, while Rooibos Tea comes from the Aspalathus
  linearis plant and is a herbal tea without caffeine.
