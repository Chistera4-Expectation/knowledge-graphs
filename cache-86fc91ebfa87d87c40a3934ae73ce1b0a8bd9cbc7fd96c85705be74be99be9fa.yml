text: ' No. While mealworms and silkworms are both types of insects that can be used
  in food production, they belong to different taxonomic families (Tenebrionidae and
  Bombycidae, respectively) and have distinct characteristics such as appearance,
  nutritional profiles, and cultural significance. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
