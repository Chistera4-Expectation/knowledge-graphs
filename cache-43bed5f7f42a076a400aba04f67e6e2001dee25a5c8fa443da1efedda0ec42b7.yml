text: No, they should not be merged as they are not duplicates. While both are derived
  from ostrich, they are different types of food products with distinct preparation
  methods and characteristics. Ostrich gravy is typically a sauce made from ostrich
  meat or drippings, whereas ostrich soup is a broth-based dish containing ostrich
  meat and other ingredients.
