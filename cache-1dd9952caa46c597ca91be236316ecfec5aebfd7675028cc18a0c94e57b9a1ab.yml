text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of tea with distinct
  characteristics and flavor profiles. Assam Tea is a black tea from the Assam region
  in India, while Ginger Tea is a tea infused with ginger root, which can be made
  from various tea bases. While they may share some similarities, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
