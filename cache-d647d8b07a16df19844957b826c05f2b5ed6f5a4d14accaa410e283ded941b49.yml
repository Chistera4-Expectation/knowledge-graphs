  Although both bean sprouts and black beans belong to the same food category (edible
  vegetables), they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They have different
  nutritional profiles, textures, tastes, culinary uses, and growth processes. Bean
  sprouts typically refer to germinated seeds of various legumes like mung beans,
  while black beans are mature dried seeds from specific plant species such as Phaseolus
  vulgaris. Merging them would lead to confusion and loss of essential information
  regarding their distinct characteristics.'
