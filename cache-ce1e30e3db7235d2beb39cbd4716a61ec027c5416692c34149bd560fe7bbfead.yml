text: No, the instances 'Flying fish' and 'Sushi-grade fish' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Flying fish is a specific species
  of fish, while sushi-grade fish is a quality classification for fish that can be
  safely consumed raw or used in sushi dishes. They are not the same thing and have
  different characteristics and uses.
