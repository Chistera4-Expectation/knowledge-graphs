  While chia seeds and hemp seeds have some similarities (both are high in fiber and
  omega-3 fatty acids), they also have distinct nutritional profiles and uses. Chia
  seeds contain higher levels of antioxidants, while hemp seeds provide more protein
  and essential amino acids. Merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates would
  not accurately reflect their unique characteristics and benefits.'
