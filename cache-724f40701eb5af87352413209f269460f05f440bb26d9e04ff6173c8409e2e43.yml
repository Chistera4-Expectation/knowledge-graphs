text: ' The most adequate class for "Protein shakes" would be "Protein Beverage".
  This category specifically refers to drinks that are primarily composed of protein,
  making it an appropriate fit for protein shakes. Other options like Alcoholic Drink,
  Coffee, Drinking Water, Edible Vegetable Oil, Energy Drink, Honey, Juice, Milk,
  and Tea do not fall under this classification as they serve different nutritional
  purposes.'
