text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different types of sauces
  with distinct ingredients and uses. Enchilada sauce is a spicy sauce typically made
  from tomatoes, chili peppers, and spices, while sour sauce is a tangy sauce made
  from vinegar, sugar, and spices. These sauces have different flavor profiles and
  serve different purposes in cooking.
