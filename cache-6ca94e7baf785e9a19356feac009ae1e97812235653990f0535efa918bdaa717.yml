text: ' No. Almond milk is not a true duplicate of dairy milk, either semantically
  or ontologically. Semantically, they have different meanings because almond milk
  is made from almonds and water while dairy milk comes from animals such as cows.
  Ontologically, they belong to distinct categories: plant-based vs animal-derived
  products. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as
  duplicates.'
