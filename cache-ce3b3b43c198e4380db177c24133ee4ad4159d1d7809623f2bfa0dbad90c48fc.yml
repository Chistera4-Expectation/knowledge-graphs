text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  "Cumin powder" and "Cumin" refer to the same spice, they represent different forms
  of the spice (powdered vs. whole seeds). It is useful to distinguish between these
  forms in a classification system for recipes and cooking purposes.
