  While both baking powder and seasoning cubes may be used to add flavor to food,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they serve different purposes
  and have distinct properties. Baking powder is primarily used as a leavening agent
  in baked goods, while seasoning cubes (also known as bouillon cubes) are used to
  add savory flavors to soups, stews, and other dishes. Additionally, baking powder
  contains ingredients such as baking soda, cream of tartar, and cornstarch, whereas
  seasoning cubes typically contain dehydrated vegetables, meat, or seafood, along
  with salt and various spices. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these
  two concepts as duplicates.'
