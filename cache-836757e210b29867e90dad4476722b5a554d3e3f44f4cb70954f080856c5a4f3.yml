text: No, 'Redfish' and 'Swordfish' should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates because they are different species of fish with distinct
  characteristics and nutritional profiles. Redfish (also known as ocean perch or
  rosefish) belongs to the family Sebastidae, while Swordfish belongs to the family
  Xiphiidae. They have different appearances, tastes, and nutritional values, and
  should be treated as separate instances in the Edible Fish class.
