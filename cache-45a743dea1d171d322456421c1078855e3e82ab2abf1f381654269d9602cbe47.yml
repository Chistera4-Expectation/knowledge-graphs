text: 'No, the instances ''Optional: Wood ear mushrooms'' and ''Shiitake mushrooms''
  should not be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although both
  are edible mushrooms, they are distinct species with unique characteristics, flavors,
  and nutritional profiles. Merging them would not accurately represent the information
  about each specific mushroom.'
