text: No, Raw Honey and Sunflower Honey should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of honey with different characteristics and nutritional profiles.
  Raw honey refers to honey that is unprocessed and unheated, while Sunflower Honey
  is honey derived specifically from sunflower nectar. Although both are types of
  honey, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
