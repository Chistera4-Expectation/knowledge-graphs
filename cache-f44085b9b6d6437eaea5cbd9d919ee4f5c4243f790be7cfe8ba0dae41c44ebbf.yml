  and "Poultry-derived Food".**


  Lamb belongs to the class "Lamb", which is distinct from "Beef", "Pork-derived Food",
  and "Poultry-derived Food". Lamb is a specific type of ruminant mammal, while "Beef",
  "Pork-derived Food", and "Poultry-derived Food" are broader categories of meat.


  Therefore, "Lamb" is the most adequate class for "Lamb" in this context, as it is
  the most specific category.'
