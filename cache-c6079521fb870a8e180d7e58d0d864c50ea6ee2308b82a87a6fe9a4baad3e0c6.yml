text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Oxygenated Water and Water
  involve the presence of oxygen, they are different in terms of their properties
  and applications. Oxygenated Water typically refers to water that has been infused
  with additional oxygen molecules, often through a process called electrolysis. This
  type of water may have potential health benefits and is marketed as a supplement.
  On the other hand, Water refers to the basic substance, H2O, which is essential
  for life and has various uses in daily life, such as drinking, cooking, and cleaning.
  Merging these two instances would lead to confusion and inaccurate classification
  in a dietary context.
