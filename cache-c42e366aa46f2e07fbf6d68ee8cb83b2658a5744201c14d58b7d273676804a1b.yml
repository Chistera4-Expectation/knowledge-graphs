  While both dishes contain chicken, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they represent different culinary preparations with distinct ingredients
  and flavors. Chicken curry typically consists of chicken cooked in a sauce made
  from various spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili peppers, often
  served over rice. On the other hand, Chicken parmesan is an Italian-American dish
  featuring breaded and fried chicken topped with tomato sauce and melted cheese,
  usually served with pasta on the side. Therefore, these two items have unique characteristics
  that warrant their separate classification.'
