text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both 'Purified Water' and 'Well
  Water' fall under the broader category of drinking water, they have distinct characteristics
  and sources. Purified water typically undergoes a filtration process to remove impurities,
  while well water is drawn from underground sources and may contain minerals and
  natural contaminants. Merging them would obscure these differences and make it difficult
  to provide accurate information about their respective properties and uses.
