text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both Guinea Fowl Tenders and Guinea Fowl Wings are derived from the same animal,
  they are different cuts of meat and have distinct culinary uses and nutritional
  values. Merging them as duplicates would not accurately represent the differences
  between the two types of poultry-derived food.
