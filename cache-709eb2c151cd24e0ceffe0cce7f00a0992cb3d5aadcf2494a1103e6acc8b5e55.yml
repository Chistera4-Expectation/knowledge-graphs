text: ' No. While both "nuts" and "other nuts" may seem similar, they are not necessarily
  semantic or ontological duplicates. The term "nuts" typically refers to a specific
  group of edible seeds that come from trees and plants (such as almonds, walnuts,
  hazelnuts, etc.). On the other hand, "other nuts" could refer to any additional
  types of edible seeds that do not fall under the traditional definition of "nuts,"
  such as sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, etc. Therefore, it is important
  to maintain these distinctions when discussing different types of edible seeds in
  a dietary context.'
