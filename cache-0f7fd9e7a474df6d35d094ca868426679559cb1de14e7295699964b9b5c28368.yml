  The terms "diced guava" and "guava jam" refer to different forms of the fruit, with
  distinct textures and consistencies. While they share some similarities in terms
  of their flavor profile and nutritional content, they are not interchangeable in
  recipes or culinary applications. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate
  as distinct instances in the Edible Fruit class.'
