text: No, Amaranth Seeds and Melon Seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are edible seeds, they come from different
  plant species and have distinct nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and cultural
  significance. They should be treated as separate instances in the Edible Seeds class.
