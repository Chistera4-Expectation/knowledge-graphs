text: ' No. Avocado oil and sunflower oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they may both fall under the broader category of edible vegetable oils, they
  have distinct chemical compositions, nutritional profiles, flavors, uses, and production
  methods that make them unique from one another. Therefore, it is important to keep
  these two instances separate when discussing or categorizing different types of
  edible vegetable oils.'
