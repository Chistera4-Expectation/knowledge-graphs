text: No, they should not be merged together as they are two distinct sauces with
  different ingredients, flavors, and uses. Hoisin sauce is a sweet and savory sauce
  commonly used in Chinese cuisine, while Tartar sauce is a creamy sauce typically
  served with seafood. They have different semantic and ontologic meanings.
