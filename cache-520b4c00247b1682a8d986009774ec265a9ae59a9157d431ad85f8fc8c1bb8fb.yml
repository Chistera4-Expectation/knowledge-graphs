  Although both duck broth and duck gravy are derived from ducks, they have different
  properties, textures, and uses in cooking. Duck broth is typically a clear liquid
  made by simmering duck bones, meat, and vegetables, while duck gravy is a thicker
  sauce made from the drippings of cooked duck, often combined with a thickening agent
  like flour or cornstarch. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.
