  While both "Comb Honey" and "Sage Honey" are types of honey, they refer to different
  forms and sources of honey. Comb Honey is pure, raw honey that still contains beeswax
  comb while Sage Honey is a type of varietal honey made from the nectar of sage plants.
  Therefore, they have distinct characteristics and cannot be considered semantic
  or ontological duplicates.'
