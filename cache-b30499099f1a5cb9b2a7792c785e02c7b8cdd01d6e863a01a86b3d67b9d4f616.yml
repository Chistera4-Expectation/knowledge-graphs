text: 'As a dietician, my answer would be: It depends on how the classes are defined
  and how they are intended to be used. If "Green Tea" and "Infused Tea" share the
  same characteristics and attributes, then they could potentially be merged. However,
  if there are differences in their preparation, nutritional value, or cultural significance,
  they may need to remain separate classes to maintain accuracy and utility in the
  context of the Tea class. A more detailed analysis of the classes and their intended
  use is necessary to make a definitive decision.'
