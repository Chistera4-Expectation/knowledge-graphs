text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are derived from Guinea Fowl,
  they have different uses and compositions. Guinea Fowl Broth is a liquid resulting
  from the cooking of Guinea Fowl, often used as a base for soups or sauces. Guinea
  Fowl Gravy, on the other hand, is a thickened sauce made from the drippings of cooked
  Guinea Fowl, often served with the meat. Although both are related to Guinea Fowl,
  they serve different culinary purposes and should be considered distinct entities
  within the Poultry-derived Food class.
