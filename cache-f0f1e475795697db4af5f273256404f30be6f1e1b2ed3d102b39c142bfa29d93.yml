text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food. Guinea Fowl Meatballs is a specific dish made from ground Guinea Fowl meat,
  while Pheasant Meat refers to the raw meat from Pheasants. Although both are poultry-derived,
  they have different characteristics, recipes, and culinary uses.
