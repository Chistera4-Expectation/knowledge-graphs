text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both 'Crab' and 'Snow Crab' are edible crustaceans, they are different species with
  distinct characteristics and flavors. Snow Crab is a specific type of crab, while
  'Crab' is a more general term that can encompass various crab species, including
  Snow Crab. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within the Edible
  Crustaceans class.
