text: ' No. Fiber per serving and Vitamin A content per serving are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates. While both provide nutritional information about cheese
  servings, they refer to different types of nutrients with distinct roles in health.
  Therefore, it is appropriate for them to remain separate attributes within the "Cheese"
  class.'
