text: ' "Pasta Types" would be the most appropriate category for comparing different
  types of pasta, as it specifically relates to various kinds of this food item. The
  other options listed are either broad categories that include many different types
  of foods or specific ingredients used in cooking and preparing meals. By choosing
  "Pasta Types," you can more accurately compare and evaluate the nutritional content
  and health benefits of different varieties of pasta, such as whole wheat, gluten-free,
  or vegetable-based pastas.'
