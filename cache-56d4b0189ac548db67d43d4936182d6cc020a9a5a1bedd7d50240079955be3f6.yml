text: ' No. Cottonseed oil and sunflower oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils. They come
  from different plants and have distinct nutritional profiles, production methods,
  and uses. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate instances.'
