text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of cheese, they
  have distinct characteristics and uses in cooking and nutrition. Blue cheese and
  Ricotta cheese have different flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles, which
  make them unique and valuable as separate entities in a cheese classification system.
