text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are edible vegetable oils,
  they have different properties, nutritional profiles, and uses. Extra Virgin Olive
  Oil is primarily used for cooking, dressings, and marinades, while Flaxseed Oil
  is often used as a dietary supplement due to its high omega-3 content. Merging them
  would not accurately represent the differences between the two oils.
