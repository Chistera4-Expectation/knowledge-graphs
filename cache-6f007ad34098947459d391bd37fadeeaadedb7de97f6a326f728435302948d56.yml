  While cinnamon sticks and cinnamon both come from the same tree (Cinnamomum verum
  or Cinnamomum cassia), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have
  different physical forms and uses in cooking, even though they share similar flavors
  and aromas due to containing the same active ingredient (cinnamaldehyde). Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate for clarity and accuracy when discussing
  food seasonings.'
