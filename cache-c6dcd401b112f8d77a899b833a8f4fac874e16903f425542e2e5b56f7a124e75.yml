text: No, they should not be merged as they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and
  uses in cooking. Chili bean sauce is typically made from fermented soybeans, chili
  peppers, and spices, while Teriyaki sauce is a sweet and savory sauce made from
  soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients like ginger or garlic.
  Although both are sauces, they serve different purposes and have unique flavor profiles.
