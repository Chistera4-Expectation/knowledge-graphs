text: No, Chinese five-spice powder and turmeric powder should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are spices, they have distinct
  compositions, flavors, and uses in cooking. Chinese five-spice powder typically
  contains star anise, cloves, Chinese cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds,
  while turmeric powder is made from ground turmeric root and has a unique earthy
  flavor and yellow color.
