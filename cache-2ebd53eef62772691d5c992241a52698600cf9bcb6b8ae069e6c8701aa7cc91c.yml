text: No, the instances 'Turkey Thighs' and 'Turkey' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from turkey, they represent
  different cuts of meat with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Merging
  them would lose the specificity of the information.
