text: As a dietician, my answer is no, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both beet and tomato juice are juices, they have distinct nutritional
  profiles and properties. Beet juice is rich in nitrates, antioxidants, and potassium,
  while tomato juice is a good source of vitamin C, vitamin A, and lycopene. Merging
  them would disregard their unique nutritional value and benefits.
