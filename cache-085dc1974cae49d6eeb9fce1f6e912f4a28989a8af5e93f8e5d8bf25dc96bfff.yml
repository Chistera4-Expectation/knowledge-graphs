text: ' No. While flaxseeds and hemp seeds have some similarities (for example, they
  are both sources of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids), they also have important differences
  in terms of their nutritional profiles and potential health benefits. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to maintain them as separate instances within the category of
  edible seeds.'
