  While avocado oil and grapeseed oil are both edible vegetable oils, they have different
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and extraction processes. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. It is important
  to maintain their distinct identities within the classification system for accurate
  information and decision-making related to health and cooking purposes.'
