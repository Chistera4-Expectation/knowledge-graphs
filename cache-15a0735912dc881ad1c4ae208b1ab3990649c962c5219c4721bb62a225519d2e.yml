text: ' No. Peanut oil and pumpkin seed oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged together. While they are both types of edible vegetable
  oils, they come from different plants (peanuts vs. pumpkin seeds) and have distinct
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it is important to maintain
  them as separate entities in a classification system for edible oils.'
