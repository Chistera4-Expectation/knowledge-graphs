text: ' No. Basmati rice and Jasmine rice, while similar in some ways (both are long-grain
  rices), have distinct differences in taste, aroma, texture, and origin. Therefore,
  they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates in the context
  of a rice classification system. It is important to maintain their unique identities
  due to these variations that can significantly impact cooking applications and culinary
  experiences.'
