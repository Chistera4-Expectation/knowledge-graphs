  While both are vegetable oils, they have distinct properties, uses, and nutritional
  profiles. Palm oil is derived from the fruit of the oil palm tree and is commonly
  used in food manufacturing due to its stability and affordability. Sesame oil is
  derived from sesame seeds and is known for its nutty aroma and flavor, making it
  a popular choice in Asian cuisine.
