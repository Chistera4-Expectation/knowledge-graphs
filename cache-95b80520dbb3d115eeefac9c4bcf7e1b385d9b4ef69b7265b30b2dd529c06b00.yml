text: No, 'Chili sauce' and 'Tomato sauce' should not be merged as they are different
  types of sauces with distinct ingredients and flavors. While both may contain tomatoes,
  chili sauce typically includes chili peppers and is spicier, while tomato sauce
  is generally milder and may include additional seasonings. Merging them would not
  accurately reflect their unique characteristics.
