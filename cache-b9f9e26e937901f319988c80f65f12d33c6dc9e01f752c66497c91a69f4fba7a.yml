text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  they both are types of yogurt, 'Creamy Yogurt' and 'Probiotic Yogurt' have distinct
  characteristics and nutritional profiles. Creamy Yogurt generally refers to a richer,
  smoother texture, while Probiotic Yogurt contains live and active cultures that
  are beneficial for gut health. Merging them would result in the loss of these unique
  attributes.
