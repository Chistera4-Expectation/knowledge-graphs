text: No, 'Chicken Liver' and 'Turkey Liver' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both poultry-derived food and share some
  similarities, they are distinct types of liver from different species of birds,
  each with its own nutritional profile, culinary uses, and potential dietary preferences
  or restrictions.
