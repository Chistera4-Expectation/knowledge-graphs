text: ' No. Grated Parmesan cheese and serving size of cheese are not semantic and
  ontological duplicates because they refer to different aspects of cheese. Grated
  Parmesan cheese is a type of cheese, while serving size refers to the amount of
  cheese being considered for consumption. It would be more appropriate to consider
  them related concepts rather than duplicates.'
