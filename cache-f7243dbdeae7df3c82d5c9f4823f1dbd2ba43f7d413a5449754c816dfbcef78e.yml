  While soybean oil is a type of cooking oil, they are not synonymous terms. Cooking
  oil is a broader category that encompasses various types of oils used for cooking,
  including but not limited to soybean oil. Each type of cooking oil has unique properties
  and uses, so it's essential to differentiate between them.
