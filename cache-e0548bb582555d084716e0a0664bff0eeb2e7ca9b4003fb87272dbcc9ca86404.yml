text: No, the instances 'Green bell pepper' and 'Green chili' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. They are different vegetables with
  distinct flavors, appearances, and uses in cooking. While they both belong to the
  same Edible Vegetable class, they have unique characteristics that warrant separate
  classifications.
