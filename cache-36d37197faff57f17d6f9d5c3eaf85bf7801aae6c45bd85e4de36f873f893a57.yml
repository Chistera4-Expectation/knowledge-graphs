  Although Italian Seasoning and Old Bay Seasoning may seem similar because they are
  both pre-mixed spice blends used for flavoring food, they contain different ingredients
  and are associated with distinct culinary traditions. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Italian Seasoning typically consists of herbs such as basil, oregano, rosemary,
  thyme, and marjoram that are commonly used in Italian cuisine. On the other hand,
  Old Bay Seasoning is a blend of herbs and spices including celery salt, paprika,
  black pepper, red pepper flakes, bay leaves, and mustard seeds that is often used
  in seafood dishes from the Chesapeake region of the United States.


  Therefore, while there may be some overlap in their use cases, these two seasonings
  have unique compositions and cultural associations that warrant treating them as
  separate entities.'
