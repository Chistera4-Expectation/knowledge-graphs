text: No, 'Acacia Honey' and 'Tupelo Honey' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of honey, they are derived
  from different plant sources, which impacts their flavor, color, and nutritional
  composition. Acacia Honey comes from the nectar of Acacia flowers, while Tupelo
  Honey is produced from the nectar of Tupelo trees. As dieticians, it is essential
  to recognize and differentiate between these unique honey varieties.
