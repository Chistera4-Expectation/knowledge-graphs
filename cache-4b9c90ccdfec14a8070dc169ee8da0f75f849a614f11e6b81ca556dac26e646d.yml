  While both saturated fats and trans fats are types of fat, they have different impacts
  on health and are not considered semantic or ontological duplicates. Saturated fats
  mainly come from animal products and tropical oils and can raise LDL (bad) cholesterol
  levels, increasing the risk of heart disease when consumed in excess. Trans fats,
  often found in processed foods, are even more harmful to health than saturated fats
  because they increase LDL cholesterol while also lowering HDL (good) cholesterol,
  significantly raising the risk of heart disease. It is essential to track these
  two nutrients separately for proper nutrition analysis and recommendations.'
