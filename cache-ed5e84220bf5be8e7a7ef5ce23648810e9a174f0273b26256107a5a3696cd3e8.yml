text: ' No. Spinach and baby spinach are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they come from the same plant species (Spinacia oleracea). They have
  different physical characteristics, growth stages, tastes, textures, and uses in
  culinary applications. Therefore, it is essential to treat them as separate entities
  in a dietary context. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions
  between these two related but distinct edible vegetables.'
