  While balsamic vinegar and sherry vinegar may have some similarities as types of
  wine vinegars used for flavoring food, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They come from different geographical regions (Italy vs. Spain), made from different
  base wines (grape must for balsamic versus sherry wine for sherry vinegar) using
  distinct aging processes that impart unique flavors and characteristics to each
  type. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate entities with their
  own specific properties and uses in cooking.'
