  Old Bay seasoning and Taco Seasoning are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  because they have different ingredients, uses, and flavor profiles. Old Bay seasoning
  is typically made with herbs and spices such as celery salt, paprika, black pepper,
  and red pepper flakes, and it is commonly used to add flavor to seafood dishes like
  crab cakes and shrimp. On the other hand, taco seasoning usually contains chili
  powder, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and oregano, and it is used to season
  meat for tacos, burritos, and other Mexican-inspired dishes. Therefore, these two
  types of seasonings serve distinct culinary purposes and cannot be considered duplicates.'
