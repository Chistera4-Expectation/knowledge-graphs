text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both are yogurt, they have distinct characteristics and uses. Bulgarian yogurt typically
  refers to a specific type of yogurt made with Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which has
  a distinct tangy flavor. Drinkable yogurt, on the other hand, refers to yogurt that
  has been thinned down to a drinkable consistency, and can be made from a variety
  of yogurt types. These differences in flavor and texture make them distinct entities
  within the yogurt class.
