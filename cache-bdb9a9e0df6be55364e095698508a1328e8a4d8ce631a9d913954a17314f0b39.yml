  While brown rice and long-grain white rice may have some similarities, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates. They belong to the same general category
  of food (rice), but they differ in terms of their nutritional content, taste, texture,
  culinary uses, and cultural significance. For example, brown rice is generally considered
  healthier than white rice due to its higher fiber and nutrient content; it also
  has a nuttier flavor and chewier texture compared to white rice. On the other hand,
  long-grain white rice has a lighter, fluffier texture that makes it suitable for
  certain dishes such as pilafs or stir-fries. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two concepts into one instance in a knowledge graph or database.'
