text: No, 'Eucalyptus Honey' and 'Linden Honey' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the category of honey, they
  are distinct types of honey with unique characteristics, flavors, and properties.
  They should be considered as separate entities in a dietician's classification system.
