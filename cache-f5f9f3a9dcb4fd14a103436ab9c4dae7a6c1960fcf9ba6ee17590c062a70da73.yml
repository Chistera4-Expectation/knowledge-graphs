text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of sauces with
  distinct ingredients and uses. Chimichurri sauce is an Argentinean sauce made with
  parsley, garlic, olive oil, and vinegar, while sour sauce is a sweet and sour sauce
  typically used in Asian cuisine. Although they may share some similarities, they
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
