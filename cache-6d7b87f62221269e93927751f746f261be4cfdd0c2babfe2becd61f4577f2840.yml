  The two instances, "Butter, melted" and "Herb butter," are not identical in their
  composition or meaning, even though they share some similarities. Melted butter
  is a physical state of butter that has been heated to a liquid form, whereas herb
  butter refers to a type of butter that has been flavored with herbs such as garlic,
  chives, or parsley. They have different culinary uses and purposes, so it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
