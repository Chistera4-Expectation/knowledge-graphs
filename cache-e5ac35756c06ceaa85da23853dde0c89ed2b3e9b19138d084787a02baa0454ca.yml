text: No, "Ostrich Nuggets" and "Ostrich Thighs" should not be merged together as
  they are not semantic and ontological duplicates. Although they both come from ostriches,
  they are different cuts of meat with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary
  uses. Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived
  foods available.
