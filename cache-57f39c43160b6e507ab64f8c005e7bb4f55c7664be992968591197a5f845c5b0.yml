text: ' No, black-eyed peas and green peas are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they both belong to the legume family and can be classified under the broader
  category of "peas," they have distinct nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and
  botanical characteristics. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate in
  a dietetic context.'
