text: No, they should not be merged. Chinese Broccoli (Gai Lan) and Vegetable Broth
  are different entities within the Edible Vegetable class. Chinese Broccoli is a
  specific type of vegetable, while Vegetable Broth is a liquid made from cooking
  vegetables, which can include Chinese Broccoli but also other vegetables. They are
  related, but not duplicates.
