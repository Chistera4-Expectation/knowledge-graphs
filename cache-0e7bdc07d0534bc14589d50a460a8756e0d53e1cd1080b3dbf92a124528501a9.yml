text: No, the instances 'Kiwi Seeds' and 'Seeds' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontological duplicates. While both are related to seeds, 'Kiwi Seeds'
  specifically refers to the seeds found in kiwifruit, whereas 'Seeds' is a more general
  term that can encompass a wide variety of seeds from different plants and fruits.
