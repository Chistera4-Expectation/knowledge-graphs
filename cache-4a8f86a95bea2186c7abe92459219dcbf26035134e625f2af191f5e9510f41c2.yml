text: No, 'Ostrich Drumsticks' and 'Ostrich Tenders' should not be merged as they
  are different parts of the ostrich meat with distinct characteristics. While they
  both come from poultry, the cut and properties of the meat are different, making
  them unique instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
