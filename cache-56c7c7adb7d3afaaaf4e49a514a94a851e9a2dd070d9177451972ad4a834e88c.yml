text: No, Hydrogen Water and Oxygenated Water should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both involve adding additional molecules to water,
  they have distinct chemical compositions and properties. Hydrogen Water is water
  with added hydrogen molecules, while Oxygenated Water is water with added oxygen
  molecules. These differences result in different effects and benefits for each type
  of water.
