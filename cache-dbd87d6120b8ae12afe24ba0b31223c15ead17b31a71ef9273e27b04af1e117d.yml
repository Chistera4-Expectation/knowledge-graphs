text: As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on the nutritional aspects of milk
  and hemp milk. Although both are considered milk alternatives, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles. Therefore, I would not recommend merging 'Hemp Milk' and 'Milk'
  instances as semantic and ontologic duplicates, as they have different nutritional
  compositions and may serve different dietary needs.
