text: ' "Dairy" would be the most appropriate broad class for sour cream, as it includes
  other similar foods such as butter, cheese, milk, and yogurt. However, if you are
  looking for a more specific classification within the dairy group, sour cream is
  often classified as a "fermented dairy product," along with foods like yogurt and
  some cheeses.'
