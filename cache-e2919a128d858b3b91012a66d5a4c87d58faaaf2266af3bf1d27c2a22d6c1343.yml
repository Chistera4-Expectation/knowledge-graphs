text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Black pepper
  and red pepper flakes are different spices, with distinct flavors, appearances,
  and uses in cooking. Black pepper is made from dried peppercorns, while red pepper
  flakes are made from dried and crushed red chili peppers. Although they are both
  spices, they serve different purposes in culinary applications.
