text: No, they should not be merged together. "Pheasant Stock" and "Pheasant" are
  distinct instances within the Poultry-derived Food class. While both are derived
  from poultry, "Pheasant Stock" refers to the liquid obtained from cooking pheasant,
  and "Pheasant" refers to the poultry itself. They serve different purposes in a
  diet and require separate entries in a food database or ontology.
