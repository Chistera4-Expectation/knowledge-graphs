  The instances "Chicken" and "chicken sausages" are not exact duplicates because
  they have different forms and textures, even though they come from the same animal
  source. Chicken refers to the meat of the bird, while chicken sausage is a processed
  food product made from ground chicken meat mixed with other ingredients like seasonings,
  fillers, and preservatives, then stuffed into a casing. They belong to the same
  category but are distinct entities that can be differentiated in various aspects
  such as nutritional content, culinary uses, and sensory characteristics. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate rather than merging them as duplicates.'
