  While chicken breast is a cut of poultry that can be used to make dishes such as
  chicken parmesan, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Chicken breast
  refers specifically to the lean muscle tissue found on the underside of a chicken,
  while chicken parmesan is a specific dish made with breaded chicken breasts, tomato
  sauce, and melted cheese. Therefore, these two concepts have distinct meanings and
  uses, and should not be merged.'
