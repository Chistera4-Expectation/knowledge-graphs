text: No, "Quail Broth" and "Quail Thighs" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from quails, they are distinct
  food items with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Merging them together
  would not accurately represent the variety of poultry-derived foods available.
