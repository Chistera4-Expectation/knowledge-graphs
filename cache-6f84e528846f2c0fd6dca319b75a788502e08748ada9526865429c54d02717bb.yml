text: No, they should not be merged as they have different properties and uses. Clarified
  butter is butter that has had its milk solids removed, resulting in a longer shelf
  life and higher smoke point. European-style butter, on the other hand, has a higher
  butterfat content and is often considered more flavorful. These differences make
  them distinct instances in the Butter class.
