text: ' No. While both "calories per serving" and "serving size of the cheese" are
  related to nutrition and portion control, they represent distinct pieces of information
  that describe different aspects of a cheese product. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Keeping these attributes separate
  allows for more precise nutritional analysis and clearer communication about food
  products.'
