text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both are derived from chicken,
  they have distinct nutritional profiles and uses. Chicken broth is a liquid made
  by boiling chicken with vegetables and spices, while "Chicken" typically refers
  to the meat from a chicken. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences
  in their nutritional values and culinary applications.
