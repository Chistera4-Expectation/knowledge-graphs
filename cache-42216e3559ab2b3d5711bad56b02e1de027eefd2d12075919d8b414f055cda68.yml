text: As a dietician, I would say that while both Hedgehog Mushroom and Mushrooms
  in general are edible fungi, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. They
  belong to different species, with Hedgehog Mushroom (Hydnum repandum) being a specific
  type of edible mushroom, while 'Mushrooms' is a broader term encompassing many different
  species. Therefore, the answer is no, they should not be merged together as duplicates.
