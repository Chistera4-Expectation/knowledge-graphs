text: 'As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional content and food
  groups, but the decision to merge or not merge instances in a specific ontology
  is not within my professional scope. However, I can give some insights into the
  food items:


  While both Italian sausage and pork sausage are derived from pork, they may have
  different ingredients, seasonings, and preparation methods. Therefore, it might
  be useful to keep them separate in an ontology for food items. However, the final
  decision depends on the purpose and context of the ontology.'
