  While both Acacia honey and Cherry Blossom honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their botanical origins, taste, color, and other properties.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. It is important to maintain separate categories for these unique varieties
  of honey to ensure accurate labeling, classification, and differentiation for consumers
  and food industry professionals alike.'
