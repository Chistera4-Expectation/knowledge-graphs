text: ' No. Although fresh cilantro (also known as coriander) and fresh parsley are
  similar in that they are both herbs used for flavoring food, they have distinct
  tastes, appearances, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
