text: ' No. While both chicken wings and chicken are types of poultry, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates because they refer to different cuts of meat
  with distinct nutritional profiles. Chicken refers to the whole animal or its parts
  (such as breasts, thighs, drumsticks), while chicken wings specifically refer to
  the wing portion of the bird. Therefore, it is important to maintain separate entries
  for each instance to provide accurate information about their unique nutritional
  content and culinary uses.'
