text: ' Game meats, which refer to meat from animals that are hunted in the wild rather
  than raised on farms, can be classified as a separate category due to their unique
  nutritional profiles. However, if we must compare them with more traditional types
  of meat such as beef, pork-derived food, and poultry-derived food, game meats would
  likely fall into the same class as poultry-derived food in terms of leanness and
  lower calorie content. This is because game meats like venison, bison, and rabbit
  tend to have less fat and fewer calories compared to beef and some cuts of pork.
  Therefore, a concise class name could be "Leans."'
