text: No, the instances 'Mole sauce' and 'Sauce' should not be merged together as
  they have different characteristics. 'Mole sauce' is a specific type of sauce, while
  'Sauce' is a more general term encompassing various types of sauces. Merging them
  would result in the loss of specificity and potentially cause confusion.
