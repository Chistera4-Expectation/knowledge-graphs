text: ' No. While "Hot sauce" may be a type of "Sauce," they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Semantically, they have different meanings, and ontologically, they
  represent distinct categories within the hierarchy of sauces. Merging them would
  result in loss of information and could lead to confusion.'
