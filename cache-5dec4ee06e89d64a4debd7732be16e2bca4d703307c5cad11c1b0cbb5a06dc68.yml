text: ' No. While both Citrus Ginger Dressing and Teriyaki Dressing may contain citrus
  ingredients and share some similarities in taste, they are distinct types of dressings
  with unique flavor profiles and ingredient lists that include different seasonings
  and sauces beyond just citrus and ginger (teriyaki sauce is made from soy sauce,
  sugar, garlic, and ginger among other things). Therefore, they cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates.'
