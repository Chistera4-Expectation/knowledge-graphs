text: As a dietician, I would not merge 'Dark soy sauce' and 'Scotch bonnet pepper
  sauce' together, as they are distinctly different condiments. Dark soy sauce is
  a type of soy sauce with a thicker consistency and darker color, while Scotch bonnet
  pepper sauce is a hot sauce made from Scotch bonnet peppers. They serve different
  purposes in cooking and have unique flavors, making them non-duplicates.
