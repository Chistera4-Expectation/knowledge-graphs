  While both "Browned butter" and "Garlic butter" are types of butter, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their flavor profiles and uses in cooking. Browned butter
  has a nutty, caramel-like flavor and is often used as a spread or in baking, while
  garlic butter has a strong savory flavor and is commonly used in sauces, marinades,
  and stir-fries. They can be considered as two different entities in the Butter class.'
