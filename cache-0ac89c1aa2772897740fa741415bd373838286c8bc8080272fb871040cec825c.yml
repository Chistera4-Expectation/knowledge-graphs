  While hemp seeds and poppy seeds may both fall under the broader category of "edible
  seeds," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They come from different
  plants (hemp vs opium poppy), have distinct nutritional profiles, uses, and cultural
  significance. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions between
  these two unique seed types.'
