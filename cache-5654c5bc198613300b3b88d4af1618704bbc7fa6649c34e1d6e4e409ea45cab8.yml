text: No, Assam Tea and Chai Tea should not be merged together as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although both are types of tea, they differ in origin and flavor profiles.
  Assam Tea is a black tea from the Assam region in India, while Chai Tea is a spiced
  milk tea commonly found in India and other South Asian countries. They have distinct
  characteristics and should be treated as separate entities.
