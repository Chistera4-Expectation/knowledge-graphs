  Although both are derived from quails, "Quail Patties" and "Quail Tenders" refer
  to different food preparations. "Quail Patties" likely refers to a ground quail
  mixture formed into patties, while "Quail Tenders" likely refers to strips of quail
  meat. The difference in preparation and presentation justifies the distinction between
  the two instances.
