text: No, Glutinous Rice and Sushi Rice should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both belong to the Rice class, they have
  distinct properties and uses. Glutinous Rice has a higher starch content and is
  sticky when cooked, while Sushi Rice is a short-grain rice that is seasoned with
  vinegar, sugar, and salt for use in sushi dishes.
