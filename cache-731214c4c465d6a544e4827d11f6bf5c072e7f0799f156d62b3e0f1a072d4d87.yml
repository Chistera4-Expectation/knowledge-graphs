text: No, the instances 'Artisanal Water' and 'Hard Water' should not be merged as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of drinking water, they
  have distinct characteristics and properties. Artisanal water typically refers to
  water sourced from a natural spring or well, while hard water has a high mineral
  content, particularly calcium and magnesium. Merging these two instances would not
  accurately represent the differences between the two types of water.
