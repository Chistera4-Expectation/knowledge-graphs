text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Pheasant Gizzards" and "Pheasant
  Stock" are derived from poultry (pheasant), they are distinct food items with different
  nutritional and culinary properties. "Pheasant Gizzards" refers to the muscular
  stomach of a pheasant, which is typically consumed as a meat source, while "Pheasant
  Stock" is a liquid broth made by simmering pheasant bones, meat, and other ingredients
  to extract their flavors and nutrients. These two food items are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates and serve different purposes in the context of dietetics
  and culinary applications.
