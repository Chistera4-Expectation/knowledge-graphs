  While both avocado oil and palm oil are vegetable oils that can be used for cooking,
  they have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, sources,
  and production methods. Avocado oil is high in monounsaturated fats, vitamin E,
  and other antioxidants, while palm oil has a higher saturated fat content and is
  often criticized for its environmental impact due to deforestation associated with
  its cultivation. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts
  as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
