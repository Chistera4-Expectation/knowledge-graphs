text: No, the instances "Australian Yogurt" and "Yogurt" should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both represent yogurt products,
  they have different attributes and characteristics that differentiate them. Australian
  Yogurt, for example, may have specific ingredients or flavors unique to its country
  of origin. Merging these instances would not accurately represent the differences
  between the two types of yogurt.
