text: ' "Sweetener" would be the most adequate class for Humectants. A humectant is
  a type of ingredient that helps retain moisture, and many sweeteners such as honey,
  corn syrup, and agave nectar have humectant properties. While some food dressings,
  seasonings, sauces, and spices may contain humectants, they are not primarily known
  or classified as humectants in the same way that sweeteners are.'
