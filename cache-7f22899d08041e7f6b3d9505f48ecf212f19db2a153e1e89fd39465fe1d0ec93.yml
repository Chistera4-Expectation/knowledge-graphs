text: ' No. While chili pepper is a general category of capsicum fruits that includes
  scotch bonnet peppers, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Scotch bonnet
  peppers have unique characteristics such as specific flavor profiles, shapes, sizes,
  and heat levels (measured on the Scoville scale) that distinguish them from other
  types of chili peppers. Therefore, it is important to maintain their separate identities
  within a well-structured culinary classification system.'
