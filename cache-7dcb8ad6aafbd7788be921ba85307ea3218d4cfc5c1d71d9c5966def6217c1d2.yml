text: ' No. While both "how often an individual is drinking water throughout the day"
  and "sports drinks" are related to hydration, they represent different concepts
  and cannot be considered semantic or ontological duplicates. The former refers to
  the frequency of consuming plain water, while the latter pertains to a specific
  type of beverage that often contains carbohydrates, electrolytes, and flavorings,
  intended for consumption during exercise or when an individual needs to replenish
  fluids quickly.'
