text: No, they should not be merged together as they represent different poultry-derived
  food items. Pheasant Stock refers to a liquid obtained from simmering pheasant bones,
  meat, and aromatics, while Pheasant Wings refer to the actual poultry wings of the
  pheasant bird. These are distinct food items and should be treated as separate entities
  in a food classification system.
