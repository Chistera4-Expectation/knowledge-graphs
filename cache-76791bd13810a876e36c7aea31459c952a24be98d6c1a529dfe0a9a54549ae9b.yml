text: No, Fructose and Lactose should not be merged together as they are different
  types of sweeteners with distinct chemical structures, properties, and origins.
  Fructose is a simple sugar found in fruits and vegetables, while lactose is a disaccharide
  found in milk and dairy products. They have different nutritional profiles and effects
  on the body, so it is appropriate to keep them as separate instances in the Sweetener
  class.
