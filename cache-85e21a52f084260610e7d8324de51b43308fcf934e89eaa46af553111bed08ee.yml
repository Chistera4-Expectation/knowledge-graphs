text: No, "Lactose-free milk" and "Milk" should not be merged together as they have
  different properties and uses. Lactose-free milk is a variation of milk that has
  had the lactose removed or altered to make it more digestible for individuals with
  lactose intolerance. They are still distinct items in the milk class, despite sharing
  some similarities.
