  Baking powder and garlic powder are not semantic or ontological duplicates, despite
  having similar names that include the word "powder." They serve different purposes
  in cooking and have distinct ingredients and properties. Baking powder is a chemical
  leavening agent used to make baked goods rise, while garlic powder is a seasoning
  made from ground dehydrated garlic cloves, commonly used for adding flavor to dishes.
  Therefore, they should remain separate instances within the Food Seasoning class.'
