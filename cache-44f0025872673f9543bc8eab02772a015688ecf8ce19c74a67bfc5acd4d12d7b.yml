text: No, they should not be merged. Although both 'Sheep's Milk' and 'Whole Milk'
  are types of milk, they are distinct in their sources and characteristics. Sheep's
  milk comes from sheep, while whole milk comes from cows. They have different nutritional
  profiles, flavor profiles, and uses in various food products. Merging them would
  not accurately represent these differences.
