text: ' The most adequate class for Piri Piri sauce would be "Food Seasoning." This
  is because Piri Piri sauce is typically used as a condiment or seasoning to add
  flavor to various dishes, rather than being the main component of a meal. Other
  options such as "Sauce" could also work, but "Food Seasoning" is likely the most
  specific and accurate category for this product.'
