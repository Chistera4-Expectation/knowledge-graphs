text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of pasta, they
  serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Fresh noodles are typically
  used in dishes like spaghetti, fettuccine, and linguine, while lasagna noodles are
  specifically designed for layering in a lasagna dish. Merging them together would
  not accurately represent the distinctions between these pasta types.
