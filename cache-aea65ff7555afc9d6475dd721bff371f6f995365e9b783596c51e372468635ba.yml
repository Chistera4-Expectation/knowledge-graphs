text: No, Papaya Seeds and Sesame Seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible seeds, they have distinct
  characteristics, nutritional values, and uses in cooking and other applications.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the differences between these two types
  of seeds.
