text: No, Black Rice and White Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are different types of rice with distinct nutritional
  profiles, textures, and culinary uses. Merging them would result in loss of important
  information and could lead to confusion for those seeking dietary advice.
