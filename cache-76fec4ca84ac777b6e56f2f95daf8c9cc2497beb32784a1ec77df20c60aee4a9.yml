text: No, Macadamia Nut Oil and Peanut Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct properties, flavors, and uses. Macadamia Nut Oil has a high smoke point
  and a mild, buttery flavor, while Peanut Oil has a nutty flavor and is commonly
  used in Asian and African cuisines. They are not duplicates of each other in terms
  of their characteristics and applications.
