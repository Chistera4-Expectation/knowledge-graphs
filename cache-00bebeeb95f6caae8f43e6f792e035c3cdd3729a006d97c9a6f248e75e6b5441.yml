text: 'No, Kefir Yogurt and Non-Dairy Yogurt should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the broader category of
  yogurt, they have distinct characteristics:


  1. Kefir Yogurt: This is a fermented milk product that is made using kefir grains.
  It has a tangy, slightly sour taste and contains probiotics. Kefir Yogurt is made
  from dairy milk.


  2. Non-Dairy Yogurt: This type of yogurt is made from plant-based milk alternatives
  such as almond milk, soy milk, or coconut milk. Non-Dairy Yogurt is suitable for
  individuals who are lactose intolerant or have dairy allergies.


  While both types of yogurt share some similarities, they also have distinct differences
  in their composition and ingredients. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates.'
