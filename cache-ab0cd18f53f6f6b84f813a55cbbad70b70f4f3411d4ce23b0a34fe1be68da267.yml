text: As a dietician, I would recommend not merging 'Chia Seeds' and 'Seeds' as separate
  entities. While Chia seeds are a type of seed, they have unique nutritional properties
  and health benefits that differentiate them from other seeds. Therefore, they should
  be treated as distinct instances within the Edible Seeds class.
