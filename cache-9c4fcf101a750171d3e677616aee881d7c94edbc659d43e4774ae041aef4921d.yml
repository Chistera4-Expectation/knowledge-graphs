text: No, Flaxseed Milk and Nut Milk should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of plant-based milk alternatives. Although they share the common characteristic
  of being plant-based, they are derived from different sources (flaxseed and nuts,
  respectively) and have different nutritional profiles. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the variety of plant-based milk options available.
