text: No, Coriander seeds and Cumin seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both seeds used as spices, they have
  distinct flavors, nutritional profiles, and uses in cooking. Therefore, they should
  remain separate instances in the Spice class.
