text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are poultry-derived, they are distinct food items with different nutritional properties
  and preparation methods. Pheasant Gizzards are a specific part of the pheasant,
  whereas 'Pheasant' refers to the entire bird.
