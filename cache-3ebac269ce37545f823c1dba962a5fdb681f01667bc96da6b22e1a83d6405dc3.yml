text: No, 'Barbecue sauce' and 'Chimichurri sauce' should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of sauces, they
  have distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses, and are not considered duplicates
  in the context of a dietary classification system.
