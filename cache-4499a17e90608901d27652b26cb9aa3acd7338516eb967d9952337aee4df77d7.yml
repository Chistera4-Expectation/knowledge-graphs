text: No, 'Macadamia Milk' and 'Pea Milk' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both considered types of plant-based
  milk alternatives, they are derived from different sources (macadamia nuts and peas,
  respectively) and have different nutritional profiles and properties. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate instances within the Milk class.
