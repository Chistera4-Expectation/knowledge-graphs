text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of seaweed, they
  are distinctly different in their culinary uses and preparations. Nori seaweed is
  typically dried and used as a wrap or garnish, while seaweed salad is a specific
  dish made from various types of seaweed mixed with other ingredients and dressed
  with a sauce. They may share some similarities in nutritional content, but their
  culinary identities are unique.
