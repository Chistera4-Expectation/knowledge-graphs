text: ' No. While both fresh basil leaves and other leafy greens are types of vegetables
  and can be used in similar ways in cooking (e.g., as salad ingredients or to add
  flavor to dishes), they have distinct nutritional profiles and flavors. Fresh basil
  leaves are high in antioxidants such as vitamin A and C, while other leafy greens
  like spinach and kale offer different nutrients such as iron and calcium. Additionally,
  basil has a unique taste that is not found in most other leafy greens. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
