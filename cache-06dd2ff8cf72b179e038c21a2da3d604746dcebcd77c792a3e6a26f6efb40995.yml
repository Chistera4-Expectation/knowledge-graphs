text: No, Macadamia Milk and Oat Milk should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. They are distinct types of plant-based milk alternatives,
  each with unique nutritional profiles, ingredients, and manufacturing processes.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent the individual characteristics
  and properties of each type of milk.
