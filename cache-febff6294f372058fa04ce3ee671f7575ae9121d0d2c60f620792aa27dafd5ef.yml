text: ' Poultry-derived Food (specifically, Duck)


  Explanation: Although duck is technically considered a type of poultry, it''s often
  distinguished from other poultry like chicken or turkey due to its unique flavor
  and nutritional profile. However, the main difference between duck and other meats
  in this list lies in their animal origin - ducks are waterfowl while beef comes
  from cattle and pork comes from pigs. Therefore, using "poultry-derived food" with
  a more specific classification such as "duck" would be an accurate yet concise way
  to describe it within this context.'
