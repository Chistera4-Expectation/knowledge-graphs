text: No, "Mascarpone cheese" and "Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese" are not semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are different types of cheese with distinct characteristics,
  such as texture, taste, and production methods. While they both fall under the broader
  category of cheese, they are separate instances within that class.
