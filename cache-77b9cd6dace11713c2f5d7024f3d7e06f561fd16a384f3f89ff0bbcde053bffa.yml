  While both Caesar Dressing and Sesame Ginger Dressing are types of salad dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and textures that make them unique. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they represent different concepts within the domain of food dressings.'
