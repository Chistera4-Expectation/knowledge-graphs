text: As a dietician, my focus would be on the nutritional content and ingredients
  of the sauces rather than their classification as duplicates. However, from a semantic
  and ontologic perspective, if 'Beurre blanc sauce' and 'Pesto sauce' share the same
  properties and definitions, they can be considered duplicates. It's essential to
  consider the context of the discussion and the specific classification system being
  used when making such a determination.
