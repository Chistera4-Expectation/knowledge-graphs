text: ' The most adequate class for "beef back ribs" would be "Beef." This is because
  beef back ribs are a type of meat that comes from cattle, and the category "Beef"
  encompasses all cuts of meat derived from cows. While there may be other food categories
  that could potentially include beef back ribs (such as "Pork-derived Food," "Poultry-derived
  Food," or "Edible Meat"), none of these are as specific or accurate as the category
  "Beef."'
