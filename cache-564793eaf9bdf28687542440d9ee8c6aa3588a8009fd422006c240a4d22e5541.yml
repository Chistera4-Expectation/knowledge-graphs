text: ' No. Corned beef and grass-fed beef are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They refer to different types of beef products with distinct preparation methods
  and nutritional profiles. Corned beef is typically made from brisket that has been
  preserved through salt curing, while grass-fed beef refers to cattle raised on a
  diet primarily consisting of grass, resulting in differences in taste, texture,
  and fat composition between the two. Therefore, they should remain separate instances
  within the Beef class.'
