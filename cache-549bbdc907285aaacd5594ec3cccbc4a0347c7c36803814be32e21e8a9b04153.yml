  Although they are both types of pepper, they have different flavor profiles and
  uses in cooking. Ground black pepper has a strong, spicy flavor and is used in a
  variety of dishes, while white pepper has a milder, earthier flavor and is often
  used in light-colored dishes where black pepper would be visually unappealing. Therefore,
  they should be kept as separate instances.
