text: No, Chicken Gravy and Chicken Patties should not be merged as they are different
  types of poultry-derived food. Chicken Gravy is a sauce made from chicken stock,
  while Chicken Patties are formed and cooked chicken meat, often shaped into patties
  for easy consumption. They serve different purposes in a meal and have distinct
  nutritional profiles.
