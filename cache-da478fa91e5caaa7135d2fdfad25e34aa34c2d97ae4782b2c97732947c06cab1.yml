text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are sauces, they have distinct
  ingredients, flavors, and uses. Curry sauce is typically made with spices and is
  commonly used in Indian and Southeast Asian cuisine, while marinara sauce is a tomato-based
  sauce used in Italian dishes. They serve different purposes in cooking and have
  unique characteristics.
