text: No, Flaxseed Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, uses, and sources. Flaxseed oil is rich in omega-3
  fatty acids, while wheat germ oil contains high levels of vitamin E and antioxidants.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent the unique characteristics
  and benefits of each oil.
