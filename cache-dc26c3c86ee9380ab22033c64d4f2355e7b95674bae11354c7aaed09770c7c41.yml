text: No, these instances should not be merged as they are different types of poultry-derived
  gravies. Guinea Fowl Gravy is made from guinea fowl, while Quail Gravy is made from
  quail. Although they are both poultry-derived gravies, they are distinct in their
  ingredients and should be treated as separate entities in the ontology.
