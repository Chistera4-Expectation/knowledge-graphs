text: No, "Boneless chicken" and "Chicken Nuggets" should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from chicken, they are
  distinct products with different preparation methods and ingredients. Boneless chicken
  typically refers to chicken breasts or thighs with the bones removed, while chicken
  nuggets are usually breaded or battered and may contain other ingredients in addition
  to chicken.
