  The two teas have different ingredients and preparation methods, resulting in distinct
  flavors and nutritional profiles. Berry Bliss tea is made from a blend of dried
  berries, while Kombucha tea is fermented using a symbiotic culture of bacteria and
  yeast (SCOBY) and contains probiotics. They can be considered separate entities
  in the Tea class.'
