text: No, the instances 'Alfredo sauce' and 'Sauce' should not be merged together
  as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. 'Alfredo sauce' is a specific
  type of sauce, while 'Sauce' is a general term that encompasses various types of
  sauces. Although 'Alfredo sauce' is a type of sauce, they are not the same concept.
