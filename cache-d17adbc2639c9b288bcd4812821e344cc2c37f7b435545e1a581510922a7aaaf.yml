text: No, "Drip Coffee" and "Turkish Coffee" should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of coffee, they have distinct
  preparation methods, taste profiles, and cultural associations. Keeping them as
  separate instances allows for a more accurate representation of the variety within
  the coffee class.
