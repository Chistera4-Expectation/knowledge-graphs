text: ' No. Cherries and elderberries are not semantic or ontological duplicates and
  should not be merged together as they have distinct characteristics, nutritional
  profiles, and uses. While both fruits belong to the larger category of edible fruit,
  they are different species with unique properties that warrant them being treated
  as separate entities within the dietetics domain.'
