  While both "roasted turkey" and "turkey chili" are types of poultry-derived food
  that contain turkey, they have different preparation methods and typically include
  additional ingredients beyond just turkey meat. Roasted turkey refers to cooked
  turkey with seasonings or stuffing, while turkey chili is a dish made by simmering
  ground turkey (or sometimes leftover roasted turkey) along with various beans, vegetables,
  spices, and possibly other meats. Therefore, these two items cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates.'
