text: ' "Natural Sugars" would be the most appropriate category for honey in this
  list. Honey is a natural sweetener produced by honeybees from the nectar of flowers,
  and it contains small amounts of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. However,
  like other sources of added sugars, it should still be consumed in moderation as
  part of a balanced diet due to its high calorie and carbohydrate content.'
