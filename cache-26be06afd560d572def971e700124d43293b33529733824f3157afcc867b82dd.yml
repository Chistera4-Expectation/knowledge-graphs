text: ' No. Corn husks and cornstarch are not duplicate entries. They are two distinct
  entities with different nutritional properties and culinary uses. Corn husks are
  the outer coverings of corn kernels and are commonly used as a natural food additive
  for their fiber content, while cornstarch is a starchy powder extracted from the
  endosperm of the corn kernel, often used as a thickening agent in cooking.'
