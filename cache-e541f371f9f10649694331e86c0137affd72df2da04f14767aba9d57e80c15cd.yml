text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. Although both "Juice" and "Papaya juice"
  are related, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. "Juice" is a general
  term for a beverage made by extracting the liquid from fruits and vegetables, while
  "Papaya juice" is a specific type of juice made from papaya fruit. Merging them
  together would not accurately represent the concept of different types of juices.
