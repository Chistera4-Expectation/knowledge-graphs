text: No, Hemp Seeds and Melon Seeds should not be merged as they have distinct nutritional
  profiles and come from different plant sources. Hemp Seeds come from the Cannabis
  sativa plant, while Melon Seeds come from various melon varieties. They have different
  nutritional compositions and uses, making them separate entities in the Edible Seeds
  class.
