text: No, Clarified Butter and Whipped Butter should not be merged as they have different
  properties and uses in cooking. Clarified butter is butter with the milk solids
  and water removed, leaving pure butterfat. It has a higher smoke point than regular
  butter, making it ideal for high-heat cooking. On the other hand, whipped butter
  is whipped with air to make it lighter and fluffier, which is often used for spreading
  on bread or topping for dishes.
