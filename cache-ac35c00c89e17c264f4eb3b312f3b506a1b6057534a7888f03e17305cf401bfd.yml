text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different cuts of pork with
  distinct characteristics and uses in cooking. Pork Shank is the lower part of the
  leg, while Pork Shoulder is from the upper part of the foreleg. Both have different
  textures, fat content, and cooking methods.
