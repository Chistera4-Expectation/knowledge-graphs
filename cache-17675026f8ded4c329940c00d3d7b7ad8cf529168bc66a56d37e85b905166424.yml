text: ' No. While both Blue Cheese Dressing and Russian Dressing are types of salad
  dressings, they have distinct differences in their ingredients and flavors. Blue
  Cheese Dressing is made with blue cheese, mayonnaise, buttermilk, vinegar, and spices,
  while Russian Dressing contains ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, and
  other seasonings. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates.'
