text: As a dietician, I can provide insights into the nutritional aspects of these
  sauces, but the decision to merge instances in a class depends on the context and
  requirements of the system or application using the class. From a nutritional standpoint,
  Aioli sauce and sour sauce have different ingredients and nutritional profiles,
  so they wouldn't be considered semantic or ontologic duplicates. However, if the
  class is meant to categorize sauces based on similarities in their preparation or
  purpose, it may make sense to merge these instances. Ultimately, the decision depends
  on the purpose of the Sauce class and the specific requirements of the system or
  application using it.
