text: ' No. Spices and tomato slices are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They
  belong to different categories of edible vegetables: spices are usually used in
  small amounts to add flavor to dishes, while tomatoes are typically considered a
  vegetable (though technically a fruit) for their taste and nutritional value when
  consumed in slices. Merging them would result in an incorrect categorization.'
