  While "diced onions" is a specific form of preparation for the vegetable "onion,"
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Dicing is an action that can be
  performed on onions to change their physical state, but it does not change the essential
  nature of the food item itself. Therefore, these two terms refer to related but
  distinct concepts within the domain of edible vegetables.'
