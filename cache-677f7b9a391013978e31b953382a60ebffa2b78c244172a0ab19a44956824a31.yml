text: ' No. Corn oil and grapeseed oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they are both types of edible vegetable oils. They come from different
  plants (corn and grapes, respectively), have different nutritional profiles, and
  are used for different culinary purposes. Therefore, it is important to keep them
  separate when discussing or categorizing edible vegetable oils.'
