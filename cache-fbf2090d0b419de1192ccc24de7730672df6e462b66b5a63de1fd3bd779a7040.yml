  While both black pepper and habanero peppers are types of peppers, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their flavor profile, pungency level, culinary uses, nutritional
  content, and growth characteristics. Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them
  as semantic or ontological duplicates in a spice classification system. They each
  retain unique properties that warrant separate categorization for accurate identification
  and application within recipes and meal planning.'
