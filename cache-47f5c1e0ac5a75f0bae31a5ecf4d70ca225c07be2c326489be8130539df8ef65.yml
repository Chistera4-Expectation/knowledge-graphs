text: No, 'Coconut water' and 'Watermelon juice' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different types of juices with distinct nutritional
  profiles and properties. While they may share some similarities, such as being hydrating,
  they are not the same and should be treated as separate instances in the Juice class.
