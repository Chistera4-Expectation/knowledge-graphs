text: As a dietician, I can provide insight into the nutritional aspects of fruits,
  but I don't have the authority to determine how a specific programming language
  or database structure should handle the classification of fruit names. However,
  from a semantic and ontologic standpoint, 'Peach' and 'Peaches' refer to the same
  fruit species, Prunus persica. Therefore, it could be argued that they are duplicates
  in that context. But, the decision on whether to merge them depends on the specific
  requirements of the programming language or database being used.
