text: No, 'Oxygenated Water' and 'Spring Water' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates because they have different properties and origins. Oxygenated
  Water is water that has been artificially infused with oxygen, while Spring Water
  is naturally occurring water from a spring. They are distinct types of water with
  different characteristics and production processes.
