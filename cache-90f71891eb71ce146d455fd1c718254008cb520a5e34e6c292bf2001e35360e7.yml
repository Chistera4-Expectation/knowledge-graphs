  Flaxseeds (also known as linseeds) and mustard seeds are both types of edible seeds,
  but they have different nutritional profiles, uses, and culinary properties. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.
  Here are some key differences between flaxseeds and mustard seeds:


  * Nutritional profile: Flaxseeds are high in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, protein,
  vitamin B1, manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, and selenium. Mustard seeds contain
  healthy fats, fiber, protein, vitamin B1, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus,
  and zinc. While there is some overlap in their micronutrient content, flaxseeds
  have higher levels of certain minerals like magnesium and phosphorus, while mustard
  seeds have more calcium and iron.

  * Uses: Flaxseeds are often used for baking, smoothies, salads, and yogurt parfaits
  due to their mild flavor and soft texture when ground. They can also be sprouted
  and eaten raw or cooked. In contrast, mustard seeds are commonly used in Indian,
  African, and Mediterranean cuisines for pickling vegetables, making spice blends,
  and adding heat to dishes like curries and stews. Whole mustard seeds can be added
  directly to cooking liquids, whereas ground mustard seed powder provides a stronger,
  sharper taste.

  * Culinary properties: When consumed whole, flaxseeds pass through the digestive
  tract undigested, which means that our bodies cannot absorb all the beneficial compounds
  contained within them. To make the most of their health benefits, it''s best to
  grind flaxseeds before consuming them. On the other hand, mustard seeds release
  pungent volatile oils when crushed or heated, giving dishes a distinctively sharp,
  tangy flavor. The heat from cooking also releases sulfurous compounds that contribute
  to its characteristic aroma and taste.


  In summary, although flaxseeds and mustard seeds belong to the same category of
  foods, they differ significantly in terms of nutrition, use cases, and sensory qualities.
  Merging these two concepts would result in a loss of valuable information about
  each individual food item.'
