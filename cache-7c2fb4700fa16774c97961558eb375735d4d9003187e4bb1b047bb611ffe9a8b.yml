text: ' No. While "carrot" (singular) and "carrots" (plural) refer to the same type
  of vegetable, they are not duplicate entries because they serve different grammatical
  functions in sentences. Merging them would result in incorrect usage depending on
  context. It is important for a classification system like an edible vegetable class
  to include both singular and plural forms to accurately reflect natural language
  use.'
