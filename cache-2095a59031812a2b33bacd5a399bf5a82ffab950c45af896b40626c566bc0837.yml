text: ' No, chicken breasts and chicken broth should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from chickens, they have different
  nutritional profiles and uses in cooking. Chicken breasts are a lean source of protein,
  while chicken broth is primarily liquid with some nutrients and is used to add flavor
  to dishes. Merging them would not accurately reflect their distinct properties and
  roles in a healthy diet.'
