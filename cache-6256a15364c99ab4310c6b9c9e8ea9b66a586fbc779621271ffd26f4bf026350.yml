  While both pieces of information may be related to the nutritional content of the
  juice, they represent distinct concepts and are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  The amount of sugar in a juice pertains to its quantitative nutritional value, while
  the type of juice refers to the categorization based on factors like fruit variety
  or composition (e.g., orange juice, apple juice). Merging these two attributes would
  result in loss of specificity and could lead to confusion when analyzing or comparing
  different juices based on their individual characteristics.'
