text: No, they should not be merged. "Chicken Sausage" and "chicken/vegetable stock"
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They are distinct food items made from
  poultry, but they serve different purposes and have different nutritional profiles.
  Chicken Sausage is a processed meat product, while chicken/vegetable stock is a
  liquid base for cooking that is typically made from simmering chicken and vegetable
  scraps.
