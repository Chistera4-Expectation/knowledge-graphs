text: ' It is difficult to determine the most adequate class for "other preferred
  toppings" based on the given list as it includes various food and beverage items.
  However, if we want to create a general category for toppings that are not specifically
  mentioned in other classes (e.g., sauces, dressings, seasonings), then we could
  consider creating a class called "Toppings - Other." This class would include items
  such as nuts, seeds, croutons, and condiments like ketchup or hot sauce. Alcoholic
  drinks, meat products, dairy products, grains, and fruits are better classified
  under their respective categories.'
