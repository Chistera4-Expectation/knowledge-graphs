text: "As a dietician, my expertise lies in nutrition and not in ontology or semantics.\
  \ However, from a nutritional perspective, white vinegar is a specific type of vinegar,\
  \ typically made from fermented distilled alcohol. It is a more generic term for\
  \ vinegar that could refer to any colorless vinegar, but white vinegar specifically\
  \ refers to vinegar that is clear or pale yellow. \n\nIn a food seasoning class,\
  \ it might be helpful to distinguish between the different types of vinegar, including\
  \ white vinegar, as they can have slightly different tastes and uses in cooking\
  \ and food preparation. Therefore, from a food-related perspective, I would suggest\
  \ not merging 'Vinegar' and 'White vinegar' as they are not exactly the same thing.\
  \ However, as mentioned earlier, the decision on whether to merge them or not would\
  \ depend on the specific context and goals of the class."
