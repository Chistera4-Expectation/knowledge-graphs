  However, in terms of semantics and ontology, if 'Sauce' and 'sour sauce' represent
  the same concept or entity within the context of the Sauce class, then they could
  be considered duplicates. In that case, it would be advisable to merge them to avoid
  redundancy and confusion. However, if 'sour sauce' represents a specific type of
  sauce that is different from other sauces in the class, it should be kept as a separate
  instance. The decision ultimately depends on the intended purpose and structure
  of the Sauce class.
