text: No, "Chicken Broth" and "Chicken Tenders" should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both are derived from chicken, they are different
  food products with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Chicken Broth
  is a liquid made by simmering chicken bones, meat, and vegetables, while Chicken
  Tenders are a specific cut of chicken meat, typically from the breast or thigh,
  which can be cooked in various ways.
