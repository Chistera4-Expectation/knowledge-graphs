text: ' No. Buckwheat honey and fireweed honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. While they are both types of honey, they come from different
  floral sources and have distinct flavor profiles, nutritional content, and other
  properties. Therefore, it is important to maintain them as separate categories.'
