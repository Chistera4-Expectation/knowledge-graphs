text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Oyster crackers' and 'crushed crackers' are types of crackers, they are different
  in their form and usage. Oyster crackers are typically small, round crackers often
  served with soup, while crushed crackers are simply crushed versions of crackers
  that can be used as a topping or ingredient in various dishes. Therefore, they serve
  different purposes and should be considered distinct instances in the Bread class.
