text: ' No. Long-grain rice is a type of rice, but it has distinct characteristics
  that differentiate it from other types of rice (such as short-grain or medium-grain
  rice). Therefore, long-grain rice and rice should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. They are related concepts, with "long-grain rice" being
  a more specific subcategory of the broader category "rice."'
