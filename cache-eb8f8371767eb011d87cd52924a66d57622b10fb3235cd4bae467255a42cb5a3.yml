text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are derived from turkey, they are distinctly different food items. Turkey gizzards
  are a specific part of the turkey (the stomach) and are typically consumed as a
  meat cut, while turkey stock is a liquid made by simmering turkey bones and other
  ingredients to create a flavorful base for soups, sauces, and other dishes. They
  have different nutritional profiles and are used differently in culinary preparations.
