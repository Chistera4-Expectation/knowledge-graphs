text: As a dietician, my answer would be "No." While both 'Beef Balls' and 'Beef'
  are related in the sense that they come from the same animal, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates. 'Beef' refers to the general meat of cattle, while 'Beef
  Balls' refers to a specific dish made with ground beef, typically shaped into small
  spheres. They have different nutritional profiles, preparation methods, and cultural
  significance. Therefore, they should remain separate instances in the Beef class.
