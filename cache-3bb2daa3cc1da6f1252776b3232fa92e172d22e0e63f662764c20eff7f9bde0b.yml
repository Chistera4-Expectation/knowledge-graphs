  While mustard seeds and watermelon seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have
  distinct nutritional profiles, taste, texture, and uses in cooking. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. It
  is important to maintain separate categories for each type of seed so that consumers
  can make informed decisions about their food choices based on specific nutritional
  needs or culinary preferences.'
