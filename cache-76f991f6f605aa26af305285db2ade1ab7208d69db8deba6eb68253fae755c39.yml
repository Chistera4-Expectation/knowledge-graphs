text: No, Spring Water and Tap Water should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they both refer to water sources, they have distinct
  characteristics and sources. Spring Water is naturally filtered through layers of
  rock and soil, while Tap Water is treated and distributed by public water systems.
  These differences can impact their mineral content, safety, and taste, making them
  separate entities in the context of drinking water.
