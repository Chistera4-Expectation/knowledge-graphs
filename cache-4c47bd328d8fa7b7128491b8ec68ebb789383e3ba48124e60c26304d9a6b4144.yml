  "Cooked meat" and "meat" do not refer to the same thing, even though cooked meat
  is one type of meat that has undergone a specific preparation process. Therefore,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Merging them would result in loss
  of important distinctions and information about the state and preparation of the
  food item being discussed. It is essential to maintain these separate terms for
  clarity and accuracy when discussing nutrition and diets with clients.'
