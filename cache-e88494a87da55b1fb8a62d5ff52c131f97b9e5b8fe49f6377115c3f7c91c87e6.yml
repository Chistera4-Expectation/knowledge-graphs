  While both garlic butter and herb butter are types of flavored butters, they have
  distinct differences in terms of their ingredients and uses in cooking. Garlic butter
  typically contains garlic and is used to add a savory, slightly sweet flavor to
  dishes like steak, vegetables, and bread. Herb butter, on the other hand, is made
  with a blend of herbs such as parsley, chives, and thyme, and is often used to add
  a fresh, herby flavor to dishes like fish, poultry, and vegetables.


  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
