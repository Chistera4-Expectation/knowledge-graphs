text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. Although both 'Creamy Yogurt' and 'Low-Fat
  Yogurt' are types of yogurt, they have different nutritional profiles. 'Creamy Yogurt'
  typically has a higher fat content, while 'Low-Fat Yogurt' has a reduced fat content.
  Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
