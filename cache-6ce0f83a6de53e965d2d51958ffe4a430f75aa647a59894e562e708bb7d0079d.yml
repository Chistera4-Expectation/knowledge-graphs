text: ' No. Flaxseeds (also known as linseeds) and grape seeds are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates, as they come from different plant sources (flax plants vs.
  grapes), have distinct nutritional profiles, and serve various purposes in culinary
  applications and health benefits. They can coexist in an "Edible Seeds" class without
  causing confusion or redundancy if properly defined.'
