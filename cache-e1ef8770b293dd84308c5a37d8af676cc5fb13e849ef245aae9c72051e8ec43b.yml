  While both condensed milk and plant-based milks like oat milk can be used as alternatives
  to traditional cow''s milk in some contexts, they are not semantic nor ontological
  duplicates. They have different nutritional profiles, ingredients, and uses in recipes.
  Condensed milk is made by concentrating milk and adding sugar, resulting in a thick,
  sweet product often used in desserts and baking. Plant-based milks, on the other
  hand, are derived from various plants (e.g., oats, almonds, soy) and usually contain
  added vitamins and minerals to resemble dairy milk''s nutritional content. Merging
  these two instances would result in oversimplification and loss of essential distinctions
  between them.'
