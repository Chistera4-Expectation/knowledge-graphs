text: No, Chanterelle Mushroom and Hen of the Woods Mushroom should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible mushrooms,
  they are distinct species with different characteristics, appearances, and culinary
  uses. Chanterelle Mushrooms (Cantharellus cibarius) are bright yellow to orange,
  funnel-shaped, and have a fruity, apricot-like aroma. Hen of the Woods Mushrooms
  (Grifola frondosa) have a fan-like or coral-like appearance, and a mild, earthy
  flavor.
