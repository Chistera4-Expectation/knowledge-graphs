text: No, "Ostrich Eggs" and "Pheasant Eggs" should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates in the Poultry-derived Food class. While both are eggs derived
  from poultry, they come from different species with distinct nutritional profiles
  and culinary uses. Merging them would lead to a loss of specificity and potentially
  incorrect dietary recommendations.
