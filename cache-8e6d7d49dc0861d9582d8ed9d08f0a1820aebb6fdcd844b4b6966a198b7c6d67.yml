text: ' No. In general, ''Tomato'' and ''Tomatoes'' refer to the same entity but with
  different number marking for grammatical context. It is common practice in knowledge
  representation systems like ontologies to treat singular and plural forms of words
  as equivalent rather than merging them into a single concept. This approach allows
  the system to handle both singular and plural forms naturally within natural language
  processing applications while maintaining clear distinctions between related concepts.
  Therefore, it is not necessary to merge ''Tomato'' and ''Tomatoes'' as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
