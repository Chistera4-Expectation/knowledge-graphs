text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Ostrich Patties" and "Ostrich
  Stock" are derived from ostriches, they are distinct food items with different properties,
  uses, and preparation methods. "Ostrich Patties" are typically ground meat patties,
  while "Ostrich Stock" refers to a liquid made from simmering ostrich bones, meat,
  or vegetables. These differences make them unique instances in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
