  While both pork tenderloin and roasted pork are types of pork, they refer to different
  cuts and preparations of the meat. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge
  them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Pork tenderloin is a specific cut of meat that comes from the muscle that runs along
  the backbone of the pig, while roasted pork can refer to any type of pork that has
  been cooked by roasting, including various cuts such as loin, shoulder, or butt.
  So, despite being related, these two terms have distinct meanings within the context
  of pork-derived foods.'
