text: No, they should not be merged together as they are not semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they both belong to the class of edible mushrooms and are often
  used interchangeably in culinary contexts, they are two distinct species of mushrooms.
  Wood ear mushrooms refer to the species Auricularia polytricha, while cloud ear
  fungus refers to the species Auricularia auricula-judae. They have different appearances,
  textures, and flavors, and can be used in different culinary applications.
