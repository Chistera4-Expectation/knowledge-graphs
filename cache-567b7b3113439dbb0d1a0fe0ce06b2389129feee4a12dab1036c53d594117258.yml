text: No, they should not be merged. Bell peppers and wonton wrappers are distinctly
  different edible vegetables, with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses.
  Bell peppers are a type of fruit (specifically, a type of Capsicum) that are commonly
  eaten as a vegetable, while wonton wrappers are a type of dough used to make Chinese
  dumplings and other dishes. They are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
