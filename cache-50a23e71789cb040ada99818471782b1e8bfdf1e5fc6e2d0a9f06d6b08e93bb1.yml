  While both "Duck confit" and "Peking duck" are dishes that feature duck meat, they
  are different in terms of preparation method and flavor profile. Duck confit is
  a French dish where the duck is slowly cooked in its own fat until tender and then
  crisped up, while Peking duck is a Chinese dish where the duck is roasted over an
  open flame to create a crispy skin. These differences make them distinct entities
  in the Poultry-derived Food class, and therefore they should not be merged as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
