text: No, 'Chicken Gizzards' and 'Duck Gizzards' should not be merged as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they share similarities as gizzards from different
  types of poultry, they still have distinct characteristics, such as taste, nutritional
  values, and culinary uses, which warrant separate entries in the Poultry-derived
  Food class.
