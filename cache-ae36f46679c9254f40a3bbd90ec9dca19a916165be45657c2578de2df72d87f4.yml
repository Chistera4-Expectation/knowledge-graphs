text: As a dietician, my answer would be no. Although quail thighs are a part of quail,
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Quail refers to the entire bird,
  while quail thighs specifically refer to the thigh portion of the bird. They have
  different nutritional values and can be prepared differently in recipes.
