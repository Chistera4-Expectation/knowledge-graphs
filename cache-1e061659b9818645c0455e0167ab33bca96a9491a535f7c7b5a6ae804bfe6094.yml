text: No, "Duck Wings" and "Turkey Wings" should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are poultry-derived food and have similar properties,
  they are still distinct types of poultry and can have different nutritional values,
  flavors, and textures. Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of
  poultry-derived food available.
