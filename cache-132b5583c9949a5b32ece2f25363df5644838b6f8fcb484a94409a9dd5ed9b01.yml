  Buckwheat honey is a type of honey produced from the nectar of buckwheat flowers,
  while honey is a general term that refers to a sweet, sticky substance produced
  by bees from the nectar of flowers. Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, but rather buckwheat honey is a specific kind of honey with distinct
  characteristics and properties.'
