text: No, these instances should not be merged as they have distinct properties and
  uses. Olive oil and sesame oil are different types of edible vegetal oils with unique
  flavors and nutritional profiles. Although they both provide a nutty aroma, their
  characteristics are not identical. Therefore, they should remain separate instances
  in the Edible Vegetal Oil class.
