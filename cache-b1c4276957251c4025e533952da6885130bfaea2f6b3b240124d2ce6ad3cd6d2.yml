text: ' No. While both fresh fish and stock fish are types of edible fish, they refer
  to different stages of preservation and preparation. Fresh fish refers to fish that
  has not been preserved in any way and is intended to be consumed soon after being
  caught. Stock fish, on the other hand, refers to fish that has been dried and salted
  for preservation, typically before being sold and used in cooking. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as they represent distinct
  categories within the domain of edible fish.'
