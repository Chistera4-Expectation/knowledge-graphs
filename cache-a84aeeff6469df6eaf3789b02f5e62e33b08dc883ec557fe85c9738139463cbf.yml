text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Quail Patties' and 'Quail Wings' are derived from poultry (quail), they are different
  food items with distinct preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Merging them
  would not accurately reflect their unique characteristics.
