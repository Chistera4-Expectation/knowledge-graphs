text: ' The most adequate class for peanuts would be "Edible Seeds." Peanuts are technically
  legumes, but in the context of food classification systems they are often grouped
  with seeds due to their similar nutritional profile and uses. Other examples of
  edible seeds include sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and flaxseeds.
  This category is distinct from nuts (such as almonds or walnuts), which come from
  trees rather than being seed plants like peanuts.'
