text: 'As a dietician, I can provide information on the nutritional aspects of tea,
  but the classification and categorization of tea types are more related to botany
  and food science. However, I can offer some information on these types of tea.


  Assam tea is a type of black tea that comes from the Assam region in India. It is
  known for its strong, malty flavor and is often used in breakfast blends. Black
  tea, in general, refers to fully oxidized tea leaves.


  While Assam tea is a type of black tea, not all black teas are Assam tea. Therefore,
  merging ''Assam Tea'' and ''Black Tea'' as semantic and ontologic duplicates would
  not be accurate. They are related but distinct categories within the broader classification
  of tea.'
