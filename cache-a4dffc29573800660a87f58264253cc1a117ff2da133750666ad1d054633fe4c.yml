  While cholesterol and sugar are both substances that can be present in cheese servings,
  they have different nutritional properties and play distinct roles in human health.
  Cholesterol is a fat-like substance found in animal products, including dairy, while
  sugar refers to simple carbohydrates that provide energy but offer little nutritional
  value. Merging these two attributes would not accurately reflect their unique contributions
  to nutrition information. Therefore, it is appropriate for them to remain separate
  as independent instance variables in the "Cheese" class.'
