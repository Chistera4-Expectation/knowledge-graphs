text: No, the instances 'Butter Blend' and 'Grass-fed Butter' should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of butter, they have
  distinct properties and characteristics. Butter Blend refers to a mixture of butter
  and other fats, while Grass-fed Butter is specifically made from milk produced by
  cows that have been fed on grass. These differences in composition and production
  methods make them separate entities in terms of semantics and ontology.
