  While both "seaweed salad" and "wakame seaweed" are related to each other as a dish
  (seaweed salad) containing a specific type of seaweed (wakame), they cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates. This is because they refer to different things:
  one refers to a prepared dish, while the other refers to a particular kind of edible
  seaweed used in various culinary applications. Merging them would result in loss
  of information about their distinct meanings.'
