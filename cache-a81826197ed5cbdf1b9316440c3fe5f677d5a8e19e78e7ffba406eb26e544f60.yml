  While both "Low-Fat Yogurt" and "Vegan Yogurt" are types of yogurt, they are distinct
  based on their nutritional and dietary characteristics. "Low-Fat Yogurt" refers
  to a yogurt with reduced fat content, while "Vegan Yogurt" refers to a yogurt made
  without any animal products. These differences make them unique instances in a yogurt
  class.
