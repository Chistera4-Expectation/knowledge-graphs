text: As a dietician, my answer pertains to the nutritional and dietary aspects. While
  both Blue Crab and Crab belong to the same class of edible crustaceans and share
  similar nutritional profiles, they are not exactly the same species. Blue Crab (Callinectes
  sapidus) is a specific species, while 'Crab' is a more general term that can refer
  to several species within the crustacean group. Therefore, they should not be merged
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. However, from a nutritional standpoint, they
  can be considered similar.
