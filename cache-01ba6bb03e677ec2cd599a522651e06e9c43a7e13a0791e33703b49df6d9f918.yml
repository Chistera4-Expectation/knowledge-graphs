text: ' No. While both Cloves and Ground Cloves refer to the same spice derived from
  the clove tree, they represent different forms of the spice: whole cloves and ground
  cloves respectively. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions
  regarding their uses and properties in recipes.'
