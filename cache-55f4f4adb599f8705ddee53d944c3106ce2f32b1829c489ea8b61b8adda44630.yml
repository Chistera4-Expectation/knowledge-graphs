  While both pork belly and pork ribs are derived from pigs, they are different cuts
  of meat with distinct textures, flavors, and culinary uses. Pork belly is typically
  cured and smoked to make bacon, while pork ribs are often slow-cooked or grilled
  to create a tender, meaty dish. They can be considered separate entities in the
  Pork-derived Food class.'
