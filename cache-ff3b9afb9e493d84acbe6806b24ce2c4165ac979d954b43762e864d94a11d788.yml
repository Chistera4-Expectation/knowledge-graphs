text: No, "Glacier Water" and "Infused Water" should not be merged together as they
  are distinct types of drinking water. Glacier Water refers to water sourced from
  glaciers, while Infused Water refers to water that has been infused with various
  fruits, herbs, or other flavors. They differ in their properties, sources, and preparation
  methods.
