text: ' No. Calcium content per serving and total fat per serving are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates, even though they both provide information about nutritional
  content of cheese servings. They measure different nutrients with distinct health
  implications, so it is important to keep them separate for accurate tracking and
  comparison purposes.'
