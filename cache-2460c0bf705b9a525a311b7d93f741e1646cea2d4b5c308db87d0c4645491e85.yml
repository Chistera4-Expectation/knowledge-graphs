text: No, 'Forbidden Rice' (also known as Black Rice) and 'Glutinous Rice' should
  not be merged together. They are different types of rice with distinct nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking. 'Forbidden Rice' has a higher anthocyanin content,
  while 'Glutinous Rice' has a higher starch content, making it stickier when cooked.
