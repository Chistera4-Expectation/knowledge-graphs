text: No, they should not be merged together as they represent two distinct types
  of edible fish. 'Fish fillet' is a general term for a boneless piece of fish meat
  that can come from various fish species, while 'Flying fish' is a specific type
  of fish with the ability to glide through the air. They have different characteristics,
  nutritional profiles, and uses in recipes.
