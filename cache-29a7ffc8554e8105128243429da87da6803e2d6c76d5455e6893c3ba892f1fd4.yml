text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of tea, they are distinct
  varieties with unique characteristics. Lemon Tea typically refers to a black tea
  infused with lemon flavor, while Rooibos Tea is a caffeine-free herbal tea made
  from the South African red bush plant. Merging them would not accurately represent
  their individual properties.
