text: ' "Edible Fruit, Edible Vegetable, or Edible Seaweed (for banana leaves used
  in food preparation)" would be the most adequate class for banana leaves. However,
  if we are strictly talking about the leaves themselves as a food item, then "Edible
  Seaweed" would be the closest category since they are often consumed whole and have
  similar nutritional properties to seaweed. But it''s important to note that banana
  leaves are typically used for wrapping or cooking other foods rather than being
  eaten directly.'
