text: ' No. While both "vegetable oil" and "walnut oil" are types of edible oils,
  they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they come
  from different plant sources (various vegetables vs walnuts) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles and uses. Merging them would result in loss of important distinctions between
  these two specific oils.'
