text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both Marsala wine and Rum are
  optional ingredients in the Alcoholic Drink class, they serve different purposes
  and contribute unique flavors to the drinks they are used in. Merging them together
  would not accurately represent the distinct properties of each ingredient.
