  While both "Lemon Herb Dressing" and "Poppy Seed Dressing" may fall under the general
  category of "Food Dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they have different ingredients and flavors. Merging them would result in loss of
  important distinctions between these two distinct food items.'
