text: As a dietician, I would advise against merging 'Beef Balls' and 'Thinly sliced
  beef' as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although both instances are derived
  from beef, they are distinctly different in terms of preparation, nutritional content,
  and culinary usage. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences
  between these two types of beef dishes.
