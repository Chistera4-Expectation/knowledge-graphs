text: No, they should not be merged. Dark soy sauce and Marinara sauce are different
  types of sauces with distinct ingredients, uses, and cultural backgrounds. Dark
  soy sauce is a Chinese condiment made from soybeans, while Marinara sauce is an
  Italian sauce primarily made from tomatoes, herbs, and spices. They cannot be considered
  semantic or ontologic duplicates.
