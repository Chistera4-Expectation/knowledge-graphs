text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Greek Coffee
  and Strong Coffee are different types of coffee with unique preparation methods
  and flavors. Greek Coffee is typically brewed using a traditional method, called
  "briki," and has a distinctive texture due to the finely ground coffee and a layer
  of foam on top. Strong Coffee, on the other hand, refers to any coffee with a higher
  concentration of caffeine and a more robust flavor. These two types of coffee are
  distinct and should not be merged as duplicates.
