text: No, 'Date syrup' and 'White sugar' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of sweeteners with distinct nutritional
  profiles and properties. Date syrup is made from dates and contains natural sugars,
  fiber, and various vitamins and minerals. White sugar, on the other hand, is a refined
  sugar made from sugar cane or sugar beet, and it lacks the nutrients found in date
  syrup. They serve different purposes in cooking and baking and are not interchangeable
  in all recipes.
