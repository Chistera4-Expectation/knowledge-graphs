  Grape seeds and sesame seeds are distinct types of edible seeds that differ in their
  nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and sources. While both can provide health
  benefits when consumed, they have unique characteristics that make them non-duplicative
  in terms of semantics and ontology. Therefore, it is appropriate to maintain these
  two categories separate within an "Edible Seeds" class or similar hierarchical structure.'
