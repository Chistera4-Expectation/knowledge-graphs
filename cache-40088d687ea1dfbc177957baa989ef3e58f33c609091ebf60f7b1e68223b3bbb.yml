text: No, Beech Mushroom and Enoki mushrooms should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible mushrooms, they belong to different
  species and have distinct characteristics. Beech Mushroom (Hypsizygus tessulatus)
  and Enoki mushrooms (Flammulina velutipes) have different appearances, tastes, and
  nutritional profiles. Merging them as duplicates would not accurately represent
  their unique qualities.
