text: No, they should not be merged together as they have different properties and
  characteristics. Oxygenated water typically refers to water that has been artificially
  infused with oxygen, while well water refers to water sourced from a well and may
  not necessarily be oxygenated. They can be classified as separate instances in the
  Drinking Water class.
