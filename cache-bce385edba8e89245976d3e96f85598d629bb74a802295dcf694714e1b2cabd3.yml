text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different cuts of pheasant meat
  and would have different nutritional profiles. Pheasant tenders are likely to be
  leaner and have a milder flavor compared to pheasant wings, which may have a higher
  fat content and a richer flavor. Merging them would not accurately represent the
  differences between these two food items.
