text: No, the instances 'Sauce' and 'Teriyaki sauce' should not be merged together
  as they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. 'Sauce' is a general term for
  a liquid, cream, or semi-solid food product, typically used as a condiment, seasoning,
  or accompaniment, while 'Teriyaki sauce' is a specific type of sauce originating
  from Japan, made with soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients.
  They have different properties, ingredients, and uses, so they should remain separate
  instances.
