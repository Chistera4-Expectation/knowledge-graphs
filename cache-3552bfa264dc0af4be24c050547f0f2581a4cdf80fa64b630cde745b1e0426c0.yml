text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are types of yogurt, they
  have distinct characteristics. Fat-Free Yogurt refers to a yogurt with no fat content,
  while Skyr Yogurt is a type of Icelandic yogurt that is high in protein and typically
  strained to achieve a thicker consistency. They are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, as they have different properties and nutritional values.
