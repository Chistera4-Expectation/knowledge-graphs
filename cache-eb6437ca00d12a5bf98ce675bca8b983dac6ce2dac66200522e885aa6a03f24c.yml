text: ' Among the given options, none of them are adequate classes for antioxidants
  as antioxidants are not food additives, dressings, seasonings, sauces, or spices.
  Antioxidants are naturally occurring compounds found in various foods such as fruits,
  vegetables, nuts, and herbs. A more appropriate class would be "Fruits, Vegetables,
  Nuts, and Herbs" or simply "Whole Foods".'
