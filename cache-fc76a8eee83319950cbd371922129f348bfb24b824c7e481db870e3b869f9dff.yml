text: ' No. Barbecue sauce and optional dipping sauce are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates because they do not have the same meaning and purpose. While barbecue
  sauce is a specific type of condiment with a tangy, sweet, and smoky flavor profile
  used for grilling or marinating meats, an optional dipping sauce can refer to any
  type of condiment served on the side for dipping food items. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
