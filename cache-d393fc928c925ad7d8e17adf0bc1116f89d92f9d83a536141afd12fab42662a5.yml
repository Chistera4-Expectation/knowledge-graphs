text: No, Chia Seeds and Papaya Seeds should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of seeds with different nutritional profiles and uses. Chia Seeds come from
  the Salvia hispanica plant and are known for their high omega-3 fatty acid content,
  while Papaya Seeds are the seeds found inside the fruit of the Carica papaya plant
  and are known for their potential health benefits such as aiding digestion and fighting
  parasites. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics
  of each seed type.
