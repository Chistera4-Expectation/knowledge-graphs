  While both raw wildflower honey and tupelo honey are types of honey, they are not
  semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct differences in their
  source, taste, and nutritional profiles. Raw wildflower honey is made from nectar
  collected by bees from various flowers in the wild, resulting in a unique flavor
  that can vary depending on the region and flower sources. Tupelo honey, on the other
  hand, is specifically sourced from the nectar of tupelo trees, primarily found in
  the southeastern United States. This gives tupelo honey a distinctive buttery, slightly
  fruity flavor with a thin consistency. Additionally, tupelo honey has a higher fructose-to-glucose
  ratio than most honeys, making it more resistant to crystallization and slower to
  spoil. Therefore, raw wildflower honey and tupelo honey should not be merged as
  semantic and ontological duplicates.'
