  Although both instances are derived from pheasant, they represent different cuts
  of meat and processing methods. Pheasant Drumsticks are a specific cut of poultry,
  while Pheasant Sausage is a processed meat product made from ground pheasant meat
  and seasonings. They have distinct characteristics and uses in recipes, making them
  separate entities within the Poultry-derived Food class.
