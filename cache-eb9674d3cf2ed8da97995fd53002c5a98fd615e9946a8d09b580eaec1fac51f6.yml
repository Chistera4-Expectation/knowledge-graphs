text: No, Black Trumpet Mushroom and Reishi Mushroom should not be merged together
  as they are two distinct species of mushrooms with different characteristics, nutritional
  values, and uses. They belong to different genera (Craterellus and Ganoderma, respectively)
  and should be treated as separate instances in the Edible Mushrooms class.
