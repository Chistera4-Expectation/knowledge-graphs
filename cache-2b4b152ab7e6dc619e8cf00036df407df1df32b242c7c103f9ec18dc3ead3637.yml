text: No, they should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  Although both are types of sauces, they have distinct ingredients and flavors. Scotch
  bonnet pepper sauce is known for its spicy heat, while tomato sauce is typically
  milder and made from tomatoes. Merging them would not accurately represent the differences
  between the two types of sauces.
