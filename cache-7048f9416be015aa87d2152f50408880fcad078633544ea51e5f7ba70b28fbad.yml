text: No, Safflower Oil and Sunflower Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they share similarities, such as being vegetable oils and originating
  from plants, they have distinct chemical compositions and properties that make them
  unique. Safflower Oil is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, while Sunflower Oil
  contains a higher amount of monounsaturated fatty acids. These differences impact
  their nutritional value and cooking performance, so they should be treated as separate
  entities in a dietician's classification system.
