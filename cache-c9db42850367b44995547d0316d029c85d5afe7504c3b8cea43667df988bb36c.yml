text: No, the instances 'Boiling water' and 'Water for egg wash' should not be merged
  together as they serve different purposes and have distinct properties. Boiling
  water is used for cooking, sterilizing, and making beverages, while water for egg
  wash is specifically used to help breaded or battered foods adhere to a coating
  before cooking.
