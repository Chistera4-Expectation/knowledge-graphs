  While both "Lemon Herb Dressing" and "Russian Dressing" may fall under the general
  category of food dressings, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they have distinct ingredients, flavors, and uses. Lemon Herb Dressing typically
  consists of lemon juice, herbs (such as parsley, dill, or thyme), oil, vinegar,
  and seasonings. In contrast, Russian Dressing is made with a combination of mayonnaise,
  ketchup, pickle relish, onions, horseradish, paprika, salt, and pepper. The two
  dressings serve different purposes in terms of flavor pairing and culinary applications.'
