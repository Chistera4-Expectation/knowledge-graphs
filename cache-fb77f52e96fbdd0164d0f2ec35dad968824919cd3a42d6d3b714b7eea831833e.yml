  While "cooked rice" is a type of prepared rice that can be made from various types
  of raw rice (including long-grain rice), it does not mean that cooked rice and long-grain
  rice are interchangeable terms or synonymous concepts. Cooking methods, water ratios,
  and resulting texture can vary significantly between different types of rice, including
  long-grain rice, which has its unique characteristics even when cooked. Therefore,
  they shouldn''t be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
