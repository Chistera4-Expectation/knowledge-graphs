text: No, Hoisin sauce and Mole sauce should not be merged together as they have distinct
  ingredients, flavors, and uses. Hoisin sauce is a Chinese condiment made from soybeans,
  while Mole sauce is a Mexican sauce made from a variety of ingredients, including
  chili peppers and chocolate. Although both are sauces, they are not semantic or
  ontologic duplicates.
