text: No, Hard Water and Well Water should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both types of water may be found in wells, hard water
  specifically refers to water with a high mineral content, typically calcium and
  magnesium, whereas well water is a more general term referring to water sourced
  from underground aquifers. These two concepts have distinct properties and implications,
  and therefore should not be merged.
