  Dark soy sauce and hot sauce are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have
  different ingredients, flavors, uses, and appearances. Dark soy sauce is made from
  fermented soybeans, wheat, and salt, while hot sauce typically consists of chili
  peppers, vinegar, and seasonings. Merging them would lead to confusion regarding
  their unique characteristics and applications.'
