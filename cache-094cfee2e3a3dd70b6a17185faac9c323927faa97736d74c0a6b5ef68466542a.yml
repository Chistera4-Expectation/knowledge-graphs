  The two instances, "Flavored milk" and "Goat''s milk," are not identical in terms
  of their nutritional content, taste, or production process. Flavored milk is cow''s
  milk that has been altered by adding flavorings such as chocolate, strawberry, or
  vanilla, whereas goat''s milk comes from goats and has distinct nutritional characteristics
  compared to cow''s milk. As a result, they can be considered separate entities rather
  than duplicates.'
