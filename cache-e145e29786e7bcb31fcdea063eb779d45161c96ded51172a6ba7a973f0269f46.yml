text: As a dietician, my answer is focused on the nutrition aspect. From a nutrition
  standpoint, Hollandaise sauce and Sauce could be considered semantic duplicates
  since both refer to a liquid or semi-solid food ingredient used to enhance flavor.
  However, they are not ontologic duplicates as Hollandaise sauce has a specific set
  of ingredients and preparation methods that differentiate it from other sauces.
  Therefore, the answer is "no" as they should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates.
