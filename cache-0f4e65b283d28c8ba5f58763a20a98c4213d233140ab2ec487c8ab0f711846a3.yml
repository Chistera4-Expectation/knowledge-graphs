text: No, they should not be merged together. Low-Fat Yogurt and Probiotic Yogurt
  are different types of yogurt based on their nutritional content and potential health
  benefits. Low-Fat Yogurt refers to the fat content, while Probiotic Yogurt refers
  to the presence of live bacteria cultures that can have a positive impact on gut
  health. These are distinct characteristics that should be kept separate in a classification
  system.
