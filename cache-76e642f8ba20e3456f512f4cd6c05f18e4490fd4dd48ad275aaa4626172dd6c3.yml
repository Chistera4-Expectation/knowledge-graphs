text: ' No. While both fresh fish and swordfish are types of edible fish, they are
  not semantic or ontological duplicates. Fresh fish is a general category that includes
  many different species of fish, while swordfish is a specific type of fish within
  that category. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances.'
