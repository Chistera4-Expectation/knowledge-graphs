text: No, Bulgarian Yogurt and Vegan Yogurt should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they are both types of yogurt, they have distinct
  properties and characteristics that differentiate them from each other. Bulgarian
  Yogurt is traditionally made with specific bacterial cultures and is not vegan,
  as it is made from cow's milk. Vegan Yogurt, on the other hand, is made from plant-based
  alternatives such as soy, coconut, or almond milk and does not contain any animal-derived
  ingredients. Merging these two classes would result in a loss of important information
  and distinctions between the two types of yogurt.
