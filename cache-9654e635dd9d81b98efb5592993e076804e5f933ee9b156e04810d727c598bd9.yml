text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Ceylon Tea
  and English Breakfast Tea are different types of tea with distinct characteristics,
  origins, and flavors. While both are black teas, Ceylon Tea specifically refers
  to tea grown in Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon), while English Breakfast Tea is a blend
  of various black teas typically served with milk and sugar for breakfast. They can
  be considered subclasses or variations within the broader category of black tea
  but are not duplicates.
