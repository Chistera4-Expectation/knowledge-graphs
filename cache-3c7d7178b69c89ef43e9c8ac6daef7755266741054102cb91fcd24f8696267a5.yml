  Although both are derived from chicken, they have different nutritional profiles,
  preparation methods, and purposes in a meal. Chicken gravy is a sauce made from
  the juices and drippings of cooked chicken, while chicken nuggets are small pieces
  of chicken meat that are breaded and fried or baked. They serve different purposes
  in a meal and have distinct nutritional compositions.
