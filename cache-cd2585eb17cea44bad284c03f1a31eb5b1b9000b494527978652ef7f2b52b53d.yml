text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of pasta, they are made
  from different ingredients and have different characteristics. Lasagna noodles are
  made from wheat flour and are typically used in layered dishes, while rice noodles
  are made from rice flour and are used in dishes like stir-fries and soups. Merging
  them would be incorrect from both a semantic and ontological perspective.
