  While both Kashmiri chili powder and turmeric powder are types of spices used in
  cooking, they have distinct properties and uses. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Kashmiri chili powder has a mild heat level with a vibrant red color, making it
  an excellent choice for adding flavor and color to dishes without overwhelming their
  taste. On the other hand, turmeric powder is known for its earthy aroma and bright
  yellow-orange hue. It contains curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory properties,
  making it popular in various health supplements and traditional medicine. Merging
  these two spices would result in a loss of specificity regarding their unique characteristics
  and applications.'
