text: No, they should not be merged. Quail eggs and quail gizzards are two different
  parts of a quail and serve different nutritional purposes. Quail eggs are a source
  of protein, vitamins, and minerals, while quail gizzards are a source of protein
  and iron. They are distinct food items and should be treated as separate instances
  in a Poultry-derived Food class.
