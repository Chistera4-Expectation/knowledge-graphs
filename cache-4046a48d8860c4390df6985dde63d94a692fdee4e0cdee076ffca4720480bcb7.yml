  While both Caesar dressing and Russian dressing are types of salad dressings, they
  have distinct ingredients and flavors that make them unique. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Caesar
  dressing typically contains anchovies, garlic, egg yolk, lemon juice, Worcestershire
  sauce, olive oil, and grated Parmesan cheese, while Russian dressing is usually
  made with mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, horseradish, paprika, and sometimes hot sauce.
  These differences in composition lead to different tastes and textures, so keeping
  these two dressings separate allows for more accurate labeling and choice when selecting
  a salad dressing.'
