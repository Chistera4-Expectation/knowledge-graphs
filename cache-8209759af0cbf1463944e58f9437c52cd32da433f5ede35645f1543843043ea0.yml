  While black pepper and dried red pepper flakes are both types of spices, they have
  different flavors, uses, and chemical compositions. Black pepper is made from ground
  peppercorns and has a sharp, woody flavor, while dried red pepper flakes are made
  from crushed dried red chilies and have a hot, pungent taste. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
