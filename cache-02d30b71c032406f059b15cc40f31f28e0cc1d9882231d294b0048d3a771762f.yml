text: ' No. Olive oil and soybean oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both fall under the category of edible vegetable oils. They have
  different nutritional profiles, tastes, uses, and production methods, making them
  distinct from each other. Merging these two instances would result in loss of specific
  information about each type of oil.'
