text: ' No. While both Crimini and Oyster mushrooms are edible and share some similarities,
  they belong to different species and have distinct differences in terms of their
  appearance, flavor, and nutritional content. Therefore, it is not appropriate to
  merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
