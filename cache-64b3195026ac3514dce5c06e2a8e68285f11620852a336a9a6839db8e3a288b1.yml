  Although both black rice and sushi rice are types of rice, they have different properties
  and uses, so they cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates. Black
  rice is known for its high antioxidant content, while sushi rice has a specific
  sticky texture that makes it ideal for making sushi. Therefore, they serve distinct
  purposes and audiences, justifying their separate identities.'
