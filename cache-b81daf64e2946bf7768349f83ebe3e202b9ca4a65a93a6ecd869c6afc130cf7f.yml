  Explanation: Coconut water is the clear liquid found inside young, green coconuts.
  It is naturally rich in electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium, making
  it a hydrating beverage. Among the given options, the most adequate class for ''Coconut
  water'' would be ''Juice.'' This category typically includes drinks extracted from
  fruits or vegetables, which fits the description of coconut water. However, it''s
  worth noting that some people might argue that coconut water falls into its own
  unique category due to its distinct nutritional profile compared to other fruit
  juices.'
