  While barbecue sauce and hot sauce may both fall under the broader category of sauces,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have distinct ingredients,
  flavors, uses, and cultural associations. Barbecue sauce typically includes tomato,
  vinegar, sugar, and various spices, while hot sauce is usually made with chili peppers,
  vinegar, and salt. Merging them would disregard these important differences.'
