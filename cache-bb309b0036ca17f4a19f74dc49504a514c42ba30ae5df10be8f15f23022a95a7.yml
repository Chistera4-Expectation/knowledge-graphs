text: As a dietician, I can provide input on the nutritional aspects of these sauces,
  but determining if they should be merged together as instances in a programming
  context is beyond my expertise. However, from a food perspective, Brown sauce and
  Sauce are not necessarily duplicates. Brown sauce is a specific type of sauce with
  its own ingredients and flavor profile, whereas "Sauce" is a more general term that
  could refer to any condiment or liquid accompaniment to a dish. For nutritional
  purposes, it would be necessary to analyze the specific ingredients and nutritional
  content of each sauce in question to determine if they can be considered equivalent
  or not.
