text: No, Amaranth Seeds and Watermelon Seeds should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are considered edible seeds, they are distinct
  from each other in terms of their nutritional content, appearance, and culinary
  uses. Therefore, they should be treated as separate entities in the Edible Seeds
  class.
