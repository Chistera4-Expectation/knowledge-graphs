text: No, Flaxseed Milk and Whole Milk should not be merged together as they are distinct
  types of milk with different nutritional profiles and properties. Flaxseed Milk
  is a plant-based milk alternative, while Whole Milk is an animal-based milk derived
  from cows. Merging them would not accurately represent their differences and unique
  characteristics.
