text: ' No. Catfish fillets and sashimi-grade fish are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged together. They refer to different types of fish
  that have distinct characteristics and uses. Catfish fillets come from catfish,
  which are freshwater or saltwater fish with whisker-like barbels around their mouths.
  They can be prepared in various ways but may not always meet the standards for sashimi
  due to differences in texture, taste, and fat content. On the other hand, sashimi-grade
  fish is typically raw fish that has been specifically selected, handled, and prepared
  according to strict quality criteria for consumption raw, often used in Japanese
  cuisine. Examples include tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. Merging these two concepts
  would lead to confusion and loss of essential information regarding each type of
  fish.'
