text: ' No. Corn oil and extra virgin olive oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  despite both being types of edible vegetable oils. They have different nutritional
  profiles, chemical compositions, and culinary uses, making them distinct from one
  another. Merging these two concepts would result in loss of valuable information
  and could lead to confusion.'
