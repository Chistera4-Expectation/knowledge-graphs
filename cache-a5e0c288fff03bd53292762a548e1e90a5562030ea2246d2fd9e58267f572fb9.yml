text: ' ''Edible Seeds'' would be the most appropriate category for seeds, as it specifically
  refers to seeds that are meant for consumption. This category excludes seeds that
  may be present in other foods, such as bread or breakfast cereals, but are not the
  primary ingredient. Additionally, this category focuses on whole seeds rather than
  seed oils, which is covered under ''Edible Vegetable Oil.'''
