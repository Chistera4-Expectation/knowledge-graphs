text: No, Greek Yogurt and Whole Milk Yogurt should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of yogurt, they have distinct differences
  in their nutritional profiles, production methods, and taste characteristics. Greek
  Yogurt is strained to remove much of the liquid whey, resulting in a thicker consistency
  and higher protein content, while Whole Milk Yogurt is made from whole milk and
  retains more of its original fat content. Merging these two types of yogurt would
  not accurately reflect these differences in a dietary context.
