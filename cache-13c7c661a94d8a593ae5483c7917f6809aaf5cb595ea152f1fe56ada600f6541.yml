text: No, "Duck Gizzards" and "Pheasant Gizzards" should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both gizzards derived from
  poultry, they come from different bird species and may have different nutritional
  profiles, culinary uses, and cultural significance. Merging them would not accurately
  reflect these differences.
