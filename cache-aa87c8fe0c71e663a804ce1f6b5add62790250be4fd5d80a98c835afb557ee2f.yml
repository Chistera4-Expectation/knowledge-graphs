text: ' No. Balsamic Vinegar Dressing and Honey Lime Dressing are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates. While they may both be types of dressings, they have distinct
  ingredients and flavors. Balsamic Vinegar Dressing is typically made with balsamic
  vinegar, oil, and various spices, while Honey Lime Dressing is made with honey,
  lime juice, oil, and other seasonings. Therefore, they should not be merged.'
