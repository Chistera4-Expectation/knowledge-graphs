text: No, 'Earl Grey Tea' and 'Rooibos Tea' are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
  They are different types of tea with distinct flavors and origins. Earl Grey Tea
  is a black tea flavored with bergamot oil, while Rooibos Tea is a red tea from South
  Africa with a naturally sweet and nutty flavor. They can be classified as subclasses
  of the broader 'Tea' class, but they should not be merged as duplicates.
