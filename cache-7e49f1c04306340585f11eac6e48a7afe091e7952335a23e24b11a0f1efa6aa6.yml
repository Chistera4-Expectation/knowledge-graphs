text: No, Flying fish and Stockfish should not be merged together as they are different
  types of fish with distinct characteristics. Flying fish are marine fish that can
  glide through the air for short distances, while Stockfish is unsalted fish, typically
  cod, that has been split down the middle, fixed to a pole, and dried. They are not
  semantic or ontologic duplicates.
