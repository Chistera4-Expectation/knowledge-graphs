  While both "Comb Honey" and "Orange Blossom Honey" are types of honey, they are
  not semantic nor ontological duplicates because they refer to different forms and
  sources of honey. Comb Honey is pure, raw honey still contained within the original
  hexagonal wax cells built by honeybees, while Orange Blossom Honey is a type of
  liquid honey produced from nectar collected primarily from orange blossoms.'
