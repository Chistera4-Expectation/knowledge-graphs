  The base ingredient of a sauce and a specific type of sauce (such as hot sauce)
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. While it is possible for a hot sauce
  to have a base ingredient that is also called "hot sauce," this would simply mean
  that there are two entities with the same name, one being a general category of
  sauces and the other being a specific instance within that category.


  Merging these two concepts into a single entity would result in a loss of important
  distinctions between different levels of abstraction and could lead to confusion
  when discussing various types of sauces and their properties. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to keep them separate as distinct classes or concepts.'
