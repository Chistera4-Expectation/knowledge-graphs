  In the context of the Yogurt class, "Flavored yogurt" and "Probiotic yogurt" are
  not necessarily semantic and ontological duplicates. While they share some similarities,
  they have distinct differences in terms of their flavor profiles and health benefits.
  Flavored yogurt refers to yogurt that has been sweetened or flavored with artificial
  or natural ingredients, whereas probiotic yogurt contains live bacteria that can
  provide health benefits such as improved digestion and immune system function. These
  differences justify keeping them as separate instances in the Yogurt class.'
