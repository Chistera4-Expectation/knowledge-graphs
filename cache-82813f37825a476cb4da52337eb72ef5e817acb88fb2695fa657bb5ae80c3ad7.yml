text: ' No. While both "protein per serving" and "total fat per serving" provide information
  about the nutritional content of cheese, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they measure different macronutrients that have distinct roles in human
  health and nutrition. Proteins are essential for growth, repair, and maintenance
  of body tissues, while fats serve as an energy source, help with vitamin absorption,
  and maintain cell membrane structure and function. Therefore, it is important to
  distinguish between these two attributes when describing the nutritional profile
  of cheese.'
