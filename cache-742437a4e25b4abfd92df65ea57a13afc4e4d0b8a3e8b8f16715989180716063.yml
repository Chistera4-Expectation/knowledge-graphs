  The two instances, "Scallion oil" and "Vegetable oil for frying," are not exact
  duplicates. Although they share some similarities, they have different flavors,
  uses, and nutritional profiles. Scallion oil is made from scallions and has a distinctive
  flavor and aroma, whereas vegetable oil is a blend of various oils and may lack
  the same intensity of flavor. Additionally, scallion oil is often used as a seasoning
  or condiment, while vegetable oil is commonly used for deep-frying foods. Therefore,
  it is appropriate to keep them separate in the Edible Vegetable Oil class.'
