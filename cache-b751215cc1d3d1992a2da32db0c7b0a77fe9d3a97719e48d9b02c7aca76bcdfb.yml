text: 'No, the instances ''Feta cheese'' and ''Optional: additional cheese for topping''
  should not be merged as they serve different purposes within the Cheese class. ''Feta
  cheese'' is a specific type of cheese, while ''Optional: additional cheese for topping''
  is a suggestion for an additional cheese that could be used for a different purpose
  (topping). They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.'
