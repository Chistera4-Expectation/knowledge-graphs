  While chicken salad and chicken soup are both poultry-derived foods that contain
  chicken, they have different culinary preparations and consistencies. Chicken salad
  typically consists of chopped or shredded cooked chicken mixed with various ingredients
  such as mayonnaise, celery, onions, and seasonings, served cold or at room temperature.
  In contrast, chicken soup is a liquid dish made by simmering chicken meat and bones
  with vegetables, herbs, and spices to create a broth or stock, which can be served
  clear or with added pieces of chicken and vegetables. Therefore, chicken salad and
  chicken soup cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates.'
