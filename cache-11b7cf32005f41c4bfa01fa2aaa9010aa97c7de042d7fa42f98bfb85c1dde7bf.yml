  While black rice and cooked rice are both types of rice, they have different nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking. Black rice is an unrefined grain that is high in fiber,
  antioxidants, and anthocyanins, while cooked rice (which can be made from various
  types of rice including brown, white, or black) has been processed to remove the
  bran layer and germ, resulting in lower levels of these beneficial compounds. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
