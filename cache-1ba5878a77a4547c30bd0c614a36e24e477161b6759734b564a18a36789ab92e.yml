text: No, Guinea Fowl Eggs and Guinea Fowl Meat should not be merged together as they
  are distinct food items derived from different parts of the same animal. They have
  different nutritional profiles and cooking properties, so they should be treated
  as separate entities in a Poultry-derived Food class.
