  While both "Fish sauce" and "Optional dipping sauce" might contain the word "sauce,"
  they do not refer to the same type of entity and therefore are not semantic nor
  ontological duplicates. Fish sauce is a specific type of condiment made from fermented
  fish, while an optional dipping sauce could be any kind of sauce served on the side
  for dipping food into. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two
  instances in this case.'
