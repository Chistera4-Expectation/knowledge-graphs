text: 'As a dietician, my focus is on the nutritional content and health benefits
  of foods and beverages. From this perspective, ''Kiwi juice'' and ''Peach juice''
  are not semantic or ontologic duplicates, as they are made from different fruits
  and will have different nutritional profiles.


  However, if the question is about merging the two instances in a programming context,
  it would depend on the specific requirements and goals of the program or application.
  If the goal is to simplify the code or reduce redundancy, then merging the two instances
  could be considered. But from a nutritional standpoint, they should be treated as
  separate entities.'
