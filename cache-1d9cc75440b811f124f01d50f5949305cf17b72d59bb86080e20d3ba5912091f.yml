text: No, "Chicken Sausage" and "Chicken Stock" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both are derived from chicken, they are
  distinct food items with different uses and nutritional profiles. Chicken sausage
  is a processed meat product, while chicken stock is a liquid broth made by simmering
  chicken bones, meat, and vegetables. They cannot be considered duplicates in the
  Poultry-derived Food class.
