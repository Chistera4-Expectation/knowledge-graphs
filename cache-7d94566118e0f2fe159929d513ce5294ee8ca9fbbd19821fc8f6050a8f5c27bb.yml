  While acacia honey and blackberry honey are both types of honey, they have distinct
  differences in terms of their source (the type of flower the bees gather nectar
  from) and flavor profile. Acacia honey is known for its mild taste and light color,
  while blackberry honey has a stronger, fruity flavor and darker color. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic or ontological duplicates.'
