  While both Miso paste and Wasabi paste are types of condiments used in Japanese
  cuisine, they have different flavors, textures, and uses in cooking. Miso paste
  is a fermented soybean paste with a rich, savory flavor and thick texture, commonly
  used in soups, sauces, and marinades. Wasabi paste, on the other hand, is made from
  grated wasabi root and has a sharp, pungent flavor and thin consistency, often used
  as a condiment for sushi and sashimi. They can be considered distinct culinary entities
  and therefore should not be merged as duplicates.'
