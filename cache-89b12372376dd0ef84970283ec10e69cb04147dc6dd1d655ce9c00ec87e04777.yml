  While French dressing and Wasabi dressing may both fall under the category of "food
  dressings," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Semantically, they
  have different meanings: French dressing typically refers to a type of vinaigrette
  with specific ingredients such as oil, vinegar, mustard, and spices; while wasabi
  dressing is made with pureed wasabi root and other ingredients like soy sauce and
  mayonnaise, which gives it a distinct taste and appearance compared to French dressing.
  Ontologically, these two types of dressings belong to separate categories based
  on their unique characteristics and uses. Therefore, merging them as duplicates
  would not accurately reflect their differences and could lead to confusion.'
