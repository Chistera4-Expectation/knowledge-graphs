text: Yes, it would be appropriate to merge the instances 'Mint leaves' and 'Mint'
  as semantic and ontological duplicates in a Food Seasoning class, as they both refer
  to the same plant, Mentha, which is used for flavoring in cooking and culinary applications.
  However, it's essential to consider the specific context and purpose of the class,
  as well as any additional information that might differentiate the two instances,
  such as their physical form (leaves vs. powder, for example).
