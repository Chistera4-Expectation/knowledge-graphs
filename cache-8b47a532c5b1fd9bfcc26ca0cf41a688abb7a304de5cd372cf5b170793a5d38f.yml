text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Artisanal Water and Rain
  Water are types of drinking water, they are distinct in their sources and collection
  methods. Artisanal Water typically refers to water collected from natural springs,
  while Rain Water is collected from precipitation. Keeping them as separate instances
  allows for clearer representation of the variety of drinking water sources.
