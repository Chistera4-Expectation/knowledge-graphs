text: ' No. Creamed honey and Tupelo honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. They refer to different types of honey products with distinct
  characteristics. Creamed honey is simply honey that has been whipped until it becomes
  smooth and creamy, while Tupelo honey comes from the nectar of Tupelo trees and
  is prized for its unique flavor profile. Therefore, they belong to separate categories
  and serve different purposes.'
