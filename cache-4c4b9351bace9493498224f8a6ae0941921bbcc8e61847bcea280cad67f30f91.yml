  While both pomegranate seeds and poppy seeds come from plants and can be classified
  under "edible seeds," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have
  different nutritional profiles, uses, appearances, tastes, and origins. Merging
  them would result in loss of important distinctions between these two distinct food
  items.'
