text: As a dietician, my answer would be no, they should not be merged together. Although
  they are both sauces, they have different ingredients, flavors, and cultural origins.
  Pesto sauce is typically made with basil, olive oil, pine nuts, and Parmesan cheese,
  while Teriyaki sauce is made with soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and sometimes ginger
  or garlic. Merging them as duplicates would not accurately represent their unique
  qualities and uses in various dishes.
