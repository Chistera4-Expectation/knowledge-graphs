  The two instances, "Chili peppers" and "Roasted red bell peppers, diced," are not
  exact duplicates. While they both refer to types of peppers, they have different
  characteristics and uses in cooking. Chili peppers are typically used raw and whole,
  while roasted red bell peppers are often used in dishes where a sweeter, milder
  flavor is desired. Additionally, "diced" refers to a specific form of preparation,
  which further distinguishes it from simply "chili peppers." Therefore, they should
  not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
