  While ginger paste and tamarind paste are both food seasonings and may seem similar
  at first glance, they have distinct flavors, uses, and nutritional profiles. Ginger
  paste is made from ground fresh ginger root and has a spicy, pungent flavor often
  used in Asian, Indian, and Middle Eastern cuisines for its aromatic qualities and
  potential health benefits. Tamarind paste, on the other hand, comes from the fruit
  of the tamarind tree and boasts a sweet-sour taste commonly employed in Mexican,
  Thai, Indian, and West African dishes to add depth and tanginess. Merging them as
  semantic and ontological duplicates would not accurately reflect their differences
  and separate identities within the realm of food seasoning.'
