text: ' No. Feta cheese and fresh mozzarella are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they are both types of cheeses. They have different nutritional profiles,
  textures, flavors, production methods, uses in cooking, and cultural significance.
  Therefore, it is important to keep them as separate instances.'
