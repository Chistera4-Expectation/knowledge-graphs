text: No, Macadamia Milk and Sheep's Milk should not be merged together as they are
  different types of milk with distinct origins and nutritional profiles. Macadamia
  Milk is a plant-based milk derived from macadamia nuts, while Sheep's Milk is an
  animal-based milk from sheep. They can coexist within the Milk class as separate
  instances, as they represent unique types of milk.
