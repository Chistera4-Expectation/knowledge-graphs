  Calcium content per serving and trans fat per serving are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates because they represent different nutritional aspects of cheese. Calcium
  is an essential mineral for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth, while
  trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat that can have negative effects on heart
  health when consumed in excess. Therefore, it is important to keep track of both
  values separately to ensure a balanced diet.'
