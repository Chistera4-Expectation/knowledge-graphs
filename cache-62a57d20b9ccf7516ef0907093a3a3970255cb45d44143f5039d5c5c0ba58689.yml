text: ' The most adequate class for eggplant is "Edible Vegetable." Eggplant is a
  type of vegetable that belongs to the nightshade family, and it is consumed as a
  food item. It has various health benefits due to its rich nutrient content, including
  fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Other classes such as alcoholic drink or sweetener
  are not suitable categories for eggplant since they refer to different types of
  food items with distinct purposes and characteristics.'
