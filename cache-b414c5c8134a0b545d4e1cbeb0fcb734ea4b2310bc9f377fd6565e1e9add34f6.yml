text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Bulgarian
  Yogurt and Whole Milk Yogurt are distinct types of yogurt with different properties,
  production methods, and ingredients. Bulgarian Yogurt is a specific type of yogurt
  that contains unique bacterial cultures, while Whole Milk Yogurt refers to yogurt
  made from whole milk. They can be classified together as types of yogurt, but they
  are not duplicates.
