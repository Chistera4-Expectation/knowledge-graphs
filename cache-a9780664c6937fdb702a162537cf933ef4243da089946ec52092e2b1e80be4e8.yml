text: No, Olive Oil and Pistachio Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are edible vegetable oils, they have distinct
  properties, flavors, and uses. Olive oil is a widely used cooking oil, while pistachio
  oil is typically used for dressings and finishing dishes due to its unique flavor
  profile. Merging them together would obscure these differences.
