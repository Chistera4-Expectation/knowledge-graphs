text: No, "Chicken Feet" and "Chicken Thighs" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both come from the same animal, they are
  different parts with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Merging them
  would result in a loss of information and specificity.
