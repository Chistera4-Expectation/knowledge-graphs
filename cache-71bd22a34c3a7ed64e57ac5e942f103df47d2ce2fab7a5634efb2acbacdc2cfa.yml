text: No, Grapeseed Oil and Sunflower Oil should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although they both belong to the Edible Vegetal Oil class, they are
  distinct oils derived from different plant sources (grapes for Grapeseed Oil and
  sunflowers for Sunflower Oil). They have different compositions, nutritional profiles,
  and uses in cooking and other applications.
