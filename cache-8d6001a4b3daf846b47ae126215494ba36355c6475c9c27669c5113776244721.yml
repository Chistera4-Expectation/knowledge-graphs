text: As a dietician, I can provide a perspective on the nutritional aspects of the
  teas, but the decision to merge instances in a class should be based on the specific
  requirements and goals of the classification system being used. In general, if 'Lemon
  Tea' and 'Oolong Tea' share the same attributes and ontology in the context of the
  Tea class, they could be considered as semantic and ontologic duplicates and may
  be merged. However, if they have distinct nutritional properties or cultural significance,
  it might be better to keep them separate within the class.
