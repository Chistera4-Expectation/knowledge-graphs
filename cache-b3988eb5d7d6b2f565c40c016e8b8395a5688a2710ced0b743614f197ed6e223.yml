text: No, the instances 'Guinea Fowl Gravy' and 'Ostrich Gravy' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both gravies made
  from poultry, they are derived from different types of birds (guinea fowl and ostrich)
  and may have different ingredients, flavors, and nutritional profiles.
