text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  "Duck Meatballs" and "Ostrich Meatballs" are poultry-derived meatballs, they consist
  of different types of poultry meat (duck and ostrich, respectively) and therefore
  have distinct nutritional profiles, cooking methods, and culinary uses.
