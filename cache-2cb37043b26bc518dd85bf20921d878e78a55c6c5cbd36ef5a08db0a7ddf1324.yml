  While both ground beef and cuts of beef are types of beef, they have different nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking, so it is useful to distinguish between them rather
  than treating them as semantic and ontological duplicates. Ground beef may contain
  varying amounts of fat depending on the specific type (e.g., ground chuck, ground
  sirloin), while individual cuts of beef can vary widely in terms of their lean-to-fat
  ratio, tenderness, and cooking method. Therefore, it is important for a dietitian
  to consider these differences when providing recommendations around beef consumption.'
