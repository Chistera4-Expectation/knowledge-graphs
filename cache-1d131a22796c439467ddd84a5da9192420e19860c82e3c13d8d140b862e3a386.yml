text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are considered types of butter,
  they have distinct differences in terms of ingredients and nutritional content.
  Plant-based butter is made from plant-based oils, while salted butter is made from
  milk or cream. Merging them would result in loss of important information about
  the ingredients and nutritional values of each type.
