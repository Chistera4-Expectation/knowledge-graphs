text: ' No. While chicken breast and chicken pieces are both types of poultry meat,
  they have different nutritional profiles and culinary uses, so they should not be
  considered semantic or ontological duplicates. Chicken breast is typically leaner
  with less fat and calories compared to chicken pieces (which can include cuts like
  thighs, drumsticks, and wings), which tend to have higher fat content. Therefore,
  it is important to maintain these distinctions when discussing poultry-derived foods.'
