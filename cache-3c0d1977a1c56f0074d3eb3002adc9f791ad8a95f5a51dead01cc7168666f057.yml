text: No, they should not be merged together. Although both Allspice and Chinese five-spice
  powder are spices, they have distinct compositions and flavors. Allspice is a single
  spice derived from the dried berries of the Pimenta dioica plant, while Chinese
  five-spice powder is a blend of five different spices, typically including star
  anise, cloves, Chinese cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds.
