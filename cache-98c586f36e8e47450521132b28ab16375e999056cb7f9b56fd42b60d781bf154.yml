  Chia seeds and kiwi seeds are not semantic or ontological duplicates and should
  not be merged. While both are types of seeds, they come from different plants (chia
  seeds coming from Salvia hispanica and kiwi seeds from Actinidia deliciosa) with
  distinct nutritional profiles and uses. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them
  as separate entities within an edible seed classification system.'
