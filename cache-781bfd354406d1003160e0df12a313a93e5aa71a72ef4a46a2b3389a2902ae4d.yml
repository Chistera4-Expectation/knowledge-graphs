text: ' Yes. In terms of both their semantics (i.e., meaning) and ontology (i.e.,
  how they fit into broader categories), long-grain white rice and white rice can
  be considered duplicates since they refer to the same basic type of rice that has
  been milled and stripped of its bran and germ layers, resulting in a starchy product
  with a consistent texture and lengthier kernels compared to other types of rice
  such as short-grain or medium-grain rice. Therefore, merging these two instances
  would not result in any loss of meaningful information.'
