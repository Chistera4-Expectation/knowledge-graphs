text: No, "Guinea Fowl Eggs" and "Guinea Fowl Gravy" should not be merged together
  as they are different types of food derived from guinea fowl. Guinea Fowl Eggs are
  a specific food item, while Guinea Fowl Gravy is a sauce made from the meat or drippings
  of guinea fowl. They have different nutritional profiles and uses in cooking, so
  they should be considered separate instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
