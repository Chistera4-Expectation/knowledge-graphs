text: As a dietician, I would say that 'Blueberry juice' and 'Mango juice' are not
  semantic and ontologic duplicates, as they are distinct types of fruit juices with
  different nutritional profiles and properties. Although they can both be classified
  as fruit juices, they are not identical in nature and should not be merged together.
  So, the answer is no.
