text: No, 'Carrot juice' and 'Tomato juice' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are juices, they are distinct types of juices derived from
  different fruits or vegetables and have different nutritional profiles. Merging
  them would not accurately represent the unique qualities of each type of juice.
