text: No, they should not be merged together. While both are sauces, they have distinct
  ingredients and flavor profiles. Barbecue sauce typically contains tomato sauce,
  vinegar, sugar, and various spices, while tomato sauce is made primarily from tomatoes,
  with added seasonings. They serve different culinary purposes and are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.
