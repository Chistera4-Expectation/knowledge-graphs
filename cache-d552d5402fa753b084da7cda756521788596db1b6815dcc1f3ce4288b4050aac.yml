text: No, 'Quail Broth' and 'Quail Stock' should not be merged together as they are
  not exactly the same. While they are both derived from quail, broth typically contains
  additional ingredients such as vegetables, herbs, and sometimes meat, whereas stock
  is made by simmering bones, sometimes with added aromatics, but without additional
  ingredients like vegetables or herbs.
