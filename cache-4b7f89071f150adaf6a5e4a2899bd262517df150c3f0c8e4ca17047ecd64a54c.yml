text: ' "Processed Meats" would be the most appropriate class for all of the options
  provided, as it is a general category that includes processed beef, pork, and poultry
  products. However, if we are to choose one specific option, then "Processed Pork-Derived
  Food" or "Processed Poultry-Derived Food" may be more suitable depending on the
  context, since these categories are more narrowly defined than simply "processed
  meat." On the other hand, "Meat" is too broad a term, while "Beef" refers to a single
  type of meat, which does not cover the range of processed meats available in the
  market.'
