text: No, 'Soft Water' and 'Spring Water' should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of drinking water with different characteristics and origins. Soft
  water typically refers to water with low mineral content, while spring water comes
  from an underground source and can have varying mineral content depending on the
  specific spring.
