text: No, while chicken soup and chicken stock share a common ingredient (chicken),
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Chicken soup typically includes
  additional ingredients such as vegetables, noodles, or rice, and is served as a
  dish. Chicken stock, on the other hand, is a liquid base made from simmering chicken
  bones, vegetables, and seasonings, and is used as a cooking ingredient in various
  dishes. Therefore, they have different uses and compositions, making them distinct
  entities within the Poultry-derived Food class.
