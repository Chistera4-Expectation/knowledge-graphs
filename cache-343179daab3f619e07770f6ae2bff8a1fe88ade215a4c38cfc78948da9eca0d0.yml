text: ' No. Alfalfa honey is a type of monofloral honey produced by bees that gather
  nectar primarily from alfalfa flowers, while honey refers to a sweet substance made
  by honeybees from the nectar of flowers. Therefore, they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates but rather different types of honey with distinct characteristics.'
