text: No, Red wine vinegar and Rice vinegar should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of vinegar, they have different
  flavors, acidity levels, and uses in cooking. Red wine vinegar has a bold, robust
  flavor and is made from red wine, while rice vinegar has a mild, slightly sweet
  flavor and is made from fermented rice.
