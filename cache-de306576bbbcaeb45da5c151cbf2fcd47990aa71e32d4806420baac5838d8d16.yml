text: No, they should not be merged. Purified Water and Sparkling Water are different
  types of drinking water with distinct characteristics. Purified Water is water that
  has been mechanically filtered or processed to remove impurities, while Sparkling
  Water is water that contains dissolved carbon dioxide gas, resulting in effervescence
  or fizz. Although both are types of drinking water, they have different properties
  and are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
