  In terms of both semantics (the meaning of words) and ontology (the nature of being),
  ''Cilantro'' and ''Fresh Cilantro'' can be considered duplicates. This is because
  they refer to the same plant, Coriandrum sativum, which is commonly known as cilantro
  when its leaves are used as an herb in cooking, particularly in Mexican and other
  Latin American cuisines. The term "fresh" is often added to differentiate between
  fresh cilantro leaves and dried coriander seeds, which have a different flavor profile
  and are used in different culinary applications. However, since they refer to the
  same plant species, it would make sense to merge these two instances under a single
  name, such as simply "cilantro," with additional attributes or properties specified
  if necessary to indicate whether the plant material is fresh or dried.'
