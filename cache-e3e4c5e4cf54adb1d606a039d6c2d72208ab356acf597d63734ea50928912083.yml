text: No, 'Prune juice' and 'Watermelon juice' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are juices, they are made from different fruits
  and have distinct nutritional profiles and properties. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the differences between the two juices.
