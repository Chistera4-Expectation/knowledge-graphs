  While both blue cheese dressing and Russian dressing are types of food dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients and flavors that make them unique from one another.
  Blue cheese dressing is typically made with crumbled blue cheese, mayonnaise, sour
  cream, vinegar, and spices, while Russian dressing usually consists of mayonnaise,
  ketchup, relish, horseradish, and various seasonings. Therefore, it would not be
  appropriate to merge these two concepts as semantic and ontological duplicates since
  they represent different culinary traditions and uses.'
