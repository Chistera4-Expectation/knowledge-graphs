text: No, Ostrich Stock and Turkey Stock should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both derived from poultry, they are distinct types
  of stock with different ingredients and nutritional profiles. The two stocks come
  from different animals, which could result in different flavors and nutrient compositions.
  Therefore, they should be treated as separate entities in a classification system.
