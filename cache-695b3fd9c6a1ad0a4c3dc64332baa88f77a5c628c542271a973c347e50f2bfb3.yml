text: No, Amp Energy and C4 Energy should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are energy drinks, they are produced by different companies
  (Amp Energy by PepsiCo and C4 Energy by Cellucor), have different formulations,
  and may have distinct target markets and flavors. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the real-world distinctions between these two products.
