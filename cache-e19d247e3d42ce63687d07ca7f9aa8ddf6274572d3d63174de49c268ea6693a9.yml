text: No, 'Papaya juice' and 'Vegetable Juice' should not be merged together as they
  are different types of juices. 'Papaya juice' is a fruit juice, while 'Vegetable
  Juice' is a separate category that includes juices made from vegetables. Although
  both are juices, they have distinct characteristics and should be treated as separate
  entities in the Juice class.
