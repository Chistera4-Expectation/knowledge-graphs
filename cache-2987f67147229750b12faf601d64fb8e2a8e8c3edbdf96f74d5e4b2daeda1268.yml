text: ' No. Cherry blossom honey and heather honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates, even though they both belong to the general category of "honey." They
  come from different floral sources (cherry blossoms vs. heather) and have distinct
  flavor profiles, nutritional content, and other properties. Therefore, it would
  not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates.'
