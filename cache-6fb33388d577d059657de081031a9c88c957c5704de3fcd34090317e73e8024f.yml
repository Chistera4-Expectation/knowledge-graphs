  As a dietitian, I can explain that avocado honey and buckwheat honey are two different
  types of honey with distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. Avocado honey
  is made from the nectar of avocado blossoms and has a mild, buttery flavor, while
  buckwheat honey is made from the nectar of buckwheat flowers and has a darker color
  and stronger, earthier flavor. They have different mineral contents, vitamins, and
  antioxidants. Therefore, they shouldn''t be considered semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
