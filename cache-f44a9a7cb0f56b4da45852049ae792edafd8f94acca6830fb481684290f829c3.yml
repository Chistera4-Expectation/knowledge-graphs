text: No, the instances 'Australian Yogurt' and 'Icelandic Yogurt' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both represent types of
  yogurt, they have distinct characteristics, ingredients, and cultural backgrounds.
  Merging them would result in the loss of these unique attributes and could lead
  to confusion.
