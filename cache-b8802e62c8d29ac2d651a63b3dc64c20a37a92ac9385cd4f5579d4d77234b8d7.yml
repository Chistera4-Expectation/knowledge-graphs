  Although both "French dressing" and "horseradish dressing" are types of salad dressings,
  they have distinct ingredients and flavors that make them unique from one another.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Keeping them separate allows for more accurate categorization
  and understanding of each type of dressing.'
