text: No, Black Tea and Pu-erh Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they both belong to the category of tea, they have distinct characteristics
  and processing methods. Black tea is oxidized, resulting in its dark color and full-bodied
  flavor, while Pu-erh tea is a fermented tea, which gives it a unique earthy flavor.
  These differences warrant separate instances in the Tea class.
