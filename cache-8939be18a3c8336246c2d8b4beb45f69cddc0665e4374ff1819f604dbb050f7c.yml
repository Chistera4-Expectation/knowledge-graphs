text: ' No. While pork chops and pork shoulder both come from pigs and can be classified
  under the broader category of "pork," they are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  They refer to distinct cuts of meat with different properties, uses, and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them as separate instances within
  the Pork-derived Food class.'
