text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different types of yogurt with
  distinct characteristics. French Yogurt refers to a specific type of yogurt that
  is typically made using traditional French methods, while Low-Fat Yogurt refers
  to a type of yogurt that has reduced fat content. These two types of yogurt can
  be differentiated based on their production methods, nutritional content, and flavor
  profiles, making them distinct entities in a yogurt classification system.
