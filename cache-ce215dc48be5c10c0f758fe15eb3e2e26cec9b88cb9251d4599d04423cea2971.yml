text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different dishes made from
  pheasant. Pheasant Broth is a soup made from pheasant stock, while Pheasant Patties
  are small, flat patties made from ground pheasant meat. Although they both belong
  to the Poultry-derived Food class, they have distinct ingredients and preparation
  methods.
