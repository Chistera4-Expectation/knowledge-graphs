text: ' The most adequate class for olives would be "Edible Fruits." Although they
  are often thought of as vegetables, olives are actually fruits because they develop
  from the ovary of a flower and contain seeds. Additionally, olives provide various
  health benefits due to their high monounsaturated fat content, making them a healthy
  choice within the category of edible fruits.'
