text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. While
  both 'Chicken Broth' and 'Guinea Fowl Broth' are poultry-derived broths, they come
  from different types of poultry and may have distinct nutritional profiles, flavors,
  and culinary uses. Therefore, they should be treated as separate instances within
  the Poultry-derived Food class.
