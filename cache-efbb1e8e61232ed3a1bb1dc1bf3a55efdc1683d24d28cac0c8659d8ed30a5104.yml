  While both Blueberry Honey and Heather Honey are types of honey, they are not semantic
  nor ontological duplicates because they come from different floral sources (blueberries
  vs heather) which gives them unique flavor profiles, color, and consistency. Therefore,
  it is important to distinguish between these two varieties for accurate labeling,
  ingredient sourcing, and consumer understanding.'
