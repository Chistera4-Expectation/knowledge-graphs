  Breadcrumbs and rye bread are two different types of bread, with distinct ingredients,
  textures, and flavors. While they share some similarities, they are not identical
  and can serve different purposes in cooking and baking. Therefore, it is not appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
