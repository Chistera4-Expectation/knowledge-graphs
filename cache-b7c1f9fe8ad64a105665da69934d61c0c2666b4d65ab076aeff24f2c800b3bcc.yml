text: No, they should not be merged. While both are poultry-derived foods, they are
  distinct dishes with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Turkey soup
  is a liquid dish made from turkey broth, while turkey thighs are a cut of meat.
  They are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
