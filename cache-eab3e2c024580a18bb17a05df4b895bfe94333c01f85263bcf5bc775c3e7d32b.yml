text: ' No. Long grain white rice is a type of rice but it is not a duplicate of "rice"
  in general. There are many different types of rice (e.g., short-grain brown rice,
  basmati rice, jasmine rice) that have unique nutritional profiles and uses in cooking.
  Therefore, long grain white rice and rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
