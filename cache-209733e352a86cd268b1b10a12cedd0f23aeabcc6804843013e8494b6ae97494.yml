text: No, they should not be merged together. Infused water and purified water have
  distinct differences in their preparation and composition. Infused water is water
  that has had fruits, vegetables, or herbs added to it for flavor, while purified
  water has undergone a process to remove impurities and contaminants. Although both
  are types of drinking water, they serve different purposes and cater to different
  preferences.
