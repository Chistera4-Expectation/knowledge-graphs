text: ' ''Edible Fish'' would be the most adequate class for anchovies. Anchovies
  are a type of small, oily fish that belong to the family Engraulidae. They are widely
  consumed around the world and are often used as a flavoring in various dishes due
  to their strong taste. As such, they are typically classified as a type of edible
  fish rather than crustacean or mollusc.'
