text: No, Avocado Oil and Macadamia Nut Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they both fall under the category of edible vegetable
  oils, they have distinct nutritional profiles, uses, and extraction processes. Merging
  them would result in a loss of specific information about each type of oil.
