text: As a dietician, I would suggest that the instances '(Optional) Fresh lemon juice'
  and 'Lemon juice' should not be merged together, as they have slightly different
  meanings. '(Optional) Fresh lemon juice' implies that the addition of lemon juice
  is not mandatory, while 'Lemon juice' does not convey that optional aspect. Although
  they both refer to the same ingredient, they have different semantic meanings in
  terms of their use in a recipe.
