text: No, they should not be merged. While both canola oil and cooking oil are edible
  vegetable oils, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Canola oil is a specific
  type of cooking oil derived from the rapeseed plant, whereas cooking oil is a broader
  term that encompasses various types of edible oils used for cooking. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate entities in the classification.
