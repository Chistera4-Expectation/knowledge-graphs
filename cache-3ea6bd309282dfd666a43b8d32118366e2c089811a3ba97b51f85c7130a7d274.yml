text: 'As a dietician, my answer would be: No, "Cream" and "Heavy Cream" should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates. While they both belong
  to the Dairy Product class, they have distinct properties and uses in recipes, which
  makes them unique entities. "Heavy cream" typically has a higher fat content than
  regular "cream." Therefore, keeping them separate in a classification system is
  essential for accurate dietary recommendations and recipe guidance.'
