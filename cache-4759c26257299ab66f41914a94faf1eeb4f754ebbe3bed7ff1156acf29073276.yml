  While both pork fat and pork roast are derived from pigs, they have different nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.


  Pork fat is high in calories and saturated fats but low in protein, while pork roast
  contains more protein, vitamins, and minerals than pork fat. Additionally, pork
  fat is typically used for flavoring or cooking other foods, whereas pork roast can
  be consumed on its own as a main dish. Merging these two instances would result
  in a loss of important distinctions between them.'
