text: As a dietician, I can provide information about the nutritional aspects of honey
  but not make decisions about merging instances in a specific database or system.
  However, Acacia Honey and Sage Honey are both types of honey and share similar nutritional
  profiles. They might be considered as semantic and ontologic duplicates in certain
  contexts, but it would depend on the specific requirements and purposes of the database
  or system in question.
