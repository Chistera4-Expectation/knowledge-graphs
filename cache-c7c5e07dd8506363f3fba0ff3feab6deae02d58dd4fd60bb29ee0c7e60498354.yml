text: No, Grape juice and Prune juice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of fruit juices, they come from
  different fruits (grapes and prunes, respectively) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles and characteristics. Merging them would not accurately represent the variety
  of fruit juices available.
