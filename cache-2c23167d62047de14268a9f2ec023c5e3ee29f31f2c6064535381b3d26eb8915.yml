text: Yes, it would be appropriate to merge 'Parmesan cheese' and 'Parmesan' as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates since they refer to the same type of cheese. However, it's
  essential to consider the context and the purpose of the classification system.
  In a general cheese classification, merging them would make sense, while in a more
  detailed system, they could be considered as synonyms or variations of the same
  cheese type.
