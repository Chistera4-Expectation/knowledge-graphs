text: No, Coriander leaves and Scent leaves should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both leafy herbs, they have distinct
  flavors and uses in cooking. Coriander leaves, also known as cilantro, have a citrus-like
  flavor, while Scent leaves, also known as Nchuanwu or Efirin, have a more minty
  and peppery taste. They are used in different types of cuisine and are not interchangeable
  in recipes.
