  While Kashmiri chili powder and red chili powder may both be types of chili powders,
  they have different flavor profiles, heat levels, and uses in cooking. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates
  from a culinary perspective.


  Kashmiri chili powder is known for its mild heat level and vibrant red color, which
  makes it an excellent choice for adding color and depth to dishes without overpowering
  their flavors. It has a slightly sweet and fruity taste with minimal bitterness.


  On the other hand, Red chili powder (also called Cayenne pepper) tends to have a
  higher heat index than Kashmiri chili powder. Its flavor profile is typically characterized
  by pungency and sharpness due to the presence of capsaicin.


  Given these differences, keeping separate listings for Kashmiri chili powder and
  Red chili powder helps maintain clarity around each ingredient''s unique properties
  and applications in recipes.'
