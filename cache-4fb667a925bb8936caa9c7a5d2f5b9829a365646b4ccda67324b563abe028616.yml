text: No, Cocoa powder and Lucuma powder should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both powders used as sweeteners, they
  have different origins, nutritional profiles, and flavor characteristics. Cocoa
  powder comes from cocoa beans, while Lucuma powder is derived from the fruit of
  the Pouteria lucuma tree. Keeping them as separate instances allows for accurate
  representation of their unique properties in a knowledge base or ontology.
