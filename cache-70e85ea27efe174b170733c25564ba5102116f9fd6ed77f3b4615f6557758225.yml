  While both ''Optional dipping sauce'' and ''Sauce'' may seem related, they are not
  necessarily semantic or ontological duplicates. An optional dipping sauce implies
  that it is an additional condiment served on the side for diners to use at their
  discretion, while ''Sauce'' could refer to any type of liquid accompaniment served
  with food. Therefore, these concepts have distinct meanings and uses in different
  contexts.'
