text: No, Bulgarian Yogurt and Kefir Yogurt should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although both are types of yogurt, they have distinct fermentation processes,
  ingredients, and nutritional profiles. Bulgarian Yogurt is made using Lactobacillus
  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, while Kefir Yogurt
  is made using kefir grains that contain various bacteria and yeasts. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate instances in a yogurt classification system.
