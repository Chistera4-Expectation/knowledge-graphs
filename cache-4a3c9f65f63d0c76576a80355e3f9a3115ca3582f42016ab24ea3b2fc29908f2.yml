text: ' No. Teriyaki Dressing and Thousand Island Dressing are two distinct types
  of salad dressings with different ingredients and flavors. While they may both be
  used to top salads or other dishes, their compositions and nutritional properties
  differ significantly. Therefore, they should not be merged as semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.'
