text: No, Pineapple juice and Watermelon juice should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the category of juice, they are
  distinct types of juice with unique flavors and nutritional profiles. Merging them
  would result in a loss of specific information about each type of juice.
