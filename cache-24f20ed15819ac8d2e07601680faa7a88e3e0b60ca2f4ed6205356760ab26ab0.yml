  The terms "Lime wedges" and "Lime zest" refer to different parts of the lime fruit,
  with distinct textures, flavors, and culinary uses. Lime wedges are the juicy, pulpy
  sections of the fruit that are typically squeezed for their juice, while lime zest
  is the outer, colorful skin of the fruit that is often grated or minced for its
  citrusy flavor. These differences make them unique instances in the Edible Fruit
  class, rather than semantic and ontological duplicates.'
