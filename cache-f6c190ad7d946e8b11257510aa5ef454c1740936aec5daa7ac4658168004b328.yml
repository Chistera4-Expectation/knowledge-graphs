text: No, Curry Powder and Five-spice powder should not be merged as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although they are both seasoning blends, they have distinct
  compositions, flavors, and uses in different cuisines. Curry Powder is a blend of
  spices commonly used in Indian and South Asian cuisine, while Five-spice powder
  is a blend of spices used in Chinese cuisine. They should be treated as separate
  entities in the context of a Food Seasoning class.
