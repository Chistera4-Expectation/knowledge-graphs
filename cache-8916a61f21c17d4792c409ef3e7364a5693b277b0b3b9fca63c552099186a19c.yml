text: No, they should not be merged together. While both "Pheasant Patties" and "Turkey
  Patties" belong to the Poultry-derived Food class, they are different types of poultry
  and would have distinct nutritional and culinary properties. Therefore, they should
  be treated as separate instances within the ontology.
