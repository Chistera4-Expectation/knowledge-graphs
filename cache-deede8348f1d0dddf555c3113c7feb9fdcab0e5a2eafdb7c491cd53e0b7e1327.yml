text: No, 'Distilled Water' and 'Infused Water' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of water, they have different
  properties and uses. Distilled water is purified by removing all minerals and impurities,
  while infused water is created by adding natural flavors or nutrients to water through
  the process of infusing fruits, vegetables, or herbs. These differences make them
  distinct from each other.
