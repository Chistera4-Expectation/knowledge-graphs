  While both red bell peppers and red onions are indeed edible vegetables, they belong
  to different botanical families and have distinct nutritional profiles, uses, flavors,
  and appearances. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  or ontological duplicates from a dietary perspective.


  1. Botanically: Red bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) belong to the Solanaceae family,
  while red onions (Allium cepa) are part of the Amaryllidaceae family. They are classified
  differently at higher taxonomic levels due to their unique genetic makeup.

  2. Nutrition: Both provide various health benefits but differ significantly in terms
  of micronutrients, vitamins, and minerals. For instance, red bell peppers contain
  high amounts of Vitamin C, A, B6, E, and K1, whereas red onions offer rich sources
  of Vitamin C, manganese, chromium, biotin, and dietary fiber.

  3. Flavor & Appearance: These two vegetables also vary greatly when considering
  taste and appearance. Red bell peppers boast a sweet flavor with mild heat, depending
  upon ripeness, and present themselves as bright red, crunchy fruits. On the other
  hand, red onions possess a pungent yet slightly sweet taste, featuring multiple
  layers within their bulbous shape that range from white to reddish-purple hues.

  4. Uses: Due to their contrasting characteristics, these veggies serve diverse culinary
  purposes. Red bell peppers can be consumed raw or cooked, adding color, texture,
  and subtle spice notes to dishes like salads, stir-fries, pastas, or sauces. In
  comparison, red onions typically contribute more robust flavors to recipes such
  as soups, stews, chutneys, relishes, sandwiches, and grilled kebabs.


  In conclusion, merging red bell peppers and red onions as semantic and ontological
  duplicates is incorrect because they represent separate entities within the context
  of nutrition, botany, culinary applications, and overall gastronomy.'
