text: ' No. While both white wine and rice wine are types of alcoholic drinks, they
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they have different ingredients
  and origins. White wine is typically made from grapes, while rice wine is made from
  fermented rice. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances
  together.'
