text: ' No. Arborio rice and rice paper wrappers are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates and should not be merged. They serve different purposes in cooking and
  have distinct nutritional profiles. Arborio rice is used primarily for making risotto
  and other Italian dishes that require creamy textures, while rice paper wrappers
  are often used to make Vietnamese-style fresh spring rolls or dried rolls known
  as summer rolls. Merging them would result in incorrect information about their
  uses and properties.'
