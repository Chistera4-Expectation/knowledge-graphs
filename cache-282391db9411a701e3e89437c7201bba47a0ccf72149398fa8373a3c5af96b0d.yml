text: No, Chestnut Honey and Wildflower Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of honey, they come from different
  sources and have distinct flavors and properties. Chestnut Honey comes from the
  nectar of chestnut tree flowers, while Wildflower Honey comes from the nectar of
  various wildflowers. Merging them would result in loss of information about their
  specific characteristics.
