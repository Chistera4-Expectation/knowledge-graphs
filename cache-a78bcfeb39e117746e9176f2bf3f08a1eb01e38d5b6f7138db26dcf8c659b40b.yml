  While both "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Rotisserie Chicken" are poultry-derived foods,
  they have different ingredients, preparation methods, and uses. Therefore, it is
  not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates. A Chicken
  Caesar Salad typically includes romaine lettuce, croutons, parmesan cheese, dressing,
  and cooked chicken (often from a rotisserie chicken), while Rotisserie Chicken refers
  solely to a seasoned and roasted whole chicken that can be served on its own or
  used as an ingredient for other dishes.'
