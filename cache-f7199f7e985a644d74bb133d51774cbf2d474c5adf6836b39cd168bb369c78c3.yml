text: ' The most adequate class name for "Artificial Sweeteners" would be simply "Sweeteners".
  While some people might argue that artificial sweeteners could also fall under the
  category of " Food Additives" or "Flavorings", the primary function of artificial
  sweeteners is to provide a sweet taste, making them more closely related to natural
  and artificial sweeteners than other categories like food dressings, sauces, spices,
  or seasonings.'
