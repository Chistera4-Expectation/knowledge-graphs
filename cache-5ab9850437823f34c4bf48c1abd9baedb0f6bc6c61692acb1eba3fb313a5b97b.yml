text: ' None of the given options directly relate to gelatin. Gelatin is derived from
  collagen, usually obtained from animal by-products such as bones and skin, rather
  than being classified under any specific food category like beef or poultry. However,
  it can be considered indirectly related to "edible crustaceans," "edible fish,"
  "edible mollusks" since they are sources of collagen that can potentially be used
  in making gelatin. But this connection isn''t strong enough to consider these categories
  most suitable for gelatin. The best answer would still be none of the provided categories.'
