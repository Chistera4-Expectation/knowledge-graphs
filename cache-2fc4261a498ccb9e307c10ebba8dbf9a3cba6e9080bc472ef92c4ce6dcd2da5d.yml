text: No, "Duck Breast" and "Duck Broth" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While both are derived from ducks, they are different
  food products with distinct nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Duck Breast
  is a cut of meat, while Duck Broth is a liquid derived from cooking duck parts or
  bones.
