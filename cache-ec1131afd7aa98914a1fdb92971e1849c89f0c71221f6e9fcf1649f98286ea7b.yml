text: No, they should not be merged. While they both fall under the category of rice,
  they are distinct types of rice with different properties and uses. Basmati Rice
  is a specific type of long-grain rice, while Rice Rolls refer to a dish made from
  rice. They are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
