  While Ranch Dressing and Russian Dressing may have some similarities, they are not
  semantic nor ontological duplicates. They have distinct ingredients, flavors, textures,
  and cultural origins that make them unique from each other. Therefore, it is important
  to keep these two dressings separate and maintain their individual identities.'
