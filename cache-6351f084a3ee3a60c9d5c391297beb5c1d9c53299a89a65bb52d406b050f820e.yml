text: As a dietician, I would suggest that 'Flavored Butter' and 'Light Butter' should
  not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. They are different types of
  butter with distinct properties and nutritional values. Flavored butter contains
  additional ingredients for flavoring, while light butter has a reduced fat content
  compared to regular butter. Therefore, they should be treated as separate entities
  in a classification system.
