text: ' No. Chicken Caesar salad and Chicken curry are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, even though they both contain chicken. They have different ingredients,
  preparation methods, cultural origins, and culinary uses. Therefore, it is appropriate
  to keep them separate when categorizing poultry-derived foods.'
