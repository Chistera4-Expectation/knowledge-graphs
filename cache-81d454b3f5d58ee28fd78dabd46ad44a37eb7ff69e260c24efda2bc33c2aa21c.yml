text: ' No. Honey Lime Dressing and Teriyaki Dressing are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. While both dressings may contain sweeteners like honey and have a savory-sweet
  flavor profile, they differ in their primary ingredients and cultural origins. Honey
  Lime Dressing typically consists of honey, lime juice, oil, vinegar, and spices,
  while Teriyaki Dressing is made from soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, garlic, and ginger.
  Therefore, they represent distinct culinary items with unique characteristics.'
