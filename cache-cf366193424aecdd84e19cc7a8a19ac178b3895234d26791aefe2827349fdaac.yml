text: No, Chamomile Tea and Jasmine Tea should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates because they are different types of tea with distinct flavors,
  properties, and health benefits. While they may both be considered under the broader
  category of tea, they are not duplicates of each other.
