text: No, Grapeseed Oil and Peanut Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are edible vegetable oils, they come from different
  sources (grape seeds and peanuts, respectively) and have different nutritional profiles,
  flavor profiles, and uses in cooking.
