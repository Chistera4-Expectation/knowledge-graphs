text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Pheasant Gizzards' and 'Pheasant Patties' are derived from poultry, specifically
  pheasants, they are distinct food items with different preparation methods, textures,
  and culinary uses. 'Pheasant Gizzards' refer to the edible muscular stomach of the
  pheasant, whereas 'Pheasant Patties' are ground pheasant meat shaped into patties,
  typically for cooking as burgers or fritters.
