text: No, "Turkey Tenders" and "Turkey" should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although both are poultry-derived foods, "Turkey Tenders" refer to a
  specific cut of meat (strips or small pieces of turkey) while "Turkey" refers to
  the entire bird or its generic meat. These are distinct items with different properties
  and uses in recipes or meal planning.
