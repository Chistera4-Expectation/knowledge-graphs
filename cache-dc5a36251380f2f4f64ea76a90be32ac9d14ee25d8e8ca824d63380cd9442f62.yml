text: No, "Ostrich Meat" and "Quail Meat" should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of poultry-derived food. While they both belong to the Poultry-derived
  Food class, they have different nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and cultural
  significance. They should be treated as separate instances within the class.
