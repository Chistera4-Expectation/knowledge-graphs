text: No, they should not be merged as they are different cuts of pork with distinct
  characteristics and cooking methods. Pork loin refers to a leaner, boneless cut
  from the back of the animal, while pork roast can refer to a variety of cuts, including
  loin, shoulder, or leg, with or without bones. Although they are both derived from
  pork, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates.
