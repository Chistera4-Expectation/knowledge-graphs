text: No, these instances should not be merged. Although they both fall under the
  category of yogurt, they have different characteristics and target different dietary
  preferences. Australian Yogurt may refer to a specific brand or type of yogurt from
  Australia, while Vegan Yogurt refers to yogurt that is made without any animal products.
  Merging these instances would not accurately represent the distinct qualities of
  each type of yogurt.
