text: No, Lime juice and Pineapple juice should not be merged together as they are
  distinct types of juices made from different fruits. While they may both be categorized
  as fruit juices, they have unique properties, flavors, and nutritional profiles.
  Merging them together would not accurately represent the specific characteristics
  of each juice.
