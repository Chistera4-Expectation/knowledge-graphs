text: No, Rice Rolls and Sticky Rice should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are related to rice, they are different types of
  dishes or preparations. Rice Rolls typically refer to a type of Asian dish, such
  as sushi or Vietnamese rice paper rolls, where rice is used as a component, while
  Sticky Rice refers to a specific type of rice preparation, where the rice is cooked
  to a sticky consistency and can be served with various dishes.
