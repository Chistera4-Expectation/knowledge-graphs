  The term "canola oil" refers specifically to an edible vegetable oil that is extracted
  from the seeds of the canola plant (Brassica napus), while "vegetable oil for frying"
  is a more general term that could refer to any type of vegetable oil used for frying
  purposes. While there may be some overlap in their uses and properties, they are
  not necessarily interchangeable terms, and it would not be accurate to merge them
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
