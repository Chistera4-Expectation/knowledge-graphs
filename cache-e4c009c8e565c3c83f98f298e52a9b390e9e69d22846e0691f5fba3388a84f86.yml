text: ' No. While both "turkey" and "turkey slices" are types of poultry-derived food,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. Turkey is a type of bird, while
  turkey slices refer to a specific form or preparation of that bird. Merging them
  would result in a loss of information about the different levels of categorization
  within this domain.'
