  The two instances, "Pumpkin seeds" and "Chia seeds for added crunch," are not exact
  duplicates. While they share some similarities in terms of being edible seeds, they
  come from different sources (pumpkins vs. chia plants) and have distinct nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep them separate rather than merging
  them as duplicates.'
