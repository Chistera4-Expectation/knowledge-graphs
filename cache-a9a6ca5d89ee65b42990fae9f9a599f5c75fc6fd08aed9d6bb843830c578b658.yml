text: No, boiling water and purified water are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
  While both methods may be used to remove impurities, they are different processes
  and can serve different purposes. Boiling water is a method of disinfection by killing
  bacteria, while purified water involves the removal of impurities and contaminants
  through filtration or other processes. Therefore, they should not be merged together
  as duplicates.
