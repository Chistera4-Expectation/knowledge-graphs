text: No, 'Grapefruit juice' and 'Peach juice' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates because they are different types of juices made from distinct
  fruits with unique nutritional profiles and characteristics. Although they both
  fall under the general category of "juice," they are not identical in terms of their
  composition, flavor, or nutritional content.
