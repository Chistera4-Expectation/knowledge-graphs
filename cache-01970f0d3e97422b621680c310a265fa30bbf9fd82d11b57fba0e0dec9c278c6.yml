text: No, the instances 'Organic Butter' and 'Spreadable Butter' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the broader
  category of "butter," they have distinct characteristics and properties that set
  them apart. Organic Butter refers to butter made from organic milk, while Spreadable
  Butter typically has added ingredients (such as vegetable oil) to make it easier
  to spread.
