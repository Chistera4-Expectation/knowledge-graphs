  While both ''beef'' and ''ground beef'' are types of meat that come from cattle,
  they have distinct differences in their form and preparation. ''Beef'' typically
  refers to the muscle meat of the cow, which can be cut into various primal and retail
  cuts such as steaks, roasts, and ribs. On the other hand, ''ground beef'' is made
  by grinding or chopping lean beef trimmings with a certain amount of fat content.
  Due to these distinctions, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
