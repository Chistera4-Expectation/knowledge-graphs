  While both flaxseed oil and vegetable oil are types of edible oils, they cannot
  be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they come from different
  plant sources and have distinct nutritional profiles. Flaxseed oil is extracted
  specifically from the seeds of the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum) and has high
  levels of omega-3 fatty acids, making it an excellent choice for promoting heart
  health. On the other hand, vegetable oil is a general term used to describe various
  plant-derived oils such as soybean, corn, cottonseed, canola, sunflower, safflower,
  and palm oils. These oils typically contain higher amounts of monounsaturated and
  polyunsaturated fats but less omega-3 compared to flaxseed oil. Merging them would
  not accurately reflect their unique characteristics.'
