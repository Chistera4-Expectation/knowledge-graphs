text: No, the instances 'Pork Shank' and 'Pork' should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are derived from pork, they are different cuts
  of meat with distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses.
  'Pork' is a general term for meat from a pig, while 'Pork Shank' refers to a specific
  cut from the lower leg of the pig.
