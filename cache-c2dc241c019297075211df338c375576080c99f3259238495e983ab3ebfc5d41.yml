text: ' No. While both "Vitamin A content per serving" and "serving size of the cheese"
  are related to nutrition and cheese consumption, they serve different purposes and
  are not semantic or ontological duplicates. The former provides information about
  the nutritional value of the cheese per serving, while the latter specifies how
  much cheese constitutes one serving. Merging them would result in conflating two
  distinct pieces of information that users might need separately when considering
  their dietary choices.'
