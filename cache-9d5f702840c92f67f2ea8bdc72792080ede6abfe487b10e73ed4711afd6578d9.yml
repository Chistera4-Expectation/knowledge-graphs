text: No, Sourwood Honey and Wildflower Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are types of honey, they differ in terms of
  their floral sources and taste profiles. Sourwood Honey is derived from the nectar
  of sourwood trees, while Wildflower Honey is made from the nectar of various wildflowers.
  These differences in origin affect their flavor, color, and nutritional content.
  Therefore, they should be treated as distinct instances in the Honey class.
