text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they are both types of cabbage,
  they have distinct characteristics and culinary uses. Cabbage (Brassica oleracea
  var. capitata) is a leafy green or purple biennial plant with a dense-leaved head
  and is commonly used in various dishes, while Napa cabbage (Brassica rapa subsp.
  pekinensis) has elongated, light green leaves and is often used in Asian cuisine,
  particularly in dishes like kimchi. Although they share a common name, they are
  different enough to warrant separate instances in the Edible Vegetable class.
