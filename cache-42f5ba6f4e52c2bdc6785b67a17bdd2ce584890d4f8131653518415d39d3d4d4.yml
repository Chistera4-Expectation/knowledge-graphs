text: ' The most adequate class for "Cornmeal" would be "Grain". However, since that
  is not an option in the list you provided, I would suggest "Breakfast Cereal" as
  it is the closest match. While cornmeal can be used in various dishes and not just
  breakfast cereals, it is still classified under grains which are commonly found
  in breakfast cereals.'
