text: No, Tomato paste and Tomato should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they are both derived from tomatoes, they have different properties
  and uses in cooking and nutrition. Tomato paste is a concentrated form of tomatoes
  with a thick, smooth texture, while a tomato is a whole fruit with varying levels
  of ripeness and different ways of preparation.
