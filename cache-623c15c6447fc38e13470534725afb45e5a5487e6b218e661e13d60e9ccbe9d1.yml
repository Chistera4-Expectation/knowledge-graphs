text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  "Duck Sausage" and "Duck Stock" are derived from ducks, they are different food
  items with distinct nutritional profiles, culinary uses, and preparation methods.
  Merging them would not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each food
  item.
