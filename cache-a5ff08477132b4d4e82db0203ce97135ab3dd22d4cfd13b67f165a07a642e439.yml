text: No, Chai Tea and Jasmine Tea should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. They are different types of tea with distinct flavors and characteristics.
  Chai Tea is typically a blend of black tea, spices, and milk, while Jasmine Tea
  is a green tea scented with jasmine flowers. Merging them would result in loss of
  information and potentially cause confusion.
