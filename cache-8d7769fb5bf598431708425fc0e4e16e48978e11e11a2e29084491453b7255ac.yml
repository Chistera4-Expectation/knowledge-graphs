text: ' No. While "Chicken Caesar Salad" and "Chicken Salad" share some similarities
  (both contain chicken), they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because
  they have distinct ingredients and preparations. A Chicken Caesar Salad typically
  includes specific components such as romaine lettuce, croutons, parmesan cheese,
  and a Caesar dressing made with raw egg yolk and anchovies, whereas a generic Chicken
  Salad may consist of various greens, chopped vegetables, and a variety of dressings
  that do not adhere to the traditional Caesar recipe. Therefore, it is important
  to maintain these distinctions for clarity and accuracy when discussing poultry-derived
  foods.'
