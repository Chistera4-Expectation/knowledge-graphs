text: No, they should not be merged together. While both Guinea Fowl and Turkey are
  poultry-derived foods, they are different types of birds with unique nutritional
  profiles. As a result, the broths made from each bird would also have distinct nutritional
  compositions and potentially different uses in cooking or dietary recommendations.
