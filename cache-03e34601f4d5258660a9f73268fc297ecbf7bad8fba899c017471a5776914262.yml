text: As a dietician, I would not consider 'Blueberry juice' and 'Strawberry juice'
  as semantic or ontological duplicates. Although they are both juices, they are made
  from different fruits and have different nutritional profiles. They should be treated
  as separate instances. So, the answer is no.
