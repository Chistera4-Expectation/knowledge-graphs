  In the context of a culinary setting, "goat meat" and "meat" are not necessarily
  interchangeable terms. While both refer to animal tissue consumed as food, they
  have different characteristics, flavors, textures, and cultural associations. Goat
  meat is a specific type of red meat that comes from goats, whereas "meat" can refer
  to any type of animal flesh, including beef, pork, chicken, fish, etc. Therefore,
  it''s important to keep them separate for clarity and accuracy in communication.'
