text: No, 'Quail Gravy' and 'Quail Tenders' should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. They are different types of food derived from quail, with distinct ingredients,
  preparation methods, and nutritional profiles. Quail gravy is a sauce made from
  quail, while quail tenders are a cut of meat from the quail.
