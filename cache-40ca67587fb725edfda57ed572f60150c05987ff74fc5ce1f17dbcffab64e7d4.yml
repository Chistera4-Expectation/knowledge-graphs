text: 'As a dietician, I can provide input on the nutritional aspects of the teas,
  but the classification of tea varieties is more related to botany and cultural aspects.


  That being said, Chai and Darjeeling are two distinct types of tea. Chai typically
  refers to a blend of black tea and various spices, while Darjeeling is a specific
  type of black tea grown in the Darjeeling region of India. Therefore, they should
  not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
