text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they
  both refer to types of pepper, 'Freshly ground black pepper' refers specifically
  to black pepper that has been ground just before use, while 'Pepper' is a more general
  term that could refer to black, white, or other types of pepper. They have different
  properties and uses in cooking.
