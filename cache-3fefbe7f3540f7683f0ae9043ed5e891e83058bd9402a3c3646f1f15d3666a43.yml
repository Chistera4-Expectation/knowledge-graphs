text: As a dietician, my answer is no. Although almond milk and nut milk are related,
  they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. Almond milk specifically refers to
  a milk alternative made from almonds, while nut milk is a more general term that
  could include other types of nut-based milk alternatives, such as cashew milk or
  hazelnut milk.
