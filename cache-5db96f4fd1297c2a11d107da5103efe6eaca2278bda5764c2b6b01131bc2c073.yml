  While both 'Duck Gravy' and 'Ostrich Gravy' are derived from poultry, they are distinctly
  different in terms of ingredients, flavor, and nutritional content. Each type of
  gravy would require a separate entry in the Poultry-derived Food class to accurately
  represent their unique characteristics.
