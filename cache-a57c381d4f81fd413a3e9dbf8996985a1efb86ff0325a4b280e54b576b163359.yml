text: No, they should not be merged together as they represent different types of
  yogurt with distinct characteristics and ingredients. "French Yogurt" typically
  refers to a style of yogurt made using French techniques and ingredients, while
  "Vegan Yogurt" refers to a type of yogurt made without animal products. Both are
  distinct yogurt varieties and should be kept separate.
