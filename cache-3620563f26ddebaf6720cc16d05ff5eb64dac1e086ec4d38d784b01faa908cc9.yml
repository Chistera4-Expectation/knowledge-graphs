text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  'Pork' and 'Roast pork' are derived from the same animal, they represent different
  stages of processing and preparation. 'Pork' generally refers to the raw meat from
  a pig, whereas 'Roast pork' refers to a specific method of cooking pork, which results
  in a different taste, texture, and nutritional profile.
