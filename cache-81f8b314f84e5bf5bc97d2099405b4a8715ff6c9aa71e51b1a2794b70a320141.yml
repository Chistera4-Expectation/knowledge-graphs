text: 'No, Hydrogen Water and Soft Water should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of water, they are not the same.


  Hydrogen Water is regular water with added hydrogen molecules. It is believed to
  have antioxidant properties and potential health benefits.


  Soft Water, on the other hand, is water that has had its mineral ions, such as calcium
  and magnesium, removed. It is called "soft" because it does not form limescale or
  soap scum as easily as hard water. Soft Water is often produced through a process
  called ion exchange or by using a water softener.


  Although both are types of water, they have different properties and uses, so they
  should not be merged as duplicates.'
