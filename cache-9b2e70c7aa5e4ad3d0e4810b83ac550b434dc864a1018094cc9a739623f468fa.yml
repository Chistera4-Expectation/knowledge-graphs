text: No, Dungeness Crab and King Crab should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While both are edible crustaceans, they belong to different
  species and have distinct characteristics, such as size, flavor, and appearance.
  Merging them would result in loss of important information and could lead to confusion
  in dietary recommendations or culinary applications.
