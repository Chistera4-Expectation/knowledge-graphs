text: "As a dietician, I can provide some insights into this question, but it ultimately\
  \ depends on the specific context and purpose of the Tea class. \n\nBlack tea and\
  \ lemon tea are not semantic or ontological duplicates since they are two distinct\
  \ types of tea. Black tea is a variety of tea that is more oxidized than other types,\
  \ resulting in its dark color and rich flavor. Lemon tea, on the other hand, is\
  \ usually a combination of black tea and lemon, sometimes with added sugar or other\
  \ ingredients.\n\nIn a Tea class, it would make sense to keep 'Black Tea' and 'Lemon\
  \ Tea' as separate instances, as they have different properties and uses. However,\
  \ if the class is focused specifically on different flavor combinations or ingredients,\
  \ it might be appropriate to create a new instance for 'Lemon Tea' under the 'Black\
  \ Tea' category. The decision would depend on the overall purpose and structure\
  \ of the class."
