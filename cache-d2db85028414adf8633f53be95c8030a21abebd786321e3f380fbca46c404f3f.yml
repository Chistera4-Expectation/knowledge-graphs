text: No, "Pork Loin" and "Pork Ribs" should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. While both are derived from pork, they are distinct cuts
  of meat with different culinary uses and nutritional profiles. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the unique characteristics of each food item.
