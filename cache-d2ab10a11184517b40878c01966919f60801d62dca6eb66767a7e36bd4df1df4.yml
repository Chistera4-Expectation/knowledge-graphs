text: ' No. Dry Marsala wine and Red wine are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  even though they both belong to the category of alcoholic drinks. They have distinct
  characteristics such as taste (dry vs. red), origin (Marsala, Italy vs. various
  regions worldwide), production process, and usage. Therefore, it is essential to
  keep them separate for accurate representation.'
