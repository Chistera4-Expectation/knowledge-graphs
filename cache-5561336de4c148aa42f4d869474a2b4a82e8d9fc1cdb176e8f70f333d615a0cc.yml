text: No, the instances 'Butter Blend' and 'Cultured Butter' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While they are both types of butter,
  they have different compositions and production processes. Butter Blend is a mixture
  of butter and other fats, while Cultured Butter is made from fermented cream. These
  differences make them distinct types of butter and not duplicates.
