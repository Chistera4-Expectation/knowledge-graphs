text: No, Cashew Milk and Goat's Milk should not be merged together as they are different
  types of milk with distinct nutritional profiles and properties. Cashew Milk is
  a plant-based milk alternative made from cashews, while Goat's Milk is an animal-based
  milk derived from goats. They should be treated as separate instances in a Milk
  class.
