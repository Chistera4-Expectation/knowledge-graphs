text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food. Chicken Gizzards are a specific part of the chicken, while Chicken Meatballs
  are a processed food made from ground chicken meat, often combined with other ingredients
  like bread crumbs and seasonings. These two items have different nutritional profiles
  and culinary applications.
