text: No, Hibiscus Tea and Jasmine Tea should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of tea, they have distinct characteristics,
  flavors, and health benefits. Merging them would not accurately represent the unique
  qualities of each type of tea.
