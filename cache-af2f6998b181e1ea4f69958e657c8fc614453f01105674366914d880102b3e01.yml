  While both "Juice" and "Peach juice" are related, they represent different concepts.
  "Juice" is a general term for a drink made by extracting the liquid from fruits
  or vegetables, while "Peach juice" is a specific type of juice made from peaches.
  They can coexist as separate instances in a class hierarchy.
