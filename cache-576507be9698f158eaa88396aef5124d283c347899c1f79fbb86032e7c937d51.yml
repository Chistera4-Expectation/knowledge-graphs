text: No, 'Carrot juice' and 'Papaya juice' should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Although they are both types of juice, they are made
  from different fruits and have different nutritional profiles. Merging them would
  not accurately represent the distinct characteristics of each juice.
