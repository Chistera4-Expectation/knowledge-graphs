text: As a dietician, I would say that 'Frozen peas' and 'Green peas' are not exactly
  semantic and ontologic duplicates, but they are closely related. While both refer
  to the same vegetable, they represent different states or forms of the vegetable.
  'Green peas' are the fresh or raw version, while 'Frozen peas' are the same vegetable
  that has been processed and preserved through freezing. Therefore, they should not
  be merged as exact duplicates, but they can be considered closely related instances
  within the Edible Vegetable class.
