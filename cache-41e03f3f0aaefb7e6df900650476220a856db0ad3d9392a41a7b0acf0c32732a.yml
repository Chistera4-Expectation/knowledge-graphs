text: ' Yes. In most contexts, "bell pepper" and "bell peppers" can be considered
  semantic and ontological duplicates, referring to the same type of vegetable. It
  would be appropriate to merge them together. However, it is important to note that
  usage may vary depending on the specific context or regional dialect, so always
  consider your audience when deciding whether to treat these terms as interchangeable.'
