  While both "saturated fat per serving" and "sugar per serving" provide information
  about the nutritional content of cheese, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates
  because they measure different types of macronutrients that have distinct effects
  on health. Saturated fats play a role in heart disease risk, while sugars contribute
  to overall calorie intake and can impact dental health, among other things. Therefore,
  it is important for these values to be tracked separately for accurate nutrition
  analysis.'
