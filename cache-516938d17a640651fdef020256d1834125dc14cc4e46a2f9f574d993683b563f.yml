text: No, Guinea Fowl Broth and Guinea Fowl Soup should not be merged together as
  semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they share a common ingredient (Guinea
  fowl), they are different dishes with distinct preparation methods and possibly
  varying ingredients. Broth is a liquid preparation made by simmering bones, meat,
  or vegetables, while soup typically includes additional ingredients like vegetables,
  grains, or legumes. Merging them would disregard the differences in their composition
  and preparation.
