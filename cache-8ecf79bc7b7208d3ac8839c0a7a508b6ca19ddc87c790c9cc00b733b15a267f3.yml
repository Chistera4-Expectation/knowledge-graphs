text: ' No. Linden honey and raspberry honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
  While they both fall under the category of "honey," they have different taste, color,
  and aroma profiles due to the nectar source plants (linden tree vs. raspberry plant).
  They also possess unique nutritional properties and health benefits derived from
  their distinct botanical origins. Therefore, it is essential to maintain them as
  separate entities within the dietary context.'
