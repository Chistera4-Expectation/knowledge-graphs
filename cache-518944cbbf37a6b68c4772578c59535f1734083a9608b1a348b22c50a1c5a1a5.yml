text: ' No. While both Blue Cheese Dressing and Greek Dressing are types of salad
  dressings, they have distinct differences in terms of their ingredients and flavors.
  Blue Cheese Dressing is made with blue cheese, mayonnaise, buttermilk, vinegar,
  and spices, while Greek Dressing typically includes olive oil, lemon juice, garlic,
  oregano, and other herbs and spices. Therefore, they should not be considered semantic
  or ontologic duplicates.'
