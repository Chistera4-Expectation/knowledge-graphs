  While both "Protein per serving" and "Sugar per serving" provide information about
  nutritional content, they are not semantic or ontological duplicates because they
  represent different macronutrients with distinct roles and effects on health. Proteins
  are essential for growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues, while sugars
  (carbohydrates) serve as a primary energy source. Merging them would result in loss
  of specificity and hinder clear understanding of each nutrient''s contribution to
  cheese''s overall nutritional profile.'
