text: No, they should not be merged. Monkfish and Sashimi-grade fish are different
  types of fish with distinct characteristics and uses. Monkfish is a specific type
  of fish, while Sashimi-grade fish refers to fish suitable for sashimi preparation.
  Although both may be considered edible fish, they are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
