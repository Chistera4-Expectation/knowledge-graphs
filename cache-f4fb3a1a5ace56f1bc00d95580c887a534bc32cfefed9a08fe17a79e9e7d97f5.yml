text: No, they should not be merged as they represent different poultry-derived food
  preparations. "Pheasant Soup" refers to a soup made with pheasant meat, while "Pheasant
  Tenders" refers to a specific cut of pheasant meat, typically from the breast. While
  they are both derived from pheasant, they are distinct dishes and should be treated
  as separate instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
