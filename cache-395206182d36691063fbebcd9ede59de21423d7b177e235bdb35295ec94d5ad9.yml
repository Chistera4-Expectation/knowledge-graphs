text: ' No, hemp seeds and quinoa seeds are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While they are both types of seeds, they come from different plants (hemp vs quinoa)
  and have distinct nutritional profiles. Therefore, it is important to keep them
  separate when discussing their respective benefits and applications in a dietary
  context.'
