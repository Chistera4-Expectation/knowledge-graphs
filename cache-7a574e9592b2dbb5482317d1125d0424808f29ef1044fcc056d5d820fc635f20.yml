  Although both "Guinea Fowl Meat" and "Guinea Fowl Patties" are derived from the
  same bird, they are different food products. "Guinea Fowl Meat" refers to the raw
  or cooked muscle tissue from the bird, while "Guinea Fowl Patties" are a specific
  preparation of ground guinea fowl meat, typically formed into patties for cooking.
  These are distinct food items and should not be considered duplicates.
