  While both are derived from chicken and have the bone removed, "boneless chicken"
  is a more general term that can include various cuts of chicken, while "boneless,
  skinless chicken breasts" refers specifically to chicken breasts with both the bone
  and skin removed. These are distinct types of poultry-derived food and should be
  kept separate in a classification system.
