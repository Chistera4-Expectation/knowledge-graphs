text: No, Monkfish and Swordfish should not be merged together as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are fish and can be part of a diet, they are different species
  with distinct characteristics, nutritional profiles, and culinary uses. Merging
  them together would lead to a loss of specific information about each fish.
