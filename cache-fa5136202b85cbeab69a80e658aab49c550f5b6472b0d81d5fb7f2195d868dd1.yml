text: ' No. While "Mozzarella cheese" and a "serving size of Mozzarella cheese" may
  have some similar properties (such as being types of cheese), they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates because they refer to different concepts. A serving size
  refers to a specific amount of food, while mozzarella cheese is a type of dairy
  product with its own unique characteristics and uses. Merging these two instances
  would result in a loss of meaningful distinctions between them.'
