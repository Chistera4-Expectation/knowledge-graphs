text: No, Coconut Oil and Flaxseed Oil should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates because they have distinct chemical compositions, properties,
  and uses. Coconut Oil is rich in saturated fats, while Flaxseed Oil is high in polyunsaturated
  fats and omega-3 fatty acids. They serve different purposes in cooking, baking,
  and health applications.
