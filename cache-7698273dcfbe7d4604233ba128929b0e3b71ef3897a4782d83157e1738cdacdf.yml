  While both "cooked rice" and "short-grain rice" are types of rice, they do not represent
  the same concept and therefore should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.


  "Short-grain rice" is a type of rice that refers to rice grains that are short and
  plump with rounded ends, typically used for sushi, risotto, and other dishes where
  a sticky texture is desired. On the other hand, "cooked rice" refers to any type
  of rice that has been cooked by adding water and heating it until the rice absorbs
  the liquid and becomes soft and edible. Therefore, "cooked rice" can refer to many
  different varieties of rice, including long-grain, basmati, jasmine, and short-grain
  rice.


  Merging these two concepts would result in a loss of specificity and could lead
  to confusion when using or interpreting the data.'
