text: As a dietician, I would not advise merging 'Parmesan cheese' and 'Pecorino Romano
  cheese' as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of hard
  cheese, they have distinct differences in taste, texture, production methods, and
  ingredients. Parmesan is made from cow's milk, while Pecorino Romano is made from
  sheep's milk, which affects their flavor profiles. They also have different aging
  processes and nutritional compositions. Merging them as duplicates would not accurately
  represent their unique qualities and uses in various cuisines.
