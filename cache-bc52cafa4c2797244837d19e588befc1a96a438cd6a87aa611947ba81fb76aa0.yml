text: No, Black Rice and Brown Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. While they share some similarities, they are distinct types of rice
  with different nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Black Rice, also known as
  Forbidden Rice, has a higher nutrient content than Brown Rice and is often used
  for its distinct flavor and color in dishes. Brown Rice, on the other hand, is a
  more common type of rice and is a staple in many diets for its nutritional value
  and versatility in cooking.
