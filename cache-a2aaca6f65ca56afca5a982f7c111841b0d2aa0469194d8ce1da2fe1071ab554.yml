  In the context of a bakery, "gluten-free bread" and "sourdough bread" are distinct
  types of bread with different ingredients, textures, and flavors. Gluten-free bread
  is made without gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, while
  sourdough bread is made using a natural starter culture instead of commercial yeast.
  These differences make them unique products that cannot be considered duplicates.'
