text: No, these two instances should not be merged as they are not semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are used in cooking, they are distinct types of oils with
  different characteristics and uses. Sesame oil is a vegetable oil derived from sesame
  seeds and is typically used for its nutty aroma, while ghee is a type of clarified
  butter used in Indian cuisine for cooking.
