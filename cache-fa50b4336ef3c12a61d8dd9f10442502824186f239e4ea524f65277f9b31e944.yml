text: No, Herbal Tea and Oolong Tea should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are types of tea, they differ in their composition,
  origin, and processing methods. Herbal tea is not derived from the tea plant (Camellia
  sinensis), while Oolong Tea is a semi-oxidized tea made from the tea plant. These
  differences make them distinct types of tea and should be treated as separate instances
  in the Tea class.
