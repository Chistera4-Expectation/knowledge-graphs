text: No, Almond Milk and Buffalo Milk should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although both are types of milk, they come from different
  sources (almonds and buffalo) and have different nutritional profiles. Merging them
  together would not accurately represent the differences between these two types
  of milk.
