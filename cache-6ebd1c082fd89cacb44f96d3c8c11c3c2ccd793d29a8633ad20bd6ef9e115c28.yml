  While both chicken salad and chicken wings are poultry-derived foods, they have
  different preparations and nutritional profiles. Chicken salad typically consists
  of chopped or shredded chicken mixed with mayonnaise, celery, onions, and other
  ingredients, while chicken wings are usually deep-fried or baked and served with
  various sauces. Merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates would not accurately
  reflect their distinct culinary identities and uses.'
