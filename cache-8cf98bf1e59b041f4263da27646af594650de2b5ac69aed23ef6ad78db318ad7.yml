text: No, they should not be merged together as they have distinct differences in
  flavor and appearance. Freshly ground black pepper has a stronger flavor and is
  dark in color, while ground white pepper has a milder flavor and is light in color.
  Additionally, they are not semantic duplicates as they serve different purposes
  in cooking and can be used in different dishes.
