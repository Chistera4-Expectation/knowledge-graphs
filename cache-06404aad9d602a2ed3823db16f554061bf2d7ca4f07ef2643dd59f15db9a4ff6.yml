text: No, they should not be merged together. Turkey Stock and Turkey are different
  instances within the Poultry-derived Food class. Turkey Stock is a liquid made from
  simmering turkey bones, while Turkey refers to the meat of the bird itself. They
  have distinct properties and uses, so they should not be considered semantic or
  ontologic duplicates.
