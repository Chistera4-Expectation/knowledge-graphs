  While kiwi seeds and sunflower seeds are both types of edible seeds, they have distinct
  nutritional profiles and characteristics that make them unique from one another.
  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. Instead, they should each be treated as separate entities
  with their own set of properties and relationships within the context of the dietetics
  domain.'
