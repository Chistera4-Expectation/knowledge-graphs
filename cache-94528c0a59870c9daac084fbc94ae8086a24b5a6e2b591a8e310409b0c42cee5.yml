text: No, the 'Black Trumpet Mushroom' and 'Blewit Mushroom' should not be merged
  together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although both are edible mushrooms,
  they belong to different genera and have distinct characteristics, appearances,
  and culinary uses. They should be considered as separate instances within the Edible
  Mushrooms class.
