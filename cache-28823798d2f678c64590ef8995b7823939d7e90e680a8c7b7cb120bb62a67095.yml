text: As a dietician, my focus is on the nutritional aspects of ingredients. From
  a nutritional standpoint, dried oregano and oregano are essentially the same thing,
  as they both refer to the same plant (Origanum vulgare) and share similar nutritional
  profiles. However, they might differ in the way they are used in recipes, and they
  may have slightly different flavor profiles due to the drying process. Therefore,
  while they can be considered semantically and ontologically similar, it may be beneficial
  to keep them as separate instances in some contexts.
