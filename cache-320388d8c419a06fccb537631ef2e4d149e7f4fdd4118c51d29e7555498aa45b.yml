text: ' No, catfish and dry fish cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates
  and should not be merged. They are distinct types of edible fish with different
  characteristics. Catfish refers to various species of freshwater and marine fish
  that belong to the order Siluriformes, while dry fish is a term used for preserving
  fish by drying it out as a method of food preparation and storage. Therefore, they
  represent separate concepts within the domain of edible fish.'
