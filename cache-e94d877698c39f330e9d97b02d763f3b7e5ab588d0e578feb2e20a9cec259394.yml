text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although
  both are derived from guinea fowl, they are different food products with distinct
  preparation methods and nutritional profiles. Guinea Fowl Nuggets are typically
  fried or baked, while Guinea Fowl Soup is a liquid-based dish. These differences
  in preparation and composition result in variations in nutritional content and caloric
  value.
