  While both Creamy Garlic Dressing and Greek Yogurt Dressing can be categorized under
  the broader concept of "Salad Dressings," they are not semantic nor ontological
  duplicates. They have distinct ingredients (creamy garlic dressing typically includes
  cream and garlic while Greek yogurt dressing is made with Greek yogurt) and nutritional
  profiles. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two concepts together.'
