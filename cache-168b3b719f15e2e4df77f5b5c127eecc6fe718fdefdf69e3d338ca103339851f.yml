text: ' No. Jasmine rice and rice paper wrappers are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  despite both being made from rice. They serve different culinary purposes and have
  distinct nutritional profiles. Merging them would cause confusion, as they belong
  to separate categories within the domain of rice products.'
