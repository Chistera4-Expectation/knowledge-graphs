text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontologic duplicates. While both
  are derived from guinea fowl, they are distinct types of food with different nutritional
  compositions and culinary uses. Guinea fowl broth is a liquid made by simmering
  guinea fowl bones, meat, and vegetables, while guinea fowl meat is the edible flesh
  of the bird. They serve different purposes in a diet and should be treated as separate
  entities in the Poultry-derived Food class.
