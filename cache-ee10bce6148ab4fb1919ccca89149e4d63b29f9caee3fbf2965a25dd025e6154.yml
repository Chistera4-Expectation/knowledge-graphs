  While chili paste and tamarind paste are both food seasonings, they have different
  ingredients, flavors, and uses in cooking. Chili paste is typically made from crushed
  chilies, vinegar, oil, and spices, which gives it a spicy flavor profile. Tamarind
  paste, on the other hand, is made from the pulp of tamarind fruit, water, and sometimes
  sugar or salt, resulting in a sour-sweet taste. Therefore, they cannot be considered
  semantic or ontological duplicates.'
