  Low-sodium chicken broth and turkey chili are not semantic and ontological duplicates
  because they refer to two distinct types of poultry-derived food products with different
  ingredients, preparation methods, and uses. Low-sodium chicken broth is typically
  made by simmering chicken bones, vegetables, herbs, and spices in water for several
  hours to extract flavor, then straining out solids and reducing sodium content.
  On the other hand, turkey chili is a hearty stew made from ground turkey meat cooked
  with various seasonings, beans, tomatoes, peppers, and sometimes additional vegetables
  like onions and garlic. While both may contain some similar ingredients, such as
  chicken or turkey, their final form, taste, texture, and nutritional profiles differ
  significantly. Therefore, low-sodium chicken broth and turkey chili should not be
  considered semantic and ontological duplicates.'
