  The instance ": The base ingredient of the sauce" represents a single ingredient
  used in making a sauce, while "Sauces" is a more general category that can include
  multiple sauces with different ingredients and characteristics. Therefore, they
  are not semantic nor ontological duplicates and should remain separate.'
