text: No, "Fried onions" and "Onion slices" should not be merged as semantic and ontological
  duplicates. Although both are made from onions, they differ in their preparation
  and can have different nutritional values due to the cooking method. Therefore,
  they should be treated as separate instances in the Edible Vegetable class.
