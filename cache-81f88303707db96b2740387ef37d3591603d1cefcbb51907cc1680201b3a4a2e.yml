text: ' No. While both Wine and Rice Wine are types of alcoholic drinks, they differ
  significantly in their ingredients, production methods, and cultural significance.
  Therefore, it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates.
  Wine is typically made from fermented grapes, while Rice Wine is made from fermented
  rice. These differences result in distinct flavors, textures, and uses for each
  type of drink. Additionally, they have different historical and cultural associations
  that contribute to their unique identities.'
