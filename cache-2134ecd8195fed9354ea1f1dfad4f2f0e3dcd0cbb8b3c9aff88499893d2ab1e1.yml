  While chili paste and chili bean paste are similar in that they both contain chilies
  and are used for seasoning, they have different ingredients and flavors. Chili paste
  typically consists of ground chilies and other spices, while chili bean paste is
  made from fermented soybeans, chilies, and spices. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge these two concepts as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
