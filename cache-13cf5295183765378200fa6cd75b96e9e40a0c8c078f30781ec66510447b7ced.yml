text: ' Among the options you provided, the most adequate class for "Nuts" would be
  "Edible Seeds". Although commonly referred to as nuts, botanically speaking, tree
  nuts are actually considered seeds of a fruit. Therefore, grouping them with other
  edible seeds is more accurate from a scientific perspective.'
