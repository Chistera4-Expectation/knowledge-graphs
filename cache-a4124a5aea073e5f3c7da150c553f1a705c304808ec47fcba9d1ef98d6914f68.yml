  While garlic paste and chili bean paste may both be considered food seasonings,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have different ingredients
  (garlic vs. chili beans), flavors, textures, uses, and cultural origins. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge them as duplicates from either a semantic or
  an ontological standpoint.'
