text: ' No. Dark brown sugar and granulated white sugar are not semantic and ontological
  duplicates, despite having some similarities as sweeteners. They have different
  chemical compositions, flavors, colors, uses in cooking and nutrition profiles.
  Therefore, they should be treated as separate entities in a well-structured classification
  system for sweeteners.'
