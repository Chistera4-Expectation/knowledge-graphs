text: No, boiling water and soft water should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. They are different types of water with distinct characteristics
  and purposes. Boiling water is a method of purification and sterilization, while
  soft water is a type of water with lower mineral content, which makes it easier
  to work with for cleaning and other applications.
