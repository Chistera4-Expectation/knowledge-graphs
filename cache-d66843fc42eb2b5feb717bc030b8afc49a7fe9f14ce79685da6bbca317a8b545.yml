  While both "chicken salad" and "grilled chicken" are types of poultry-derived food,
  they have distinct characteristics and uses that warrant them to be treated as separate
  entities. Chicken salad typically refers to cooked chicken mixed with various ingredients
  such as mayonnaise, celery, onions, and spices, often served cold or at room temperature.
  Grilled chicken, on the other hand, is simply chicken meat that has been cooked
  on a grill, usually seasoned but not necessarily combined with any additional ingredients.
  Therefore, merging these two instances would not accurately reflect their unique
  properties and applications.'
