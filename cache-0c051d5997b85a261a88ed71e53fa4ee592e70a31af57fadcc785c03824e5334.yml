  While both ground crayfish and imitation crab meat can be used in similar ways in
  cooking (as ingredients in various dishes), they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Ground crayfish is made from real crayfish that have been cooked and
  processed into a paste or powder, while imitation crab meat is typically made from
  surimi, which is made from pulverized white fish and other ingredients to mimic
  the taste and texture of crab meat. Therefore, they belong to different categories
  of edible crustaceans and should not be merged as duplicates.'
