  While ginger paste is made from grated or finely chopped ginger that has been mixed
  with water or oil to form a smooth paste, it is not a semantic or ontological duplicate
  of fresh ginger. Ginger paste is a processed form of ginger that may have different
  culinary uses, nutritional content, and storage requirements than fresh ginger.
  Therefore, they are distinct food seasonings that warrant separate classification.'
