text: ' Based on its nutritional content, the most adequate class for "Dark Chocolate
  Shavings" would be "Edible Vegetable." Although it is often categorized as a sweet
  or dessert item, dark chocolate contains high amounts of antioxidants and flavonoids
  due to its cocoa solids. These compounds are commonly found in vegetables, making
  this classification more suitable from a health perspective.'
