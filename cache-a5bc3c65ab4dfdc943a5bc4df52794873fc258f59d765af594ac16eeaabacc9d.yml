text: No, Soybean Oil and Wheat Germ Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  distinct chemical compositions, properties, and uses in food preparation. Soybean
  Oil is derived from soybeans and has a high content of polyunsaturated fats, while
  Wheat Germ Oil is derived from the germ of wheat and has a high content of vitamin
  E and essential fatty acids. Merging them together would not accurately represent
  the differences between these two oils.
