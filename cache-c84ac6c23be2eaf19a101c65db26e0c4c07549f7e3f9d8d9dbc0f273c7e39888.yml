  While both fresh fish and sashimi-grade fish are types of edible fish, they have
  different qualities that make them suitable for specific uses. Fresh fish refers
  to any fish that has been recently caught or properly refrigerated after being caught.
  Sashimi-grade fish, on the other hand, is a higher quality designation given to
  fish that meets strict requirements for freshness, handling, and sourcing, making
  it safe and ideal for eating raw, like in sushi or sashimi dishes. Merging these
  two concepts would disregard their unique distinctions and applications.'
