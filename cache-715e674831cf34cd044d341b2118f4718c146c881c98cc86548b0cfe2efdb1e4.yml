text: No, Cornstarch and Pickled Mustard Greens should not be merged together as they
  are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Cornstarch is a starch extracted from
  the endosperm of corn, while Pickled Mustard Greens are a fermented vegetable dish
  made from mustard greens. They have different properties, uses, and nutritional
  values.
