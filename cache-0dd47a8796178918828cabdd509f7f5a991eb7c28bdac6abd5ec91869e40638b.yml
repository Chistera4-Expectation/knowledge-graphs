text: No, "Duck Liver" and "Duck Sausage" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. They are different food items derived from ducks, with
  distinct nutritional profiles and preparation methods. While they both fall under
  the Poultry-derived Food class, they are not duplicates.
