  While both diced tomatoes and tomato sauce are types of tomato products, they have
  different culinary uses and nutritional profiles. Diced tomatoes typically consist
  of chopped tomatoes packed in their own juice, making them a chunkier ingredient
  with more fiber and less processed than tomato sauce. Tomato sauce is made by cooking
  and straining tomatoes to create a smooth puree that can serve as a base for various
  dishes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
