text: No, they should not be merged as they have different ingredients, preparation
  methods, and uses. Mole sauce is a complex, rich, and flavorful sauce originating
  from Mexico, often made with a combination of chili peppers, nuts, spices, and chocolate.
  On the other hand, Tempura Dipping Sauce is a lighter, more delicate sauce typically
  made with dashi (Japanese soup stock), mirin (sweet rice wine), soy sauce, and sugar,
  used for dipping tempura fried foods in Japanese cuisine. Although both are sauces,
  they have distinct characteristics that make them unique.
