text: As a dietician, I would not merge these two instances as they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of peppers, they have different
  heat levels and flavors. Red pepper flakes are typically made from dried and crushed
  red chili peppers, while Scotch Bonnet Peppers are a specific variety of chili pepper
  with a distinct fruity flavor and high heat level. Merging them would not accurately
  represent the differences between these ingredients.
