text: No, Buffalo Milk and Camel Milk should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of milk, they come from different
  animal sources (buffalo and camel, respectively) and have distinct nutritional profiles
  and properties. Merging them together would lose this important information.
