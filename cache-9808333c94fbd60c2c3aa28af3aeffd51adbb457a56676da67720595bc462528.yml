text: No, they should not be merged as semantic and ontological duplicates. Although
  both are yogurt types, they have distinct properties, such as texture, fat content,
  and production methods. Creamy yogurt typically has a higher fat content and a smoother
  texture, while Greek yogurt is thicker and has a higher protein content due to straining.
