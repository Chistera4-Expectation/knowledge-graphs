text: No, the instances 'Goat meat' and 'Pheasant Meatballs' should not be merged
  together as they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. Goat meat is derived
  from goats, while pheasant meatballs are derived from pheasants and include additional
  ingredients such as seasonings and bread crumbs. They are different types of poultry-derived
  food and should be treated as separate instances.
