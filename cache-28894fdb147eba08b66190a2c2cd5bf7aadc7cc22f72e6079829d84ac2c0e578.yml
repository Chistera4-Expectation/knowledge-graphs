  While both ground beef and organic beef are types of beef, they have different characteristics
  that make them distinct from one another. Ground beef can come from conventionally
  raised cattle and is made by grinding together various cuts of meat. On the other
  hand, organic beef must meet specific USDA standards for how the animals were raised
  (such as being fed organic feed and not given antibiotics or hormones), but it does
  not necessarily indicate anything about how the meat was processed (i.e., whether
  it was ground). Therefore, these two terms cannot be considered semantic or ontological
  duplicates.'
