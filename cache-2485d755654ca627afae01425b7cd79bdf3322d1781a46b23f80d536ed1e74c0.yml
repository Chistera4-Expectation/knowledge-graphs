  The two instances, "Red bell pepper, sliced" and "Scotch bonnet peppers," are not
  identical in their characteristics, even though they belong to the same class of
  edible vegetables. The first instance refers to a specific variety of sweet pepper
  that has been sliced for use in cooking, while the second instance is a type of
  hot pepper with a distinct flavor and texture. They have different culinary uses
  and nutritional profiles, so it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic
  and ontological duplicates.'
