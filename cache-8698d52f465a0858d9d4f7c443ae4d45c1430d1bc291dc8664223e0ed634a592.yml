  Marinara sauce and Tomato sauce may share some common ingredients, such as tomatoes,
  but they have different preparation methods and uses. Marinara sauce typically includes
  additional ingredients like onions, garlic, and herbs, and is often used as a pasta
  sauce or pizza topping. Tomato sauce, on the other hand, is generally a simpler
  sauce made primarily from tomatoes, often used as a base for other sauces or as
  a condiment. Therefore, they should be treated as distinct instances in the Sauce
  class.
