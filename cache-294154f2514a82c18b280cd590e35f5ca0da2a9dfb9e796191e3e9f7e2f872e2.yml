text: 'As a dietician, I can provide an opinion based on the context of nutrition
  and health. From a nutritional standpoint, ''Ginger Tea'' and ''Infused Tea'' are
  not necessarily semantic or ontologic duplicates.


  Ginger Tea is a type of infused tea that specifically uses ginger as the main ingredient.
  Ginger has various health benefits, such as aiding digestion, reducing inflammation,
  and relieving nausea. In this context, Ginger Tea would be a subcategory of Infused
  Tea.


  Infused Tea, on the other hand, refers to any tea that is made by steeping various
  herbs, spices, or other ingredients in hot water. This can include ginger, but also
  other ingredients like chamomile, mint, or lavender. Infused Tea can have different
  health benefits depending on the ingredients used.


  In conclusion, while Ginger Tea is a type of Infused Tea, they are not semantic
  or ontologic duplicates, as they have different nutritional and health properties.
  However, if the discussion is purely about the tea preparation method, then they
  could be considered as the same. It ultimately depends on the context of the discussion.'
