text: No, Greek Yogurt and Plain Yogurt should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While they are both types of yogurt, they have distinct characteristics
  and nutritional profiles. Greek yogurt is strained to remove much of the whey, resulting
  in a thicker consistency and higher protein content. Plain yogurt, on the other
  hand, is not strained and retains more of its whey, making it thinner in consistency
  and often lower in protein.
