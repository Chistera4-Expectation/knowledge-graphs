text: No, they should not be merged as they are different types of stocks made from
  different types of poultry. Guinea fowl stock is made from guinea fowl, while chicken/vegetable
  stock is made from chicken and vegetables. They may be similar in some ways, but
  they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates.
