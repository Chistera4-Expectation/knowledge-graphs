text: 'As a dietician, I can provide insights from a nutritional perspective, but
  the classification of water sources is not directly related to my field. However,
  I can offer some information:


  Spring water and well water are not considered semantic and ontologic duplicates
  because they have distinct differences in their origins and collection methods.


  Spring water is naturally filtered by the earth as it flows to the surface, while
  well water is pumped from underground aquifers. Although both are sourced from the
  ground, their compositions and quality can vary.


  In terms of nutrition, both spring water and well water are generally considered
  safe and healthy sources of hydration. However, the specific mineral content and
  water quality can depend on factors like geological location and water treatment
  processes.


  Ultimately, the decision to merge or maintain separate categories for spring water
  and well water would be based on the context and purpose of the classification system,
  rather than purely nutritional considerations.'
