text: " No.\n\nWhile both grapeseed oil and walnut oil are types of edible vegetable\
  \ oils, they have distinct differences in terms of their nutritional profiles, taste,\
  \ and uses in cooking. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic\
  \ and ontological duplicates.\n\nGrapeseed oil is extracted from the seeds of grapes\
  \ and has a light, neutral flavor with a high smoke point (around 420\xB0F), making\
  \ it suitable for saut\xE9ing, frying, and baking. It is also rich in vitamin E\
  \ and omega-6 fatty acids but low in saturated fats.\n\nOn the other hand, walnut\
  \ oil is pressed from the nuts of walnut trees and has a strong, distinctive nutty\
  \ flavor that makes it ideal for salad dressings, marinades, and drizzling over\
  \ finished dishes. Walnut oil contains heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, polyunsaturated\
  \ fats including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) - an essential omega-3 fatty acid, and\
  \ antioxidants like ellagitannins. However, its smoke point is relatively low (about\
  \ 320\xB0F), which means it can easily burn when exposed to high heat.\n\nSince\
  \ these two oils have different flavors, nutritional compositions, and culinary\
  \ applications, merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates would result\
  \ in loss of valuable information and nuance in understanding each individual type\
  \ of oil."
