text: ' No. Orange Blossom honey and Sage honey are not semantic or ontological duplicates,
  even though they are both types of honey. They have distinct botanical origins which
  impact their taste, color, and consistency, among other properties. Therefore, it
  is important to differentiate between them based on these unique characteristics.'
