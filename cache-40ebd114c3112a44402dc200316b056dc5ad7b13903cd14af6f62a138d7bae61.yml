text: No, the instances 'Hen of the Woods Mushroom' and 'Morel Mushroom' should not
  be merged together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. These two mushrooms are
  different species with distinct characteristics, appearances, and culinary uses.
  Hen of the Woods (Grifola frondosa) is a large, fan-shaped mushroom that grows at
  the base of trees, while Morel (Morchella spp.) is a smaller, honeycomb-shaped mushroom
  that grows in forests and fields.
