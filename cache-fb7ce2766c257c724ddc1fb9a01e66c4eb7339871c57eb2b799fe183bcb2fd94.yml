text: No, Red Rice and Sticky Rice should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. While both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics and
  uses. Red Rice is a whole grain rice variety with a nutty flavor and chewy texture,
  often used in salads or as a side dish. Sticky Rice, also known as glutinous rice,
  has a higher starch content, making it sticky and moist, and it is commonly used
  in Asian cuisine for dishes like sushi and desserts.
