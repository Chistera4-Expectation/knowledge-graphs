text: ' No. While "Name of the cheese" could be considered a more general category
  that includes "Pecorino Romano cheese," they are not exact duplicates because "Name
  of the cheese" is too broad and vague, whereas "Pecorino Romano cheese" refers to
  a specific type of Italian sheep milk cheese with protected designation of origin
  (PDO) status. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to merge them as semantic and
  ontological duplicates.'
