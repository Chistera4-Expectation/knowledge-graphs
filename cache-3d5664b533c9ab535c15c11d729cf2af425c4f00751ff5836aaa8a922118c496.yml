      the category of items that are "intended for consumption," the most adequate
      class to encompass these diverse examples would indeed be `Edible`. In a programming
      context, where you''re structuring data for software related to nutrition, grocery
      inventory, meal planning, or similar purposes, the `Edible` class acts as a
      broad categorization that captures the essence of all items that can be safely
      and nutritiously consumed by humans.
