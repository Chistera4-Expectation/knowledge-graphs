  While both avocado dressing and Greek yogurt dressing can be categories of food
  dressings, they are not semantic nor ontological duplicates. They have different
  ingredients, flavors, textures, nutritional profiles, and uses in recipes. Merging
  them would result in loss of important distinctions that are relevant for culinary
  and nutrition purposes.'
