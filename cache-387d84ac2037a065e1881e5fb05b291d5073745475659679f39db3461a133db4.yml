text: No, 'Pheasant Gizzards' and 'Turkey Gizzards' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both poultry-derived food
  items, they come from different types of birds (pheasant and turkey) and therefore
  have distinct nutritional profiles and culinary applications.
