text: ' No. Tomato slices and tomato are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  While tomato slices are made from tomatoes and share many of their nutritional properties,
  they have different physical attributes (such as shape and size) that make them
  distinct entities. Additionally, recipes may call for specific forms like "tomato
  slices" instead of just "tomatoes," indicating that these terms refer to slightly
  different things within the context of edible vegetables.'
