  While BBQ spice and five-spice powder may both fall under the category of food seasonings,
  they are not semantic or ontological duplicates. They have distinct ingredients,
  uses, and cultural origins. BBQ spice is typically associated with American barbecue
  cuisine and contains ingredients like paprika, salt, garlic powder, and sometimes
  sugar. Five-spice powder, on the other hand, is a staple in Chinese cooking and
  consists of star anise, cloves, cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, and fennel seeds. Therefore,
  it would not be appropriate to merge these two instances as duplicates.'
