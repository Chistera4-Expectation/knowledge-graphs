  Although both are types of rice, they have distinct characteristics and properties.
  Japonica rice is a short-grain rice commonly used in Japanese cuisine, while Red
  rice is a whole grain rice that is high in fiber and has a nutty flavor. They should
  be treated as separate entities in a rice classification system.
