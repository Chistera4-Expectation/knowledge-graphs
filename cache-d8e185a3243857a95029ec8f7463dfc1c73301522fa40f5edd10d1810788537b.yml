text: As a dietician, my answer is based on nutritional and culinary aspects rather
  than ontology or semantics. While dried Cameroon pepper and red chili peppers share
  similarities, they are not identical. They have different flavors, heat levels,
  and culinary uses. So, I would not merge them as duplicates in this context. However,
  if you are referring to a classification system or database, the decision may depend
  on the specific criteria and goals of that system.
