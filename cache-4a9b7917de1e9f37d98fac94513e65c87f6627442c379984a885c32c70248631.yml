text: ' No. Fireweed honey and orange blossom honey are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates despite both being types of honey. They come from different flower sources
  (fireweed plant vs. citrus flowers) which gives them distinct flavor profiles, color,
  and other properties. Therefore, they should not be merged as duplicates but rather
  treated as separate varieties within the category of honey.'
