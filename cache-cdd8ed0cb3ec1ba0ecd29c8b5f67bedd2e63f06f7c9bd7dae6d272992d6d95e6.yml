text: As a dietician, I can provide an answer based on the culinary aspect, not necessarily
  the semantic and ontologic duplicates. From a culinary perspective, the Coral Shrimp
  and Shrimp (in general) are distinct types of shrimp with different flavors and
  textures. Therefore, they should not be merged as they serve different purposes
  in various dishes. However, if the question is about the biological classification,
  I recommend consulting a biologist or taxonomist for a more accurate answer.
