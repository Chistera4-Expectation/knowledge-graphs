text: No, Macadamia Nut Oil and Sunflower Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. They are different types of edible vegetable oils derived
  from different sources (macadamia nuts and sunflower seeds, respectively), and they
  have distinct properties, nutritional profiles, and uses.
