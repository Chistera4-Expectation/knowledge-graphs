text: No, Macadamia Nut Oil and Palm Oil should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both edible vegetable oils, they have
  different properties, sources, and uses. Macadamia Nut Oil is a nut-based oil with
  a high smoke point, used primarily for cooking and as a finishing oil. Palm Oil,
  on the other hand, is derived from the fruit of the oil palm tree and is widely
  used in food manufacturing, cosmetics, and biofuel production. These differences
  in characteristics and applications make them distinct entities within the class
  of edible vegetable oils.
