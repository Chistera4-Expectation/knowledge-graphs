text: ' No. Cottonseed oil and flaxseed oil are not semantic and ontological duplicates,
  and they should not be merged together. Although both oils come from seeds and are
  used for similar purposes, they have different nutritional profiles and uses that
  make them distinct. For example, cottonseed oil has a higher smoke point than flaxseed
  oil, making it suitable for high-heat cooking methods like frying, while flaxseed
  oil is richer in omega-3 fatty acids and is often used as a dietary supplement.
  Therefore, it is important to maintain separate categories for these two types of
  edible vegetable oils.'
