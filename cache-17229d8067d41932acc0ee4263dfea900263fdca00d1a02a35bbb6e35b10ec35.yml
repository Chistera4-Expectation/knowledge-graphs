  While both ''Oyster mushrooms'' and ''Sliced shiitake mushrooms'' are types of edible
  mushrooms, they belong to different species and have distinct characteristics. Oyster
  mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) are known for their delicate flavor and tender texture,
  while sliced shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes) have a rich, earthy flavor and
  meaty texture. They can be used in different culinary applications and have different
  nutritional profiles, so it is not appropriate to merge them as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
