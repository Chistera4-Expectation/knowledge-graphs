text: No, Chili Powder and Red chili flakes should not be merged as semantic and ontologic
  duplicates. Although they are both derived from chili peppers, they have different
  textures, flavors, and uses in cooking. Chili Powder is a blend of dried and ground
  chili peppers with other spices, while Red chili flakes are simply dried and crushed
  chili peppers. They should be treated as separate ingredients in a recipe and cooking
  context.
