text: 'No, they should not be merged as they are distinct types of yogurt: Bulgarian
  Yogurt is a traditional dairy yogurt made with specific bacterial cultures, while
  Non-Dairy Yogurt is made from plant-based alternatives and does not contain any
  dairy. While both are types of yogurt, they have different ingredients and nutritional
  profiles.'
