text: No, they should not be merged together as they are different types of poultry-derived
  food with distinct characteristics and preparation methods. Although they are both
  derived from ostrich, the dish names "Ostrich Meatballs" and "Ostrich Wings" convey
  specific forms and cooking styles. Merging them would not accurately represent the
  variety of poultry-derived food options available.
