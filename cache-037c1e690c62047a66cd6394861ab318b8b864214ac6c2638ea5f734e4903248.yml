  While both Blueberry Honey and Tupelo Honey are types of honey, they have distinct
  differences based on their source and flavor profile. Therefore, they should not
  be considered semantic or ontological duplicates.


  Blueberry Honey is made from nectar collected by bees from blueberry flowers, resulting
  in a darker color and robust fruity taste. On the other hand, Tupelo Honey originates
  primarily from the nectar of tupelo gum trees, producing a light amber hue with
  a unique mildly sweet and slightly fruity flavor that is less intense than Blueberry
  Honey. Merging them would disregard these important distinctions between the two
  varieties.'
