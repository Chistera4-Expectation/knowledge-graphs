  Rooibos tea and white tea are two different types of tea, with distinct nutritional
  profiles and health benefits. While they are both herbal teas, they differ in terms
  of their composition, flavor profiles, and health effects. Therefore, it is not
  appropriate to merge them together as semantic and ontologic duplicates.'
