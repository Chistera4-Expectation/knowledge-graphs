  While canola oil and coconut oil are both types of edible vegetable oils, they have
  different nutritional profiles, sources, and uses. Canola oil is derived from rapeseed
  plants and is low in saturated fat, making it a heart-healthy option for cooking
  and baking. Coconut oil, on the other hand, is high in saturated fat and has gained
  popularity for its potential health benefits related to metabolism and immune function.
  However, more research is needed to fully understand these effects. Therefore, it
  would not be appropriate to merge canola oil and coconut oil as semantic and ontological
  duplicates.'
