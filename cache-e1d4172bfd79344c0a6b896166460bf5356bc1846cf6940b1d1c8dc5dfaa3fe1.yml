text: No, Mineral Water and Well Water should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontological duplicates. Although both are types of drinking water, they have different
  characteristics and sources. Mineral Water typically contains minerals and may undergo
  additional processing, while Well Water comes directly from a well and may not have
  the same mineral content.
