  Safflower oil and vegetable oil are different types of oils with distinct nutritional
  profiles and uses in cooking. Safflower oil is a healthier option with a higher
  smoke point, making it better suited for high-heat cooking methods like frying,
  while vegetable oil is a blend of various oils that may contain unhealthy trans
  fats and is generally less suitable for frying. Therefore, they should not be merged
  as semantic and ontological duplicates.'
