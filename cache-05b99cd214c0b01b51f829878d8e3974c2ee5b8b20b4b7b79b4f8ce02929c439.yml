text: No, the instances 'Cuban bread' and 'Pita bread' should not be merged together
  as semantic and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of bread, they
  have distinct characteristics, ingredients, and cultural origins that differentiate
  them from each other. Merging them would not accurately represent the variety of
  bread types and their unique attributes.
