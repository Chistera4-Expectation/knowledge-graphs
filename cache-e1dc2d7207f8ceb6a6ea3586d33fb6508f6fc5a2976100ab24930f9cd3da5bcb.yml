text: No, the instances 'Pickled ginger' and 'Pickled mustard greens' should not be
  merged together as semantic and ontological duplicates. While they are both pickled
  vegetables, they are distinct types of vegetables with different tastes, textures,
  and uses. Merging them together would not accurately represent the specific types
  of pickled vegetables and their unique characteristics.
