  While both "Chicken curry" and "Chicken pieces" are poultry-derived foods, they
  cannot be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they refer to different
  culinary preparations of chicken meat with distinct characteristics. Chicken curry
  is a dish that typically includes cooked chicken in a sauce made from various spices
  such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili peppers; it may also contain vegetables
  like bell peppers, onions, garlic, and ginger. On the other hand, "chicken pieces"
  simply refers to portions of raw or cooked chicken meat (e.g., breasts, thighs,
  drumsticks) without any specific preparation method or accompanying ingredients
  specified. Therefore, these two terms do not have identical meanings and cannot
  be treated as duplicates within the context of your question.'
