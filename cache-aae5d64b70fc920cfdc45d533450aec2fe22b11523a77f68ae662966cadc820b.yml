text: No, they should not be merged together as they are not semantic or ontological
  duplicates. Chicken meatballs are a specific dish made from ground chicken and other
  ingredients, while chicken/vegetable stock is a liquid broth made by simmering chicken
  and vegetable components. They are different food items and should be kept as separate
  instances within the Poultry-derived Food class.
