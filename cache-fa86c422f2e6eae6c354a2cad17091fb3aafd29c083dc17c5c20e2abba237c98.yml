  While both chicken breasts and chicken pieces are types of poultry meat, they cannot
  be considered semantic and ontological duplicates because they have different meanings
  and properties. Chicken breast is a specific cut from the chicken that has low fat
  content and high protein, while "chicken pieces" can refer to various cuts such
  as legs, thighs, wings, etc., which may differ in nutritional value compared to
  chicken breasts. Therefore, it is essential to maintain these distinctions for accurate
  food labeling, nutrition analysis, recipe development, and meal planning purposes.'
