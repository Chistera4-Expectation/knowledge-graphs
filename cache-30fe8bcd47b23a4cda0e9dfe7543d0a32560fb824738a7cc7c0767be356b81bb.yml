text: No, they should not be merged. Although both are types of rice, they have distinct
  characteristics and uses in culinary applications. Sticky rice is a type of glutinous
  rice used in various Asian dishes, while sushi rice is a short-grain rice specifically
  prepared for sushi with vinegar, sugar, and salt.
