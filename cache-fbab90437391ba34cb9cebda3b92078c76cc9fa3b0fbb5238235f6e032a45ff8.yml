text: No, Kefir Yogurt and Savory Yogurt should not be merged as they have different
  properties and characteristics. Kefir Yogurt is a fermented milk product made with
  kefir grains, while Savory Yogurt typically refers to yogurt flavored with savory
  ingredients such as herbs, spices, or vegetables. They are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
