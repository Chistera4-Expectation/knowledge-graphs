text: ' The most adequate class for "stabilizers" would be "Sauce." Sauces often contain
  stabilizers to help thicken and maintain the consistency of the sauce. While food
  dressings, seasonings, spices, and sweeteners may also contain stabilizers, they
  are not their primary function like in sauces.'
