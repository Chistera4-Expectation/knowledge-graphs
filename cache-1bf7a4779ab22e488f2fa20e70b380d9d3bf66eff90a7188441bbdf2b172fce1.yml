  While both "pickled ginger" and "sliced green onions" are edible vegetables, they
  have different flavors, textures, and uses in cooking. Pickled ginger is typically
  served as a side dish or used as an ingredient in sushi rolls, while sliced green
  onions are often used as a topping for soups, salads, and stir-fries. They can be
  considered distinct instances in the Edible Vegetable class.'
