text: ' A suitable "Optional" category could be "Additional Foods", which would include
  the following items from your list: Alcoholic Drink, Coffee, Energy Drink, Juice,
  Tea. These are all foods that people may choose to consume but can also have balanced
  diets without them. The rest of the food classes you provided (e.g., Beef, Bread,
  Breakfast Cereals) generally fall into larger categories like meats or grains and
  cannot be considered optional in the same way as these drinks.'
