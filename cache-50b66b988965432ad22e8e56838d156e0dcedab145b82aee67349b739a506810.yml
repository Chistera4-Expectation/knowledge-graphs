text: No, Alfalfa Honey and Dandelion Honey should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. Although they are both types of honey, they have distinct
  characteristics, flavors, and come from different plant sources (alfalfa and dandelion,
  respectively). Merging them would not accurately represent the unique qualities
  of each honey variety.
