text: ' No. Honey Mustard Dressing and Yogurt Dressing are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates. While both types of dressings may contain honey and yogurt as ingredients,
  they have distinct differences in their composition, taste profiles, and nutritional
  properties. Therefore, they should be kept as separate entities in a food classification
  system.'
