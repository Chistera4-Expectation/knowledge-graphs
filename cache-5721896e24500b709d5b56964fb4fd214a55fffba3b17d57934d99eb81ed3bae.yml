text: No, "Duck Drumsticks" and "Duck Gravy" should not be merged together as they
  are distinct food items derived from duck. Duck Drumsticks are a part of the duck,
  while Duck Gravy is a sauce typically made from the drippings or stock of cooked
  duck. They serve different purposes in a meal and are not semantic or ontologic
  duplicates.
