  While oyster sauce can be considered a type of sauce, it has unique characteristics
  that distinguish it from other sauces. Oyster sauce is made from oysters, water,
  and sometimes cornstarch, whereas not all sauces are made with these ingredients.
  Therefore, merging them as semantic and ontological duplicates would result in loss
  of important distinctions between different types of sauces. It is appropriate to
  keep them separate in this context.'
