  Chicken broth and chicken wings are two different types of food items, with distinct
  nutritional profiles and culinary uses. Chicken broth is a liquid made by simmering
  chicken bones and meat, while chicken wings are a type of meat cut from the wing
  joints of a chicken. They have different textures, flavors, and purposes in cooking.
  Therefore, they should not be considered semantic and ontological duplicates.'
