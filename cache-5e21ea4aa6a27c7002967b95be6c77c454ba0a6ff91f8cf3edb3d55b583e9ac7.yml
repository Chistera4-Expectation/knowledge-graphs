  While "Additional seasonings" is a general term that can refer to any type of seasoning
  added beyond the basic ones, "Greek Seasoning" refers specifically to a blend of
  herbs and spices commonly used in Greek cuisine. Therefore, they are not semantic
  or ontological duplicates and should not be merged together.'
