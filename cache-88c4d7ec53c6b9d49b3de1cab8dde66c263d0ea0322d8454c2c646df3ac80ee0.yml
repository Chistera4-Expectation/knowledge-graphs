text: No, Lion's Mane Mushroom and Mushrooms should not be merged as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. Lion's Mane Mushroom is a specific type of edible mushroom,
  while "Mushrooms" refers to the broader category of fungi that includes Lion's Mane
  Mushroom and many other types. Each type of mushroom has its own unique characteristics,
  nutritional profile, and potential health benefits. Merging them together would
  not accurately reflect their distinct properties and could lead to confusion.
