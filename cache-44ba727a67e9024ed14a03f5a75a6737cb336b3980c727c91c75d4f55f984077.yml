text: No, "Quail Drumsticks" and "Quail Nuggets" should not be merged as they are
  two distinct types of poultry-derived food, even though they both come from quail.
  The preparation and presentation of these two dishes are different, and they may
  cater to different dietary preferences or cooking methods.
