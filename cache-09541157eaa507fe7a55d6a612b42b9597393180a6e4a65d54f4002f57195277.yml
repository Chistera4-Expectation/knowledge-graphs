text: As a dietician, I would not consider "Noodles" and "Rice noodles" as semantic
  and ontological duplicates. While they both fall under the broader category of noodles,
  they are made from different ingredients (rice noodles are made from rice flour,
  while noodles can be made from wheat, rice, or other flours). Therefore, it is appropriate
  to have them as separate instances in the Pasta Types class.
