text: No, the instances 'Vegetable oil for frying' and 'Vegetables' should not be
  merged together as they represent different concepts. 'Vegetable oil for frying'
  refers to a type of oil derived from vegetables, while 'Vegetables' refers to the
  edible parts of plants. Although they are related, they are not duplicates and should
  be kept separate in the Edible Vegetable class.
