text: No, Amp Energy and Hype Energy should not be merged together as semantic and
  ontologic duplicates. While they both fall under the category of energy drinks,
  they are distinct brands with unique formulations, ingredients, and marketing strategies.
  Merging them would disregard these differences and create confusion.
