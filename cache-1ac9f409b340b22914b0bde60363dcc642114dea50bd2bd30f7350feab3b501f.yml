text: ' No. While both Blue Cheese Dressing and Yogurt Dressing are types of dressings,
  they have distinct characteristics and ingredients. Blue Cheese Dressing is made
  with blue cheese, may include other ingredients like buttermilk, sour cream, vinegar,
  and spices, and has a distinctive taste and texture due to the blue cheese. On the
  other hand, Yogurt Dressing is typically made with yogurt as its base ingredient,
  along with various seasonings and herbs, resulting in a tangy and slightly sweet
  flavor profile. Therefore, they cannot be considered semantic or ontologic duplicates.'
