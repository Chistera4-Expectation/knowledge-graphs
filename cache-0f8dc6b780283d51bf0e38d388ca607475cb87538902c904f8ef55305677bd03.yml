text: "No, the instances 'Fruit-Flavored Yogurt' and 'Skyr Yogurt' should not be merged\
  \ together as semantic and ontologic duplicates. \n\nWhile both are types of yogurt,\
  \ they have different characteristics. Fruit-flavored yogurt typically contains\
  \ added fruit or fruit flavorings, whereas Skyr Yogurt is an Icelandic-style yogurt\
  \ that is thicker and higher in protein than traditional yogurt. These distinctions\
  \ make them separate types of yogurt, and thus not duplicates."
