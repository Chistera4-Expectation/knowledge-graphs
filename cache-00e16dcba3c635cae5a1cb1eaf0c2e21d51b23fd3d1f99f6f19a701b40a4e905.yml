text: No, "Duck Nuggets" and "Duck Patties" should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While they both are derived from duck meat, they have
  different forms and preparation methods. Nuggets are typically small, bite-sized
  pieces of meat, often breaded and fried, while patties are flattened, round shapes
  of meat, usually grilled or pan-fried. These differences in form and preparation
  make them distinct instances in the Poultry-derived Food class.
