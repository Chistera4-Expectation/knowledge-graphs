text: Yes, from a semantic and ontological standpoint, the instances 'Potato' and
  'Potatoes' can be considered duplicates and should be merged together, as they refer
  to the same edible vegetable. However, it's essential to maintain the singular and
  plural forms for proper usage and grammar in context.
