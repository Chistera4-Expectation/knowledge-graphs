  Heather honey and raspberry honey are both types of honey, but they have different
  properties and come from different sources. Heather honey is made by bees that gather
  nectar from heather plants, while raspberry honey is made from the nectar of raspberries.
  These two honeys differ in terms of their taste, color, consistency, and nutritional
  content due to their distinct botanical origins. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
  to merge them as semantic and ontological duplicates since they represent unique
  subcategories within the broader category of honey.'
