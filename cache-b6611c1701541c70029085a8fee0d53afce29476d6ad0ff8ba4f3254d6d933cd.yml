text: No, distilled water and glacier water are not semantic and ontological duplicates.
  They have different origins and methods of production. Distilled water is produced
  by boiling water and condensing the steam, while glacier water comes from melting
  glaciers. Although they are both forms of drinking water, they have distinct properties
  and should not be merged as duplicates.
