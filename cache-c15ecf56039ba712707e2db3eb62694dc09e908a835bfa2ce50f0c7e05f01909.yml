text: No, Flaxseed Milk and Lactose-free Milk should not be merged together as semantic
  and ontologic duplicates. While both are milk alternatives, they have different
  ingredients and nutritional profiles. Flaxseed Milk is made from flaxseeds and is
  a plant-based milk alternative, while Lactose-free Milk is regular cow's milk with
  the lactose removed for individuals with lactose intolerance. They have different
  nutritional values and should be kept separate in the Milk class.
