  As a dietitian, I can explain that Buckwheat honey and Eucalyptus honey are different
  types of honey with distinct characteristics and nutritional profiles. They have
  different floral sources, flavors, and potential health benefits. Therefore, they
  should not be considered semantic and ontological duplicates and should be treated
  as separate entities.'
