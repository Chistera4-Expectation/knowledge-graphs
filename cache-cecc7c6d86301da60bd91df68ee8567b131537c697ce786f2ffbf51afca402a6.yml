  As a dietitian specializing in food seasoning, I would recommend merging "Fresh
  herbs such as cilantro" and "Fresh herbs" into one instance. This is because cilantro
  falls under the category of fresh herbs, so it can be considered redundant to have
  both listed separately. By combining them into one instance (e.g., "Fresh herbs,
  including cilantro"), you create clearer categories that better represent your knowledge
  base while avoiding unnecessary repetition.'
