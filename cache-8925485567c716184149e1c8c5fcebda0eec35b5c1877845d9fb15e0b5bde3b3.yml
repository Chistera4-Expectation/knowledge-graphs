text: As a dietician, I would suggest that the instances 'Fish fillet' and 'Fish'
  should not be merged together as they represent different forms of the same food
  item. 'Fish fillet' refers to a specific cut of fish, whereas 'Fish' is a more general
  term that encompasses the entire fish, including the fillet, bones, and other parts.
  While they are related, they are not semantic or ontologic duplicates. So, the answer
  is no.
