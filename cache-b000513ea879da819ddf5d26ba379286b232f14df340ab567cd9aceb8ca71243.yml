text: No, they should not be merged together. Although they may share some common
  properties, they are not semantic and ontologic duplicates. "Fat-Free Yogurt" and
  "Plain Yogurt" have different nutritional profiles, as one is fat-free, and the
  other may contain fat. These differences make them distinct entities in the context
  of yogurt classification.
