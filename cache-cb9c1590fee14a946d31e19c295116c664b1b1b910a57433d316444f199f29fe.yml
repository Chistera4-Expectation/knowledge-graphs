text: No, they should not be merged. Macadamia milk and whole milk are different types
  of milk, with distinct nutritional profiles and properties. Macadamia milk is a
  plant-based milk alternative made from macadamia nuts, while whole milk is an animal-derived
  product from cows. Although both are considered milks, they are not semantic or
  ontological duplicates.
