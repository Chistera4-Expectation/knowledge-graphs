text: No, the instances 'Ostrich Meatballs' and 'Pheasant Meat' should not be merged
  together as they are different types of poultry-derived food. Ostrich Meatballs
  refer to a specific dish made with ostrich meat, while Pheasant Meat refers to the
  meat of the pheasant bird itself. They are not semantic or ontological duplicates.
